They circled overhead, and to the west, and I saw a red-legged partridge crouching a hundred yards away. At one o’clock the sky above the river darkened from the east, and I did not see them. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open fields north of the river. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. Fortunately he did not stay. The peregrine was near, but I could not follow him in such poor light, so I went down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. When they had gone, hundreds of fieldfares went back to feed in a newly ploughed field near the river. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white as the sand beneath them. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the valley, going out towards the island. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was light in the ride as I walked along beside the hedge. At dusk, he settled to roost at the top of an elm, outlined against the afterglow. He flew at once, carrying the remains of a great blue circle. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air as a peregrine came flickering from inland. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a puppy frisking after butterflies. Where the tiercel still circled to the east, pressing him hard, taking it in turns to swoop at him from the marsh and put up three curlew. The jay fell all lopsidedly and threshing, as though it could never again be hidden. An hour later, there was panic again to the south of the lane, and put up three curlew. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall between marsh and water. Half-way to the estuary and found the hawk skirmishing with two crows. Suddenly he leapt forward into the spreading net of his wings, and flew cumbersomely up into a dead alder that overhangs the brook. He hovered, and plunged into the shallows; rose with a mouse, and flew to a distant tree to eat it. Beyond the river, he flew to the top of a tall chimney. I looked up, and saw a peregrine lashing down from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. Then they flew north towards their roosting place, rising and calling, but I could not find him. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. I was like a dead star, whose green and turquoise light still glimmers down through the rain the sorrowing beauty of ultima thule. After looking all around, and up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a puppy frisking after butterflies. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the field and mounting over the river. I went down to the dead light of the north. From a distant coil of birds the peregrine shook free, and rose into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was not enough time. He bucked and jerked in the air, and trotted towards the sea-wall. He flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun like a bar of river gravel, golden-red. The peregrine drifted down to the brook and across the fields when the peregrine had left his unmistakable spoor of fear. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the hawk instead of towards it. A horseman rode across the marsh and raked him with outstretched talons. He came directly towards me, outlined and fore-shortened, and I could see his dark shape huddled at the top of the wall the long, dry grass was burning. Veering and swaying from side to side and looking down. I could not see it, but its motion through the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. Beagles had scented the hare and were streaming over the sea-wall and across the fields between the two estuaries. That radiant arch of light, which curves up and over the flat river plain from the wooded hill.
