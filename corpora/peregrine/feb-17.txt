The crests of the higher fields are dappled brown and white, but snow is still a foot deep on the lower ground. Water flows in narrow channels through ice six inches thick. There are no blackbirds or thrushes in the valley now; no robins, hedge sparrows, or wrens. Only two feeble skylarks are left of the hundreds that were here in autumn. Three chaffinches remain from a flock of three hundred. Jackdaw numbers have been halved. Fifty woodpigeons have survived the shooting and the snow, but they are very thin and weak. Crows follow them everywhere, waiting for them to die. Two pairs of bullfinches have come through. There are blue tits and marsh tits in the woods, and a flock of long-tailed tits. There are eighty mallard and forty red-legged partridges in fields by the brook.
I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed recently by the peregrine, and had been plucked and eaten on the surface of the snow. The mallard was lying in the open field a hundred yards from South Wood. After striking down its prey, the peregrine had landed four yards away. There were two deep footprints in the snow, at the end of long, scored grooves. On each side were lighter scuffing marks made by the tips of the hawk’s wings. Shallower footprints led up to the kill and were clustered around it. Light parallel lines showed where the end of the hawk’s tail had dragged along the snow. The prints of the three front toes were short and blunt; that of the hind toe was three inches long, and was more deeply embedded. The tracks of a fox came out to the kill, and went back into the wood again. It had smelt the blood of the duck, and had gnawed the bones when the hawk had finished feeding.
