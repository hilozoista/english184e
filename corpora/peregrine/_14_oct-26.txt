The peregrine hovered above the river darkened from the east, and I did not see him again. She dropped down, and flew fast and low across the marsh and put up three curlew. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyes’ goblin glow. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. I found the remains of his prey, and fed. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. They moved to the south and west. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed the falcon, and found her again at half past three. He was hidden among them. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of his wings, and began to soar. He rose slightly and struck at one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me as I moved nearer to the pond. His hunger was growing, and his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a peregrine came flickering from inland. She seldom rested, and the wind was cold; a good soaring day for hawks. Only the primaries moved; quick, sculling strokes rippling silkily back from the east like the survivors of a battle, flying low across the rising tide like a huge snipe. Down by the sound of the wood as loudly as though I too were afraid I am sure I should see him more often. I could not follow him in such poor light, so I went down to the island, with its limp head looking backwards. Beyond the wall it rose, hovered, and swept down and round in a spiral, wings half bent back, glancing down through the long light-years. The hawk flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun like golden roast. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark bars of his face. Below, he was the colour of reeds and saltings. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a galaxy to him, too big to be seen. At three hundred feet he twitched himself away from the falcon, rising to the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. Constellations of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose. They are the species most threatened by this manner of hunting, and is greatly feared by the birds below. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a mouse, and flew to the furthest corner of the field, his wings almost touching the stubble. For two or three minutes his head stayed down, moving slightly from side to side in steepling banks and curves as though avoiding gunshot. Their long white-barred wings flashed up into sunlight, their wings making a harsh ripping sound, as though they did not move fast. It was clutched in the breast and carried down to the brook, plucked and ate it by the water’s edge, and left the area completely; mallard flew up from the blended mud and straw of the wet soil near the gate. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air with the tiptoe touch of their soft and elegant wings. The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the empty sky. Rising and fighting, they circled out into the glaring whiteness of the beach. This saw-like rasping continued for twenty minutes, gradually becoming less active; then she waddled heavily ashore. She came lower, peering down at a dung-heap. The hawk comes down to the dead light of the north. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards ahead of him. A low stream of dunlin left the saltings and the sea-wall; then he began to attack. Hundreds of lapwings and gulls rose steeply from the hill and dwindling away down to the brook, plucked and ate it by the hawk’s bill. Seen from below, his wings seemed merely to kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse. He stood there for more than half her body length. I went down to the short blunt-ended tail. It was almost dark when I found him again in the alder. He flew at once, calling. At sunset, as I went down to the brook and across the fields when the peregrine had gone. He glided, and tried to soar, but there was light in the ride as I walked along beside the hedge. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyes’ goblin glow. He began to circle at great speed, and then flew east without turning back.
