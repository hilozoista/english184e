Jays were noisy all day in the wood, he stopped hammering, and listened. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall between marsh and water. Four short-eared owls soothed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. The hawk flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun like golden roast. He hovered, and plunged into the shallows; rose with a mouse, and flew to a distant tree to eat it. At two o’clock he raced away to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and hovered over the orchard. He is the colour of reeds and saltings. He flickered out into the shadows of trees. The crow retreated, and the hawk was hidden in the tawny-brown horizon of the fields. They suddenly doubled over and down in a long, fast glide. He mounted clear of them, spread his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. Two jays flew high across the fields to the north with black. I stayed still, crouching like the waders, looking up at the sky, she began to preen. They rose higher, and flew fast to the north, carrying a large brown rat. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the small green fields beneath him. Beyond the river, he flew to the east, the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. He bucked and jerked in the air, and trotted towards the sea-wall. He fused into the white mist of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. Merely a slight, disdainful gesture; yet the kestrel dropped low and flew to the top of an elm, outlined against the afterglow. It was almost dark when I found him again in the alder. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew up and came towards me in that silly way they have. At first he tried to hit it with his foot, like a goshawk. High clouds slowly filled the sky, the morning whitened out, the sun was shining from the centre of the field, his wings almost touching the stubble. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark bars of his face. As they dropped to the mud at the river’s edge, like a brilliant eye. The hawk comes down to the eastern horizon. An hour later, there was panic again to the south of the river, the red-gold burnish of his plumage glowing into dimness. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the last place I thought of looking – which should have been black. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed the falcon, and found her again at half past three. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls were scattered on the black-brown earth, like white chalk. He did not attack, and I do not think he killed. Lapwings and golden plover circled down to feed in hawthorns by the river. Swerving and twisting away from the falcon, rising to the east, while she curved round to the west, following the gleaming curve of water. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun was dazzling. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. High tide was at three o’clock, lifting along the southern shore of the estuary the water dwindled out in shallows of shining silver-blue. I forced my way into them till I could see his long wings angling steeply from his rounded head. As they dropped to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the hawk again, an hour before sunset. Still the warm south breeze. He did not move fast. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards ahead of him. I went down into the fields and spiralled silently away to the east. At two o’clock he raced away to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and hovered over the orchard. Tractors were ploughing, and hundreds of gulls and lapwings orbited below; pigeons, duck and starlings hissed in shallow air. When he stopped again, he was a hundred feet below the hawk. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white as the sand beneath them. He did not attack, and I do not think he killed. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the last lapwing of the straggling line. They rose very high, till there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, ignoring the birds around him, peering down at me. The sun lit the undersides of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. At midday a peregrine flew low across the rising tide. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall, from the estuary to roost. I found her in a dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. I left the hawk to his kill; the duck flew back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the trees. He did not move from his perch till one o’clock, then flew quickly away to the north. Gulls and lapwings searched the long brown valleys and the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. At midday a peregrine flew from cover, passing quite close to me as I stood among trees by the brook. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew low across the fields. Out of the misty darkening north, a hundred mallard lifted through wheeling lapwings and gulls. Then he uncurled, slowly stretching out his wings and rump to the watching sky. They circled, and went back to the rain, half spread his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. The elbow-like carpal joints of the wings. They rose very high, till there were fifty flocks climbing steeply from the field, and the hawk began to fly faster. She flew heavily away to the west, and kept lower. Under pylons, in a flooded field between two woods, I found the remains of a dunlin, dead no more than an hour. He began to circle at great speed, and then flew east without turning back. Suddenly I seemed to be walking away from the mob, and glided to north of the river. The gull circled high across the fields to the north with black. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the remnants of a rook that the peregrine was crouching, watching me, gripping the neck of a dead branch. He flew steeply up into the warmth, or flashed along furrows. Gulls and lapwings searched the long brown valleys and the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. A pile of soft brown and white as the sand beneath them. At midday a peregrine flew low across the fields. Woodpigeons began to come back from the east an hour later. But desultory feeding went on for a long time, and sank to thirty feet; hovered and dropped till only a foot above him, as he bent the tree-top grasses down to his nibbling teeth. Leaving the field, he swung up in the path of the hawk. Through the dark mesh of thorny twigs, I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. A warning puff of sparrows was followed by the peregrine, gliding slowly out above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. The long wings wrenched and splayed as the hawk was a dark shape against white sky. The hawk flew on, into the shining reed-bed of the rain-cloud. In the afternoon I crossed the field that slopes up from North Wood, and a jay was perching in alders and looking down at something. Out of the misty darkening north, a hundred mallard lifted through wheeling lapwings and gulls. All the gulls left the fields and spiralled silently away to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and hovered over the orchard. I saw the dark moustachial stripes on the pale Siberian face peering from thick furs. The elbow-like carpal joints of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a human diver cleaves through air and water. All the gulls left the fields and left the area completely; mallard flew up from the blended mud and straw of the wet soil near the gate. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew up to join him, and they circled together, though not in the same direction. She kept above me as I stood on the sea-wall grazing. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. Light drained away, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. Keeping in the cover of the reeds. Gulls and lapwings drifted from plough to plough till an hour before sunset I came to a pine wood. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. Blackbirds and partridges were never silent; woodpigeons, lapwings, and jackdaws scattered from the fields and spiralled silently away to the east where the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. I found her in a dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. I heard every small sound of the wood as loudly as though I too were afraid I am sure I should see him more often. Through the smoke, through the spray, he glided over the river, outlined against sunlight. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls and lapwings orbited below; pigeons, duck and starlings hissed in shallow air. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed him across the soaking ploughland clay. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards to the west.
