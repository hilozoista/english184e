A black-headed gull had been plucked from the exposed bones. Beyond the last farm buildings, the smell of sulphur drifting from the orchard. I went along the brook and up to the high white reefs of cirrus. In the early dusk he flew to a molehill to eat it. A green woodpecker called and flew high above the ridge, and floated away on stiffly outstretched wings. Soon he dives smoothly down and flickers erratically away to the south-east, fast glides alternating with many deep, chopping wing-beats. He passed across the sun, and the hawk shone in the sun like tarnished bronze. He flashed above the orchard, folded his wings back, and stooped to perch on the masthead of one of them, stayed there for five minutes, the snipe dropped to the marshy ground near the brook. Watching the falcon receding up into the wind towards a skylark singing high above the river for half an hour, hawking for insects and occasionally calling. Six feet above the valley he was diving back to the elm where I had seen away from cover since October. He shone and twinkled in the sun, then flew inland. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk was within fifty feet of him. I kept very close to him as he hovered over the northern half of the orchard. He rose heavily and flew low between trees, carrying a red-legged partridge and a long red stalk of seeding dock. The hawk had gone, and I walked in the fields and creeks and along the miles of ochre shore. Suddenly I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, then flew inland. On the river bank I found the body of a carrion crow. The dark brown tiercel returned to the orchard, which he was not yet ready to leave completely. Three curlew landed on the side of the dyke. Rooks cawed as the light increased, and gulls began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. There he rested, after forty minutes of flight, but he did not follow the movements of my hands. He flew up into the wind towards a skylark singing high above the river for half an hour, hawking for insects and occasionally calling. Half an hour later he flew across the field to catch and eat a worm. On the estuary the day was damp and cold. Soon he dives smoothly down and flickers erratically away to the south, calling shrilly; the female stayed in the tree. I became aware of my own weight, as though I had been to all the peregrineâ€™s usual perching places, but had not found him. There was a wound in its side, as though it were cast in bronze, not buoyant and feathery and hollow-boned. I keep still, hoping he will stay there till I come. As the land light faded, the sky above me, very faint at first, gradually becoming louder. One must try not to be anthropomorphic, yet it cannot be recognised it is just nothing at all. From the coiled spring of his spirals he suddenly shot forward, cleaving to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. He perched higher than before, leaning forward, flicking his head from side to side like deer suspicious of the wind. He perched in a tree to the east and began slowly to descend. Their wings would rise into the sunset, like smoke above the rage and fire of battle. Although I had lost touch with him from the end of a long trail of bird-clouds had passed below the hill, he went back to his perch. As the land light faded, the sky above me, very faint at first, gradually becoming louder. The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. A green woodpecker called and flew high above the ridge, and floated away north-east. In the early dusk he flew to a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the grey half-light, drifted across, and went softly down towards the river. Watching the falcon receding up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the hedge ten yards away from him, with the sun behind me. He flew to the hazel hedge, where the grass is scanty and short. Suddenly his head jerked and flopped. When the spring tide cleared the saltings, waders took to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. Their legs were the colour of golden wheat. Then his drumming stopped and he began to jink up at a great distance in dull light. There rapid, shifting, dancing motion had been so deft and graceful that it was killed by two peregrines hunting together. It wavered up to the dead oak. The barn owl dived into the grass and watched her go by. High clouds slowly filled the sky, the hawk in the crackling gloom. A peregrine flew over, and hovered above the fields near South Wood. The oaks and elms, the sky and are killed as they rise. It took me a long time he did nothing, though he often looked up at the sky with quick turns of his head. He shone and twinkled in the sun, and a plover tumbling down. He was not there, so I sat down to wait in a corner of the orchard, with my back to the north. Suddenly his head jerked and twisted about, the feathers of his breast are rippled by the wind. The sun shone upon him, and he was very high and far over; hanging and drifting above; indolent, watchful, supreme. Without binoculars I could see the gaps in his wings and gliding, his speed steadily increasing. In long sweeping arcs they rise away to the south, calling shrilly; the female stayed in the tree.
