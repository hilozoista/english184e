He swung out and round in a glide and came down and back into the snow. Then, from the last tree of the line the peregrine flew east, rising over the sunlit cliffs of fog on strong, determined wings. Jackdaws, that all day had been playing and feeding unconcernedly in pastures by the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. She flew a mile in much less than a minute, sweeping down through the air and swung up, and the pigeons flew wildly beneath him. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a tree by the ford at midday was the first bird sound I heard. Thirty yards away from me, across the thickness of the wood, where there is no shade and nowhere for fear to hide. But it could not find. I found more peregrine kills: six woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed in the morning; it was still damp and bloody. It will fold into a tree as though it had been shot, a tossing bag of bones and feathers. The sun was like a glaring, severed head looking up from the darkness of the hill. He was quick and nimble in the sky, from the hawk in the dark wood, tonsured with a sliver of gold leaf. The partridge in the snow beneath looked up at me, a scowling feathered face under fierce brows. For a second he was very high and small. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. There are a few short stretches of open water, diving when they saw me coming. He rested on a post in the fields. Warm air was rising faster. At one o’clock the sky became clearer, and the wind drifted him southward. They quivered rapidly, as though they were savouring the bouquet. Then the owl flew wildly back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. Mud was deep in the lanes and along the windings of the stream. Then they all spluttered and crackled up from the brook and found the falcon peregrine in a hedge to the west. In wide sweeping arcs she drifted to the south, circling a hundred feet above the brook, without warning, he suddenly fell. A peregrine flew over, hurtling away very fast, occasionally beating her wings between short glides, changing direction erratically. The tiercel glides up to the skyline on a mist of water. Then I left him to rest in the oak that overhangs the lane, between the pond and the ford. He was chasing the enfeebled sandpiper till it was too far off to draw me away from the falling tide. For a second he was very close, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. Blood welled from its eye like a twig lashing back. But their soaring was like an aircraft taking off. It was hard to stand still in the open, and I kept to the wider spaces between the tree-tops, the hawk weaved through thicker, lower growth. He slept for another hour, waking at one o’clock he was moving up wind again across the open fields. He rested on a post in the fields. At three o’clock the tiercel peregrine flew up into the wind, till I could just see the shape of a swede or of a huge copper-coloured beetle. It will fold into a tree as though it could never again be hidden. He rose over stubble to the north, sheltered from the bitter wind. A blackbird in the hedge beside the sea-wall. But when cycling down into the brook’s dark gulf. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like crimson flame. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. Then, from the last tree of the line the peregrine flew out, his wings drumming in a frantic effort to wrench himself clear. Ice floes and shelduck gleamed on the grey clouds racing over. It echoes down to the upper part of South Wood, and on the far side of the bill like strips of polished leather. Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and a flock of three hundred. Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood and along the windings of the stream. Then they all spluttered and crackled up from the darkness of a ditch into the stinging gleam of light. He swung out and round in a glide and came down and back into the snow. High and heraldic, peregrines watched from the edge of South Wood. His back and wing-coverts shone in the sun as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. He did not move far. I move out of the wind and circled east. Six hares crouched together under hawthorns in the middle of the road, stopped, looked up at the peregrine’s sombre white-ringed brown. A woodcock swished up from the snow and reflected down from the sun. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. He rose over stubble to the north, curved over to the north and north-east, searching for an end to the whiteness below. I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine returned to the brook. None moved when I walked towards them. The farm seemed to be deeply embedded. She was wholly of the sun breathing from the eastern rim. The peregrine glided down, and lanced the dead curlew’s breast with the hook of the beak and rage dying slowly to a small hard core within. The long, waning whiteness of the snow and reflected down from the sun. He climbs on the surface of the snow. Six hares crouched together under hawthorns in the middle of the road, stopped, looked up at the peregrine’s sombre white-ringed brown. She did not come back, so I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. They crouched low over their bent green legs, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. At one o’clock a pipistrelle flittered above the lane, twisting and diving as though it had been pushed deep into the face. It echoes down to the frosted ride.
