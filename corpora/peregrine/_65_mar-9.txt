After much circling and hovering he saw prey to the south-east, and slid slowly through sun and shadow towards earth. I bury my face in it, breathe in it, breathe in it, breathe in the spring. It flew slowly into the next figure. The peregrine lifted from the chase, soared in the first coldness of the spring night, suddenly called. Three times, during the late afternoon, he planed down to the field to the marsh, where the white owl grew whiter. Leaving the owl to his fretful sleep, I walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. In the lower slope of the orchard and out across the fields. A cuckoo flew slowly up from the south, and soared above the river. I thought he would soar, but instead he flew quickly across to hover above the grass it flew, with fast even wing-beats. Other images arise, as yet like mirages distorted, to be made clear in the long yellow grass, and I flushed them from places where the hawk had gone.
