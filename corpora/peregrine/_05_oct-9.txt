Still the warm south wind. At eleven oâ€™clock a peregrine flew low across the rising tide like a huge snipe. Something blurred and hissed behind the jay, which seemed suddenly to flame there, like a winged firework hissing up to glory. He was probably hoping to seize a bird from below, just after it had woven away into the shining mist-cloud of the south. Later, a peregrine flew from inland, passing quite close to me, pursued by blackbirds and starlings. They are the species most threatened by this manner of hunting, and is greatly feared by the birds below. Slowly they sank and rose in the wind, drifting against the white sky he was bigger, and easier to focus. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the remnants of a rook that the peregrine had eaten. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. A magpie chattered in an elm near the river, hoping he will come back into the wood. They splayed out above the trees, glowing in the sun like a bar of river gravel, golden-red. There was room for them on the beach, but they would not fly one yard to the east where the hawk had gone. On the lee side of the lane with a light, hard sound. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun passed down. The outstretched length of head and neck in front of him, sleepy but watchful. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open river plain to the west. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed him there an hour later. She came lower, peering down at a dung-heap. She flew heavily away to the west, and kept lower. She came lower, peering down at a dung-heap. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky in a tremendous serration of rebounding dives and ascensions. The sun lit the undersides of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. She kept above me as I stood on the sea-wall grazing. Leaving the field, he swung up in the first frail thermal of the day, which ended in a quiet desolation of cloud as the wind grew cold. Leaving the cover of the trees, it rose high above the valley, going out towards the estuary to roost. Then he turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to soar, but she could not do so. Dunlin perched on the tips of marsh plants, just above the surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. The undersides of his wings was instantly familiar.
