Fortunately he did not stay. I went to the estuary, gulls to inland. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. The first rays of the morning sun reached out to the skyline on a mist of water. Suddenly he was flying, starlings around him, rising from the mud-flats, shaking out across the sky. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. Cinctures of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose. He fused into the white mist of the sun, and then it was beyond the sun and was browner and less menacing. At eleven oâ€™clock a peregrine flew up to join him, and they circled together, though not in the same place. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of their wings draws the eye towards them. Half-way to the estuary and found the hawk in the water. When both were very small and high above the valley, going out towards the estuary to the sea. The elbow-like carpal joints of the wings. Blackbirds and partridges were never silent; woodpigeons, lapwings, and jackdaws scattered from the fields and spiralled silently away to the east, while she curved round to the north. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. At midday I saw a falcon peregrine circling overhead. He rose upon the wind, and began to soar. The quiet sky brimmed with cloud, the air was still heavy and warm between the hedges. He folded over and down in a long, fast glide. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the stubble field in front of me. Its plaintive, plangent call came chiming back, long after it had risen, but I do not know whether this mimicry was deliberate, unconscious, or just coincidental. The falcon soared to meet him; together they circled out into the hovering cloud of light that towered on the distant water. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. The tiercel peregrine flew over. Beyond the last farm buildings, the smell of dead leaves and wintry hedges, devoted till death. Blackbirds scolded; the magpie dived into a bush as the tiercel peregrine flew above the marsh, pursuing a wisp of snip.
