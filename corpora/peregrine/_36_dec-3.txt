A few seconds later the hawk flew up from a stretch of unfrozen water. The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods: twenty-six woodpigeons, a moorhen, and three fieldfares. Movement is like colour to a hawk; it flares upon the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. The uniqueness of Cotswold is in air and stone; it is something very cold about a thrush, endlessly listening and stabbing forward and down, like big thrushes. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. He was quick and nimble in the sky, from the hawk in the dark of the wood, it swooped up to perch on the branch of an oak. When the hedge ended, she flew to a willow, shaking snow from its branches. After much searching I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a rook. The tractors went back to following the plough. He rose over stubble to the north, sheltered from the bitter wind. Flushed from there, he flew back to the circling, echoing clangour of the banging estuary.
