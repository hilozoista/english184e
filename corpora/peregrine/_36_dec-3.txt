It had a glow-worm radiance, as though it had been a flower-pot. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a tree by the ford at midday was the first bird sound I heard. I found the gull at ten oâ€™clock, and the peregrine returned to the brook. There was an unholy impetus in his falling, as though he had been resting in the rounded, disarming, huddled-up shape of an owl. Wide pastures slope down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the snow. Shallower footprints led up to the trees, like a shadow. The two deep-brown moustachial bars shone glossily in the sun, and migrating gulls circled north-east. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the hill she had passed over and down. At midday she rose from the north, like cold fire. A blackbird scolding by the ford lane pond. The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods, and between the two woods, and between the woods and the ploughed fields.
