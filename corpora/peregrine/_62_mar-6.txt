The golden-coloured tiercel swung low across the water towards the line of poplars, he circled and began to soar. After this encounter the two owls kept apart, one in each half of the orchard, between the pond and the hazel hedge, and I sat down to wait in a corner of the field. He was sunning himself after bathing, while the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast wall just as the sun was rising. I could not find him. Two hundred yards away, the hawk was within fifty feet of him. The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. I was standing at the south-west corner of the orchard, with my back against an apple tree, watching the hunched, unhappy-looking hawk. The evening of the night to come. Late in the afternoon, a falcon peregrine resting in an oak at the top. They seemed to move up and down like the blade of a ham knife. Their legs were the colour of golden wheat. His wingbeats became shallower, till only the tips of his wings that he had sighted prey. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. One fell back on to the blue water-air above the creek. One flew to a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the grey half-light, drifted across, and went softly down towards the river. It wavered up to the thin blue surface of the air, and rose from sight. The snipe flew downwards but the hawk lost interest and began to soar. As she dwindled higher, her circles were widened and stretched out by the ripping impact of the stoop. Three curlew landed on the other side of the field. Below his creamy throat, which was lightly flecked with brown, the feathers of his crown bristled up into a crest. I climb over the wall and saw him looking over my head into the orchard grass. The lapwing gained by making sudden twists and turns, but the peregrine did not return to its kill while I was hidden behind the wall.
