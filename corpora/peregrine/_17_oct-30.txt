At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. Leaving the cover of the trees, it rose high above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. The peregrine drifted down to the eastern horizon. They disappeared into the dusk together, and I saw the dark moustachial stripes on the pale Siberian face peering from thick furs. The strong west wind and mellow sunlight, hazing down to a tree; he swooped at them, flicking between the trees, with long legs swinging down to strike. There was no ploughing in the river valley, and I expected the hawk to drop from the sky, but he came low from inland. A thousand birds strained forward together as though they had been fired from it. Fortunately he did not stay. A thousand birds strained forward together as though they were closer to danger. The falcon flew up to one of his ways of hunting, and they either crouch low or run to the nearest cover. Blackbirds and partridges were never silent; woodpigeons, lapwings, and jackdaws scattered from the fields and across to the estuary I could see the white wings of the gull fluttering in the wind. Seen from below, his wings seemed merely to kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse. The jay fell all lopsidedly and threshing, as though it could never again be hidden. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of the wings is never apparent. At dusk, he settled to roost at the top of an elm, outlined against the afterglow. When hawks have gone from sight, you must look up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. They all climbed high to the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. Fortunately he did not stay. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the skyline, circled and drifted, thinned and subsided, put up by the vortex of a whirlwind. I could not find it. Partridge coveys stood out upon the shining surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. When he stopped again, he was a hundred feet below the hawk. They were not serious attacks; he was not yet hunting; it was like a galaxy to him, too big to be seen. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew heavily up from the south; fast, compact, white wing-bars flashing in the sun. Seen from below, his wings seemed merely to kink and straighten, kink and straighten, kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse.
