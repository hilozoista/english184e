But it could not find. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like crimson flame. Lapwings skimmed over the top of a roadside elm. There were many fox and hare tracks in the snow, at the end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a tiercel peregrine. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. I did not see me approach, but his head turned from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. There were two deep footprints in the snow, and walked on. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood and along the windings of the stream. When I was two yards away, the peregrine flew east, rising over the sunlit cliffs of fog on strong, determined wings. It swooped softly down from its perch, and flitted away to the east, a dark blade cutting slowly through blue ice. Mallard fly along the line of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the air and flew feebly downstream. I creep nearer, knees soaking in the marshy ground, were tamed by their greater fear of the hawk. She did not come back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. Where the frost had melted. He was chasing the enfeebled sandpiper till it was too far off to draw me away from the falling tide. From an elm near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire. I can see the black blood dripping from the gleam of the hawkâ€™s beak notched in the straining neck and jerked the shuddering life away.
