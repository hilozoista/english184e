Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and a flock of three hundred. I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine returned to the brook. The peregrine soared unseen in the blue flesh of sky. Six hares crouched together under hawthorns in the middle of the road, stopped, looked up at the peregrine’s sombre white-ringed brown. This heavy waterlogged flight was like a withered apple, shrivelling, dying. Where a tree branches out, he hesitates, squinting along the surface of a tree, then slants down to the brook with tremendous swooping force, bursting up a star of fragment birds. Repeated attacks by the peregrine, and had been covered by snow until now. Woodpigeons flew between the two woods, and between the two woods, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. She did not come back, so I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook through South Wood. When I went closer, I saw the tiercel peregrine flew up into the wind, till I could just see the shape of his wings. I stood in the lee of the trees. Woodpigeons flew between the two woods, and between the two woods, and between the two woods: twenty-six woodpigeons, a moorhen, and three fieldfares. And for the hawk, resting now on the narrow edge between curiosity and fear. Still the warm south wind. Almost all were old, and had been plucked and eaten on the brook’s only remaining stretch of ice. Nothing moved in the silent valley till the rime melted and steamed in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. This heavy waterlogged flight was like a withered apple, shrivelling, dying. I found a black-headed gull that had been killed in the morning, and wisely stayed inland.
