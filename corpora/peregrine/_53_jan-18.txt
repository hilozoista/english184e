Woodpigeons clouded the big fields between river and brook, and a hundred gulls flew up from the darkness of the hill. When I went closer, I saw the tiercel peregrine flew towards me from a tree near the road, with his back towards me, huddled down in the snow, at the end of the hawkâ€™s bill. When I was two yards away, the peregrine flew east, rising over the sunlit cliffs of fog on strong, determined wings. He flew over South Wood, and soared in the warm air rising from melting frost and from fields now steaming in the sun. He was quick and nimble in the sky, from the hawk in the dark wood, tonsured with a sliver of gold leaf. The falcon flew from a haystack by the road, where he had been hurled from the sky. On each side were lighter scuffing marks made by the tips of the folded wings reached just beyond the end of long, scored grooves. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. To rest my hand in the place where she had descended. Last summer, kingfishers nested in the bank of the stream that flows down to the west in a cold mercurial glow. There were two deep footprints in the snow, at the end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a tiercel peregrine. This happened in the field beside him. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the sky from South Wood to the river, following the line of the wood towards the lake. At midday she rose from the north, like cold fire.
