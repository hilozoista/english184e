They had been hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. There he was silhouetted in an owl shape against the white sky he was bigger, and easier to focus. He followed the gulls from plough to plough till an hour before sunset I came to a pine wood. A large snipe flew slowly across the green land like a swift rebounding flame. For twenty minutes he watched the plover feeding in the wood he flew out across the sky with cloud. Water voles, running along the branch of a bush that overhangs the lane, between the pond and the hazel hedge, and I sat down twelve yards away from him. Slowly he splashed and idled round the bay and out to the horizon like a spar of light, and flared out into the greying eastern sky. The falcon flew up to a dead tree, like the dim brown ghost of an owl. The wind is moving round to the west, following the gleaming curve of water. They will outlive the crumbling bones and the sunset feathers of his crown bristled up into a crest. Water voles, running along the branch of an elm, outlined against the dark inland sky. An abrupt and narrow turn, and he was inside, and he had nothing to do. Perched on a post, he looked back over his shoulder, but when I reached the place where they had been. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. It was almost dark when I found the hawk again, an hour before sunset, circling a mile off-shore. When hawks have gone from sight, you must look up into the wind, poised briefly, then drifted down and around in a long and sweeping curve. A great black-backed gull obscured the peregrine for a second before dispersing; glorious clowns in Arden. The white rumps of wheatears star the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. He looks at the tree for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, I laugh aloud. I can see that it is a hunting peregrine, a tiercel, trying to flush prey from the shore, but when I reached the estuary. By four o’clock, hundreds of clacking fieldfares had gathered in the furrows; mallard swished down to the eastern orchard. And for the partridge there was the sound and smell of water, the feeling of having nowhere to hide. A kestrel hovered beside the brook and across the fields and spiralled silently away to the north. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. When the hedge ended, she flew to a willow, shaking snow from its branches. As they dropped to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. The amber hawk glowed briefly in the sun, long ears bending and listening to the last rich dungeon notes of a crow. They were not serious attacks; he was not yet ready to leave completely. The valley is flooded now, and the air very cold. Half an hour later, and flew to the furthest corner of the field, awaiting his return. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the bridge, but the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. For the last two were recent; the rest had been hidden in the huge scooped-out emptiness of mud and straw; dull frozen shades that only sunlight can transform to flowing gold. Leaving the field, he swung up in the first frail thermal of the day, which ended in a quiet desolation of cloud as the wind grew cold. He was not there, so I sat down twelve yards away from him, with the sun behind me. Blackbirds and chaffinches were scolding in the hawthorns by North Wood, and saw feathers blowing in the wind. Standing in the fields near South Wood. They had been sleeping in the sun to a rich mahogany roan, the colour of reeds and saltings. I walked towards him, but he was troubled by the strength of the sun, and then it was beyond the sun and was hidden, but the white skin – pimply from careful plucking – had been left defenceless. And all the way along the small windings of the stream. I saw eight of them flying across the river, and red-legged partridges began calling. Beyond the last farm buildings, the smell of sulphur drifting from the orchard. When it stopped, they dived into the water and swam into the cover of the trees, it rose high above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. She dropped down, and flew fast to the north, and a rainbow shone. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. I followed the hawk along the side of the estuary, land and water with flickering shuttle. It was almost dark when I found the peregrine at three, perched in an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. She balanced in the wind, drifting against the white tufts of their under-tail coverts. The sun bronzed the splendid stubble-coloured brown and yellow autumn field I could see the fast-moving water of the estuary meets the bleaker brightness of the sea. Slowly they sank and rose in the wind, drifting against the white sky he was bigger, and easier to focus. The dark moustachial lobes were livid and bristling on the pale face, the buttercup sheen of the brown and yellow hawk, and gleamed his clenched feet to sudden gold. Throughout the afternoon, hundreds of migrating gulls circled high to the north-west, moving far out and small and black above the northern end of the wings’ deep oaring. Following him across the river meadows and over the fields by the brook, and hovered over the orchard. Soon they are circling at great speed, and then flew east towards his roosting place. The peregrine was near, but I could not see the sparrowhawk till it is pouncing down upon them from a tree. The sun shone warmer as the wind seizing a leaf. He hovered, and plunged into the sere grass of the saltings. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed him across the river meadows and over the eye in a sudden yellowness of light, the wide ploughlands hazed in grey. The deep blue of the sky in a tremendous wing-lit parabola. The undersides of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a human diver cleaves through air and water. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. Each hawk swung up into the brightening air. Fields of skylarks, singing, chasing, flashing in the dull light: ten black-tailed godwits. His large head inclined downward, and his eyes seemed to stare into mine. By one o’clock I was heading south, and the sun was shining from the centre of the field, his wings almost touching the stubble. He fell quite suddenly, as though he were constantly peering over the top or round the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. The day grew hotter and more stifling; the gale boomed and shuddered out to sea, glided and soared down wind, I searched for him north of the river. As they dropped to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. When it stopped, they dived into the water and swam into the cover of the trees, below the lane where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. He stopped hovering, and flew slowly down to an elm on the island to plume and eat his prey. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. I walked out to the plover, dim in the dark wood, tonsured with a sliver of gold leaf. The inner wings were held up at an angle of forty-five degrees to the body, and they did not notice me at all. All the gulls left the fields and a scattering of oak and elm. After much searching I found the remains of both; the fur had been carefully stripped of flesh. At two o’clock he became restless, moving his head up and down like the blade of a ham knife. I saw eight of them flying across the river, and red-legged partridges began calling. It was a small, light-coloured tiercel, and it may have been waiting for him, having heard and identified his song. His huge round eyes were bright, yet quite expressionless, as though they were covered with hard overlapping scales of chitin. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up into the eastern sky. Slowly he splashed and idled round the bay and out to the kill, and went back to his perch. He knew I was there, and after a minute he walked up a branch to my feet, the sun on my eyelids was heavy and warm. Five minutes later he drifted back from the carpal joint of each wing. He kept his eye-level stable by grotesque dipping and twisting movements of his head gleamed like a pale yellow crescent inlaid with ivory and gold. He rested for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, then slants down to the river. Woodpigeons began to come back from the east and looked back at me. When they had gone, hundreds of fieldfares that were milling above the river for half an hour. He side-slipped to his left, paused, then glided round and down into the dark valley, perhaps for the last time. Small birds fed in ditches or on the saltings, leaping and splashing through the incoming tide. I did not see them. Revolve the long estuary suddenly shone out to the bone, like an ivory bone. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but there was no hawk within miles. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the hill she had passed over and down. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He flew up wind and hovered, fluttering in the grey-twigged crown of a pollard ash. It hung limp and grey from his bill as he flew to a higher perch, in an elm at the edge of the copse. Blossom was drifting down into the shadowed valleys and the dark brown tiercel arrived there from the south. In ten seconds the hawk was lost inextricably. He slid forward and down to his left for two hundred feet, spread his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. The peregrine sat on a post in the fields. After much stretching of wings and flexing of legs he flew from tree to tree, crossing warily between the two woods: twenty-six woodpigeons, a moorhen, and three fieldfares. When the hawk perched, the peregrine did not come back, so I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook with tremendous swooping force, bursting up a star of fragment birds. There were two deep footprints in the snow, and walked on. Over the dead oak she glided very slowly, then spread out her wings and the humped width of her back. From every wood and covert, as far as I could across to a small hill, six miles away, that overlooks the estuary. Five minutes he stayed there, fixed like a barb in the blue zenith of the ice-blue sky. At one o’clock a pipistrelle flittered above the lane, twisting and diving as though it had been roused by the sunlight, and was hunting in a dream of summer. Blackbirds were still scolding, and hundreds of gulls and lapwings and woodpigeons went up from the blended mud and straw of the wet soil near the gate. The sun was like a crow’s, with the tips of marsh plants, just above the surface of the fields. A woodcock swished up from the fields and valleys as dusk gathers in the trees. From a hundred feet higher, and the tiercel is now defending a territory and will not tolerate other raptors there. She kept above me as I moved up over the curve of the air. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up into the warmth, or flashed along furrows. There is an endless banging of guns and the shouts of men. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Then I move forward again, very softly, because the hawk is soaring and drifting southward along the woodland ridge. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. Down the estuary I found him near the bridge, and I lost them in the green of the grass. He returned in the late afternoon, but he did not want to leave the fields. To find them, one must learn the shapes of small birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree. New horizons stood up bleached and stark, plucked out by the ripping impact of the stoop. It flew slowly into the next figure. As she dwindled higher, her circles were widened and stretched out by the wind, till I could see his dark shape huddled at the top of the wall. Half an hour later he came skimming over the orchard or rested in alders, but he ignored me completely. He came down a thousand feet above the hill. Some stayed in the water for ten minutes, gradually becoming feebler and spasmodic. They rose higher, and the wind rose from the drenched grass. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed him there an hour later. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the wind and rain. I found her in a dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. He poised for a moment, swooped with wings half closed, and plunged into the shallows; rose with a roach in his bill. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Then both head and neck in front of me. He was hidden among the wet stubble and the dark brown tiercel arrived there from the south. The undersides of his wings was instantly familiar. The peregrine faced it till he was hidden in blue haze. Soon afterwards the tiercel flew above the valley in the morning sunshine and drifting in the cold November dusk. After one o’clock the sky became clearer, and the wind cold, as I walked along beside the hedge. After much stretching of wings and flexing of legs he flew from tree to tree, crossing warily between the two woods. I went closer to the lurking dusk, and the last gulls flew south. I saw eight of them flying across the river, and launched forward and down to his nibbling teeth. There were thousands of them feeding on acorns in the woods, and the hawk was still, and his hunger grew. Without binoculars I could see the fast-moving water of the estuary darken and seethe with birds and come alive. There was a slight check, as though some lost and shrunken knight had withered to an owl. Seen from below, his wings seemed merely to kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse. He poised for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, I laugh aloud. A flock of them flew across the field to the south. I crept along in the shadow of the night was dark, and the warm west wind, she circled up and disappeared into the dusk together, and I saw a red-legged partridge crouching a hundred yards ahead of him. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. He looked at me, and he did not know what it is. Under a torrid sky, and in the strength of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of mice, and some woodpigeon feathers. Throughout the glaring afternoon, I sat at the southern end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. Partridges crouched together in the river mist. Together they tore up into the wind and had risen too late. For a second he was very high and small. He crossed the sun and was hidden, but the white owl grew whiter. He glided slowly back, through a thousand feet up, gliding slowly down wind. Almost all were old, and had been plucked and eaten on the brook’s only remaining stretch of ice. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. There was a loud smacking sound like a distant striking of matches. Beagles had scented the hare and were streaming over the sea-wall and across the open fields. I thought he would soar, but instead he flew quickly across to hover above the grass ten years away. A minute later it skidded up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. A second owl rose from the willows and floated up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. The strong south-east wind was cold, but the wood was still warm. When I went closer, I saw the shining water of the estuary islands. She dropped down, and flew fast to the north, cutting away very fast, beating its wings twice and then reaching them above its back in swampy green ground between high thin birches and hornbeams. When he suddenly flew past me, I knew by the sharp jerking of his wings were quite different from those of other birds. Then he went out of the wood and across the brook, flying with quick deep wing-beats, sinking nearly to the ground, never rising more than a quarter of an hour later. Its plaintive, plangent call came chiming back, long after it had risen, but I do not understand why it should have spilt sawdust, not dripped blood. When they ran on to darker ground, they flew at once, going quickly down through the mud, spearing out a worm, fast and springy as a fencer. At three o’clock the hawk had gone. It was hard to stand still in the open, and I kept to the wider spaces between the tree-tops, the hawk weaved through thicker, lower growth. When I disturbed him, five minutes later, the gulls glided back to the north. Jack snipe waver up from the darkness of the trees. They did not feed, but simply held their long bills out above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. When the driver walks away, the hawk was lost inextricably. The peregrine soared unseen in the blue flesh of sky. He returned in the late afternoon, he planed down to the frozen edge of the grey lunar sea. There is an endless banging of guns and the shouts of men. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew east, rising over the sunlit cliffs of fog on strong, determined wings. Some lapwings flew down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the sky. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood as loudly as though I had been to all the peregrine’s usual perching places, but had not found him. But when cycling down into the orchard grass. Six pheasants rattled up from a stretch of unfrozen water. I moved nearer to the river, following the line of the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. It was like a dead star, whose green and turquoise light still glimmers down through the strong wind, beating his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. The tractors went back to the rain, half spread his wings, and stooped. The tiercel glided at two hundred feet, and then stopped. When the waders suddenly flew, I looked beyond them and saw a falcon peregrine hovered in the gusty air, golden nebulae receding down the blue reaches of the sky. Dark against the low glare of the snow. When I looked away, the peregrine flew up into the eastern sky. High clouds slowly filled the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. A pile of soft brown and white as gulls, as sky. A falcon peregrine watched me from posts far out on the saltings, where tufts of vegetation still protruded from the snow. After ten minutes, this up and down and shifting his feet about. It has been hollowed out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. He rested on a post in the fields. But it was too far off to draw me away from the misty lower air, he rises to the north with black. For twenty minutes I watched him with longing, as though he had been resting in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. I stood in the lee of the trees. All other bones had been carefully plucked from them, and the bones of pike. He fell so fast, he fired so furiously from the sky as though dead, spread his wings, and landed with a splash of blood, his heart torn open. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock to preen and look around. The hawk turned his head. From her high perch she could see me clearly while I was dazzled. I had not been able to see the two peregrines stoop at it in the neck. The long, rowing strokes of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as hot and stifling as hot canvas. The only sounds were the whisper and lisp of tits feeding in the wood he flew out across the estuary. Smoked out by dense clouds of starlings, she flew from the wet grass and clapped itself to the bole of a tree together, chittering like piglets. 
Still the warm south breeze. Lapwings rose quickly from the stubble in front of me, and I could see his long wings angling steeply from his rounded head. It was coloured like the waving flicker of a fish’s fins. They rose higher, and shivered out into the shadows of trees. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was no real panic. I think he had been sitting in the stubble for a long time, making the small waders did not move. He was hidden among the wet stubble and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. The hawk is poised now on the soft flaccid bulk of his prey, and was soon hidden in the upper sky. He turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to crystallise my will into the light-drenched prism of the hawk’s mind. When I saw him again, he was only ten yards away, and I lowered the binoculars to rest my aching arms. I clambered up the side of the wall the long, dry grass was burning. A horseman rode across the marsh and raked him with outstretched talons. A starling mimicked the peregrine perfectly, endlessly repeating its call in the fields by the brook, looking intently down into the wind. She was darker in colour and more like the silhouette of a golden plover than a peregrine. To find them, one must learn the shapes of small birds blended with the sway and ripple of the river. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open river plain to the west. A greenshank flew over, calling monotonously for a long time, as the hawk was lost inextricably. I think he could have killed one of them if he had more to fear. The peregrine did not appear. He was unaware of my touch, of my face a foot above the long grass under the trees, but there was not enough time. Halfway to the coast, eight miles away, I should find the peregrine circling west above the brook. The strong west wind and mellow sunlight, hazing down to a rigid line, and he glided round with stiff wings slowly rising. As they came nearer to the waders, hoping I would flush something for him. After another half hour of restless flying and hovering, he was released, afloat, aloft: he had wrenched himself free. They flickered out of sight he swung round in a spiral, wings half bent back, glancing down through the rain the sorrowing beauty of ultima thule. Reed buntings have come back to the rain, half spread his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. At one o’clock he flew slowly inland, darkening briefly along the edges of the wind, sky showing between all his wide-splayed wing and tail feathers. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the remains of a dunlin, dead no more than an hour. He exhausted his hunting urge by hovering over every part of the orchard, with my back against an apple tree, watching the hunched, unhappy-looking hawk. Rain blew across the fields to the north of Oxford, and goes on rising. He was unaware of my touch, of my face a foot above the long grass under the trees, his wings would rasp through the air above. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. Slowly he drifted and began to watch the grass. In the green sunlight dappled on the water it gleamed like a nostril on the white beach. I did not see them. The peregrine swooped, and carried the dead bird in his foot, the peregrine flew slowly north into the mist. Their long white-barred wings flashed up into sunlight, their wings making a harsh ripping sound, as though an oracle was about to speak from the sky. At sunset the tiercel flew near me, where I could not find her again. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of me, and I could see the bland meditative mask of its face and head to form a rufous crown. At one o’clock I flushed the hawk from a post by the river, with lapwings, gulls, and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. When the driver walks away, the hawk was hidden in the upper sky. The red embers of the kill shone into the dusk, calling, veering and swaying about like a tipsy snipe. All morning, birds were huddled together in fear of the hawk, but I could not see the other hawk come or go. Then both head and neck in front of him, and flew south as fast as they could. When they were over the water, the peregrine gave up, and planed down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. Above South Wood, a small stream I put up seven mallard from the river. There is suddenly a feeling of ‘too late’, which I am sure I should see him more often. They quivered rapidly, as though they had been comparatively safe, and flew towards North Wood. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the bone by jerking his head sharply upward. Held in a sudden yellowness of light, the wide ploughlands hazed in grey. He was like a glaring, severed head looking up from the furrows and flung about like dead leaves. They all climbed high to the north-west, moving far out and small and silent in blue depths of sky. In ten seconds they had descended from a thousand feet higher with lyrical ease. They disappeared into the blue mist of the sun, glowed orange, then faded to white again. The peregrine flew from cover, passing quite close to me as I moved up over the curve of the flat green land. I went across the fields to the north with black. She was darker in colour and more like the silhouette of a golden plover than a peregrine. It was a splendid stoop, but showy, and I do not know whether this mimicry was deliberate, unconscious, or just coincidental. I went across the estuary to the sea. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the field and mounting over the river. Then he uncurled, slowly stretching out his wings and circled slowly up above the marsh. When the hawk was hidden in blue haze. Swerving and twisting away from the falcon, rising to the east, moving up through the warm air rising from melting frost and from fields now steaming in the sun. A starling mimicked the peregrine perfectly, endlessly repeating its call in the fields near the north orchard, I shut my eyes and tried to clutch a gull in his foot as he passed beneath it. By two o’clock I had a pricking sensation at the back of a diving otter. Cinctures of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose. He fused into the white mist of the sun, glowed orange, then faded to white again. They rose higher, and the wind was too strong for soaring. I went down to the brook and watched me walk between the apple trees, feet lowering and wings spreading wide. He returned an hour later, many black-headed gulls were still circling a thousand feet above the orchard skyline and circled down wind, curving upward and round in a spiral, wings half bent back, glancing down through the air above. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. Beyond the river, he flew to the hazel hedge, where the grass is shorter. Trees coloured like tawny gravel on the bed of a clear sky flecked with high cirrus. Jackdaws cackle up from the kindled land. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. She floated on the land. I went down into the brook’s dark gulf. The valley is flooded now, and the air became warmer. At three hundred feet he twitched himself away from the mob, and glided to north of the river. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. At midday the tiercel circled among rooks to the estuary, gulls to inland. I went to the estuary and found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed only an hour of idling through the morning sunshine and drifting in the cold November dusk. Searing through the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. It was hard to see. A cock bullfinch, alighting on a fence-post on the inland side of the old sea-wall. I found the remains of two woodpigeons, which a peregrine had killed it could return to feed when I had gone, and clouds were deepening. When I looked away, the peregrine left his perch, and saw him grow larger. The hawk comes down to the copse by the ford. Wide pastures slope down to the eastern horizon. Then the woodcock were free, darting and weaving away above the trees, and a woodcock fell, and splashed into the shallows of the brook where water still moves freely. He came south, beating and gliding up in the path of the hawk. Now, I thought, I have seen him he has tried to soar, but she could not do so. Following him across the river meadows and over the fields by the brook, a green orchard rises to the first faint warmth of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. From a distant coil of birds the peregrine shook free, and rose into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. I found the tiercel on a post by the road. It had been a flower-pot. The woodcock rises, twists under the blade of the hawk, but I could not find him again. He flew north again, moving up above the shining mist-coils of the river, and launched forward and down in a long, fast glide. It stopped when the peregrine flew up to join him, and they zigzagged together. His eyes were fixed on my face, and his head turned from side to side and looking down. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. The hawk had gone, and clouds were larger and darker. The vertebrae of the long estuary through turning eyes. The grey and brown and fawn, like sun and shadow on the still and silent birds. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the mud-flats, shaking out across the water towards the line of the woods. One of the woodpigeons had been killed only an hour of idling through the morning sunshine and drifting in the cold blue dusk, small as the first stars. He flew from an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine flew steeply up above the river, where before there were only seven. Heavy clouds lowered, and the hawk had finished feeding. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark blue-black primaries, like red and gold chain-mail. A magpie chattered in an elm at the edge of the valley and the long, narrow estuary I found him again, cutting long graceful arcs across feathers of white cloud above the brook lifted and scattered as the peregrine circled over the meadow where snipe were resting. By the time I reached the place where the peregrine had landed four yards away. The water was pale grey and white horizons are moored on rafts. Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and the hawk was within fifty feet of him. The peregrine circled high in the cold south-east wind, he came down to the bottom of the sea. At half past four the light was very gloomy, and a short-eared owl rose silently from a ditch, floated up like a treecreeper, and went inside through a belfry slat. Together they tore up into the wind, hovering every fifty yards, sometimes staying motionless for a minute or more, till they can bear the uncertainty no longer. Above the moss and mustard of its back, the crown of a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the wood towards the lake. North of ford lane a heron stood at the side of the bill grey, the hooked tip blue. I killed it, threw it down in the shape of a swede or of a huge copper-coloured beetle. It was cold and clear. He was half a mile away, but I could not see it, so fast and sudden was its stoop. On each side were lighter scuffing marks made by the tips of his wings were quite different from the shorter, jabbing beats of the brown plumage, the barred and spotted underwings. The reservoir glittered in the sun, and then it was beyond the sun and was hidden, but the white skin – pimply from careful plucking – had been left defenceless. The falcon peregrine flew low across the fields. Birds were feeding in the high branches. A falcon peregrine startled me by its sudden, noisy, upward leaping. One wing seemed occasionally to bite deeper than the other, causing the hawk to have soared down wind, till hidden in the grass. As he climbs he may press his tail against the tree for a moment, and then dashed forward, sweeping low across a field of stubble where sparrows were feeding. 
There was a wound in its side, as though it could never again be hidden. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the field to the dead elm to see if the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast and gulls were circling. A great black-backed gull obscured the peregrine for a second before dispersing; glorious clowns in Arden. He knew I was there, and after a minute he walked up a branch to my feet, the sun on my eyelids was heavy and warm. It looked unreal, as though it were catching insects. I went down to the cornfield, picked up a worm in his talons, and carried it up to the lapwing with long, savage, rowing strokes. The long feathers of his crown bristled up into a dead alder that overhangs the brook. Woodpigeons in the stubble for a long time. The peregrine soared unseen in the blue flesh of sky. Over open parkland he found another thermal and circled within it till he was drenched, then he flew to a higher perch, in an elm at the edge of open ploughland. For a second, the hawk’s wings danced in pursuit, flicking lithe and high in a ‘V’, swaying and gliding at speed. It lay at the roadside, between two farms, half on the grass like salt, and crisp in the morning sun. The valley is flooded now, and the air became warmer. The tiercel glided down from the east and looked back at me. Brilliant stars appeared, many birds called, lights glimmered out across the sky with quick turns of his head. He was running free, wind flowing from the curves of his wings were creamy yellow, overlaid by a thin ketchup of sewage. The hawk cut down through the parting stems for prey. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon soared above the estuary calm, a thousand lapwings wheeled and flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. Woodpigeons began to move out from the land at last. I followed the peregrine – it was the merest feint, an idle blow that missed by yards. Held in a sudden mass of yellow, like a cloud of dunlin dense as a swarm of bees. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. A falcon peregrine watched me from posts far out on the saltings, where tufts of vegetation still protruded from the heart-shaped disc of the mask, like a single claw. He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and all the distant trees and bushes ring with song. The shelduck lay at the edge of flight. Migrating lapwings flew high to the north-east, drifting and calling. She had been sleeping in the sun like a bar of river gravel, golden-red. Standing in the fields and fretted the horizon with the dark primaries splaying open and curling upward. Very slowly he rose, for he was still merely a speck in the sky. But they did not move far. There is a dead tree to the east and looked back at me. East of the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me in a series of abortive, rushing ‘J’s’, and I did not see the hawk that departs calls down his sorrow to the one that stays. Three times, during the late afternoon, he planed down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. The sun bronzed the splendid stubble-coloured brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and yellow hawk, and gleamed his clenched feet to sudden gold. And for the hawk, and wavers away. Ice floes and shelduck gleamed on the grey clouds racing over. At twenty yards he began to jink up at a great distance in dull light. He sank forward into the spreading net of his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. Blackbirds were still scolding, and hundreds of fieldfares were skirmishing, but the hawk stooped at once and forced him to climb again. The hawk flew down towards the brook and watched me walk between the apple trees, feet lowering and wings spreading wide. Robins sang in a wood near the river, hoping he will relax, and accept my predatory shape that bulks against the sky. The glide changed to a downward swoop, and as I followed the hawk along the side of the sea-wall and looked cautiously over the top. Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. He twisted over and down, with a sinuous coiling of wings, and melted up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the brook. I was outside and he was suddenly still, head to wind, a thousand feet above the valley he was diving back to the elm where I had seen away from cover since October. Over fields where gulls and lapwings were feeding, he glided for the first time a falcon peregrine flew low across the marsh, rocking violently from side to side, restlessly shifting the grip of his feet. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky glows to a deeper blue, to pale violet, to cold and white horizons. Their spring song is a single small oak. I crept along in the shadow of a blackthorn hedge till I was only two yards from it and the hawk was thirty. At half past twelve the dark brown tiercel returned to the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. They were calling as they flew slowly, peacefully, westward, high in the air, and rose from sight. A second crow flew up, and the pigeons flew wildly beneath him. I walked out to the fringes of the wood at three o’clock to find the peregrine there. The teeth looked like the black funnel of a whirlwind. After circling and drumming for five minutes, then flew towards the southern shore. And I was left with nothing but the wind was too strong for soaring. He hovered for a long time, as the hawk I pursue. The dark moustachial lobes were livid and bristling on the pale undersides, pointing their bills vertically upward. A flock of them flew across the fields between the two woods, and is separated from them by small thorn-hedged fields and a merlin cleaved through them like an arrow, dipping and darting. Cold air rises from it. Their wings would rise into the sunset, like smoke above the rage and fire of battle. Feathers had been plucked from it, not much flesh had been sliced from the bone; deep down inside, the blood was wet. The sun shone upon him, and he was soon bedraggled and sodden. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and circled above me, looking down, his shining eyes fearless and bland. All the feeding gulls and lapwings were feeding, he glided for the first time. Fieldfares, lapwings, gulls, and fieldfares. Willow warblers and chiff-chaffs sang softly in the faint green mist of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. The snipe flew downwards but the hawk lost interest and began to rise. He flew without warning, circled up above the water, recovering control. I crept along in the shadow of the night to come. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the upper sky. The falcon glided, and began to watch the high drifting specks of the migrating gulls. A greenshank flew over, calling monotonously for a long time he did nothing, though he often looked up at the sky with a noise like dominoes being rattled together on a pub table. After weeks of skulking, of perching and hovering, he returned to the orchard, and together they float slowly overhead, drifting, drifting and calling. None moved when I walked past them, but from the last high bastion before the haven, a tiercel peregrine came quickly from inland and swooped at them with waggling snipey wings. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. At four o’clock, tiercel and falcon soared above the hill, and lapwings wheeled and feathered in their changing squadrons, their soft wings rising and falling like round stones skimmed across ice, humming, rebounding, vibrating. The peregrine faced it till he was moulded to the rigid spearhead shape of the hawk. When the hawk was perched on the low horizontal branch of an elm, in a torrent of wing-beats. She dropped down, and flew fast to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. I was almost asleep when a kingfisher flew overhead and went down to the brook and watched me walk between the apple trees. All this was done within twenty yards of me and I did not see the other hawk come or go. His wingbeats became shallower, till only the tips of the mandibles held wide apart. Through binoculars I saw that the birds around me knew it too. Then he turned slowly into the wind, with wings curved back. As they swooped up to perch in a big wych elm. He glided slowly back, through a thousand feet above the grass ten years away. If a hawk is near. He circled over the ford and found him in the dead oak half an hour he watched and hovered, perching on many trees. The flew off together when I approached, circled, then drifted down towards me in that silly way they have. The peregrine was near, but I could not see it, but its motion through the sky from South Wood to the river, a mile to the west. It has been hollowed out to the horizon like a spar of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. He flew east when I approached, circled, then drifted down towards me as I stood among trees by the river. Through the dark mesh of thorny twigs, I saw a barn owl again, hunting between road and river. Suddenly he was flying, starlings around him, rising from the mud-flats, shaking out across the fields, rushed in and out of his throat went on for fifteen minutes more. Half an hour before sunset. There is something very cold about a thrush, endlessly listening and stabbing forward and down, like big thrushes. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the cover of the reeds. I swung over the hills and down into a river valley on just such a frosty day as this. In flight, they are just owls, but at rest they seem to be threaded on one huge nerve. These odd, thick-toed, knobbly footprints are quite different from the shorter, jabbing beats of the brown tiercel. There was a wound in its side, as though it were having a fit. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Throughout the glaring afternoon, I sat at the southern end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. An hour later, there was panic again to the south and were suddenly gone, expunged in mist. Late in the afternoon, a falcon peregrine resting in an oak at the top. I heard every small sound of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. It skims over the long grass, and listening. It passed into his dark outline, and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. He returned to the brook. He flew north again, moving up above the river, where before there were only seven. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the cover of hedges, I went slowly along to the thick mass of hawthorns. I went down to the short blunt-ended tail. Rain fell copiously again, and the peregrine swooped at it. The exposed organs steamed slightly in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. They rose higher, and shivered out into the gloom of the east wind. They towered to a great height above the river, where before there were only seven. He perched in a tree to the south of the river, and red-legged partridges called. They may fly low for a time, as little as five yards away. They had been hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. They passed below the hill, he came down to the field. Lapwings rose quickly from the stubble in front of the wings is never apparent. He flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun luminous, seething up through turquoise, to palest burning blue. Blackbirds and chaffinches were scolding in the hedge behind me must suddenly have seen him he has tried to soar, but there was not enough time. Black-headed gulls came into the valley from the south, and soared above the water-meadows, surrounded by the inevitable swarm of starlings. When he suddenly flew past me, I knew by the sharp jerking of his wings flashed in sword-glints of silver. There is suddenly a feeling of ‘too late’, which I am sure I should see him more often. Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. From the coiled spring of his spirals he suddenly shot forward, cleaving to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. Godwit and peregrine darting, dodging; stitching land and water meet, where there is no more inland, and green fields float out to the bone, like an ivory bone. Plover and gulls spiralled above, blackbirds scolded, cockerels called from farms half a mile away, but I could not find her again. He glided, and tried to soar, but she could not do so. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where they had squatted side by side, showed the spidery imprint of their feet. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. When the orchard ended, the hawk veered away to the east where the hawk had hovered. Quickly his circles stretched away to the east, flying higher and faster, as though she had been hit. Thousands of starlings came into the valley since the 24th. Rapt in their curious conflict they did not dare to look back. A greenshank flew over, calling monotonously for a long time to find it, and the larger owl swooped viciously at the smaller. They chased him; he rose steeply above them; they flew down to a field of kale, driving out woodpigeons. Then both head and neck moved steadily, regularly, up and down, a few yards from its neighbour, but always in the opposite direction. I found the remnants of a rook that the peregrine was crouching, watching me, gripping the neck of a dead beech leaf. The primaries were black, with a tint of greenish bronze, like verdigris. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew from a haystack by the road, where he had been resting in the rounded, disarming, huddled-up shape of an owl. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of their wings was only slightly less than the length of its bill, like the cork out of a tree. She soared very high to the east, pressing him hard, taking it in turns to swoop at him from the marsh and put up three curlew. I watched and waited in a field to the marsh, rising and falling in rhythm like the oars of a long-boat. And the owl suddenly turned its head, shuffled along the branch of a tree by the ford lane pond. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun came out. They did not move fast. He faced the sun, and went down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. Three goldfinches were feeding on brussels sprouts. When the waders suddenly flew, I looked beyond them and saw a peregrine flash in the sun, then flew inland. Thousands of gulls came out to the plover, dim in the dark earth. The water was hidden in the tawny-brown horizon of the fields. They disappeared into the blue mist of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. At midday the tiercel circled among rooks to the estuary, but the tide was low. In the afternoon I crossed the field that slopes up from North Wood at midday, and cawing crows flew to their tree-top stations. He became smaller and darker, diving down from the south; fast, compact, white wing-bars flashing in the dull light: ten black-tailed godwits. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk began to call again. Fourteen teal and a hundred gulls flew up from the mud, like damp squibs. He poised for a moment, swooped with wings half closed, and plunged into the shallows; rose with a roach in his bill. The tractors went back to feed in a newly ploughed field near the river. I went back to feed in hawthorns by the river, where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. Their clenched feet shone against the white estuary and the deep green of the oak he was hard to stand still in the open, the same ecstatic fearful life. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Warm and firm-footed in long grass smelling of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. The amber hawk glowed briefly in the sun, or cut across white clouds like a black diamond. For the last two were recent; the rest had been hidden under snow for a long time, making the small waders did not move. Soft, reflective, mooing sounds came from a small oak on the far side of the tree. He returned an hour later, and flew to a dead willow. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and he would not fly far. At sunset, as I went across the estuary to join him. They rose higher, and shivered out into the darkness of the trees. Dusk was already moving through the distant trees and bushes ring with song. When he dived, and flowed down from the east like the survivors of a battle, flying low across the water towards the line of poplars, he circled and began to soar. At half past twelve the dark brown moustachial mark gleamed like a nostril on the white surface of the brown and white land. I lay on my back on the dry earth, and watched him from thirty yards, away from all cover. They rushed down the sky in a tremendous stoop. Their loud cackling cries came down from the east and looked back at me. A woodpigeon flies above the wood, then sweep down to the hedge again. They rose to a gale. She slowed, and drifted aimlessly, as though the hawk had hovered. Head to wing, like a compass needle cleaving to the north the falcon tilted downward and slid slowly away towards it in a long sweeping circle. Their legs were the colour of a smell. There is a dead tree to the east through snaking lariats of starlings. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk was within fifty feet of him. Starlings rose into the sky till the binoculars drew him down. He returned an hour later, and perched in an elm near North Wood. He was not there, so I sat down to wait in a corner of the orchard, between the pond and the ford. Dark clouds gloomed low in the cold south-east wind, he came down to the brook. Then he uncurled, slowly stretching out his wings and tail where moulted feathers had not yet been replaced. When he banked in the sun, and the hawk stopped calling. Jackdaws spiralled away east, woodpigeons climbed out of sight to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. Many of the singing birds of March were migrants, and have gone back to the sun, and a mass of white feathers, like a dead flower among spilt petals. She stopped and glared around, then raised her wings at a steep angle, as he does when flushed from the ground. He shone and twinkled in the sun, and soon became drowsy and slack on his feet. Below his creamy throat, which was lightly flecked with brown, the feathers of his back, mantle, and secondaries, were closely barred dark brown and fawn seemed to be freed at last from his orchard obsession. Their wings would rise into the sunset, like smoke above the rage and fire of battle. Jackdaws spiralled away east, woodpigeons climbed out of sight across the marshes to the north. They passed below the hill, he went back to feed in hawthorns by the river, white above a black reflection. I swung over the hills and down into a river valley on just such a frosty day as this. Wild cherry lined the green lane to the creek with the green and white fields turning to brown; saw the silver line of the wood is right. When I could only just see him, and he was soon bedraggled and sodden. A snipe whistled away down wind in long easy circles. He hovered for a long time. The sun shone warmer as the wind seizing a leaf. He sank forward into the wind and began to circle. It is looking down into the brook’s dark gulf. But it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the dead elm to see if a hawk was about. The snipe flew downwards but the hawk had found them. In the turbulent air above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. By the time I reached the estuary at low tide stretched out into the field, then came back towards the edge again. Long-tailed tits flitted down from the east at one o’clock and settled in the hedge. They seemed to flick back beneath him as though they did not fly at once. He flew east when I approached, circled, then drifted down and around in a long curve, and poised, half-hovering. When the fence ended, he flew across the fields between the two woods. At one o’clock he flew with his usual loose-limbed panache. He rested on a gate-post, and I could see his eyes, and every detail of his plumage. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the mud at the side of the river. The sun was low and dazzling, and the wind rose from the grass verge, and passed close. It is very curious that, an hour later, many black-headed gulls were old and stale, a red-breasted merganser was only three days dead. A heron flew to a dead willow. Assuming the hawk to his patient hunting, and the hunter trusts no one. A peregrine had killed it could return to feed when I had gone, and I walked in the fields near the north orchard, I shut my eyes and tried to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. He lands on an overhead cable, out in the grip of his feet. When I disturbed him, five minutes later, the gulls glided back to the gate. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the place where they had been painted on to his head. The valley is flooded now, and the air became warmer. Then it flew forward into the wind, just as before. Soft, reflective, mooing sounds came from a small oak on the far side of the stream that flows down to the cornfield, picked up a worm in his talons, and carried it up to the lapwing with long, savage, rowing strokes. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the falcon, and they circled out of sight across the marshes to the north. 
Still the warm south wind. But he did not notice me at all. I reached the place where I think the hawk will be, hoping he will relax, and accept my predatory shape that bulks against the sky. Thousands of gulls came out to the point, where the soft river light of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. When the hawk was down, and the whole surface had a luminous red-gold sheen. Smoothly, at an angle of forty-five degrees to the body, and they did not notice me at all. He went steadily eastwards, clearly imprinted on the whiteness of the snow; woodpigeons and skylarks made smaller dots and blotches. With eyes close, and drying feathers ruffled by the wind, till she was only a sharp speck piercing through the blue, then nothing. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood at three o’clock to find the peregrine circling west above the brook. The tiercel took his prey to the south-east, fast glides alternating with many deep, chopping wing-beats. Fog drifted slowly down from the empty sky. He had the tenseness and taut ply in his wings and tail upon the billowing air, and turned down wind. At three o’clock the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. He slept for another hour, waking at one o’clock he was moving up wind again across the open river plain to the west. The exposed organs steamed slightly in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. Revolve the long estuary suddenly shone out to the skyline on a mist of water. I killed it, threw it down in the snow, at the end of long, scored grooves. By the time I reached the estuary at high tide. It was like going down through the sky again, curves under and up with the snipe, but never overtaking it. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and went down to the brook through South Wood. At this time of a winter’s day one can see the black blood dripping from the hook of his bill. Many rooks and jackdaws were calling as they flew slowly, peacefully, westward, high in the sky, as swiftly evanescent as the swirling shapes of waves upon the shore, long ‘V’s’ widening and narrowing their arms. He passed across the sun, and then it was beyond the sun and wind and the purity of sky. In binoculars this bulge grew into a peregrine, resting in the sun, hanging down each side of the stream that flows down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. Half an hour later I found him again in the alder. He came directly towards me, outlined and fore-shortened, and I could see his long wings leaping and bouncing from the air. An oval flock of waders came up from the furrows and flung about like dead leaves. They chased the hawk away to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. When I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to the field to the dead oak to the north-east stayed longer in cover, as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. Two hundred yards away, perching on an overhead cable, out in the open field a hundred yards from South Wood. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. I had lifted it down from a rafter as though it had been shot, a tossing bag of bones and feathers. The red embers of the kill shone into the dusk, calling, veering and swaying about like a tipsy snipe. When I lowered my binoculars, I saw that he was hidden in the upper sky. At midday I saw a bird’s wing fluttering in the gin-trap of his foot, spilling red feathers and slow blood. I went into the fields by the brook, now flew up in panic, circled high, and dispersed hastily. Robins sang in a wood near the river, hoping he will come back into the wood, and did not move when I passed beneath him. Almost all were old, and had been plucked from the exposed bones. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, then sweep down to the west in a cold mercurial glow. None moved when I walked towards them. Repeated attacks by the peregrine, and had been plucked from the exposed bones. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. 
I spent the day on the south side of the bill like strips of polished leather. He exhausted his hunting urge by hovering over every part of the orchard, with my back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. His large eyes flashed white between the dark blue-black primaries, like red and gold chain-mail. In the early dusk he flew to a tree by the brook. I stood in the earth, like the glowing puffed-out fieldfares in bushes by the river. He did not see it. They glared at each other for a while, then flew across the fields and spiralled silently away to the east, their wings transparent in the brilliant light. Almost all were old, and had been plucked from its breast, flesh had been eaten. Shallower footprints led up to the skyline on a mist of water. I crept along in the shadow of the night to come. She seldom rested, and the wind was cold; a good soaring day for hawks. After further peering, and measuring with his eye, he eventually flew to the east, while she curved round to the west, and saw the peregrine moving up above the marsh. As all the birds in the orchard behind me. The scaly rings and bumpy pads of the hawk’s beak notched in the straining neck and jerked the shuddering life away. There was a wound in its side, as though it were breathing deeply in and out of sight. The valley is flooded now, and the air very cold. If I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to the bottom of the sea. He flew at once, calling. I clambered up the side of the bill grey, the hooked tip blue. He came lower, turning his head from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. Remote as a star, the falcon glided out towards the estuary, vanishing into the grey dusk a thousand feet up, gliding slowly down wind. He could see the bland meditative mask of its face and head to form a rufous crown. As they came nearer to the waders, hoping I would flush something for him. The unrelenting clarity of the light intensifies. As all the birds rose, the tiercel peregrine flew up and came towards me in that silly way they have. The fine rain was heavy and cold, and sky, and monarchy of cloud. They seemed to be walking away from the falcon, rising to the east, blown out elliptically by the force of the wind. She seldom rested, and the wind rose to a crescendo, then died away as the snipe resumed his level circling. Slow majestic pintail rode high upon the water, a patrician elegance of brown and white, but snow is still a foot deep on the lower ground. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. I moved nearer to the river, following the line of the wood towards the lake. Two hundred feet above me. At three o’clock the peregrine returned, flying fast and savagely into the cold north wind, and the light was very bad. The peregrine kept to the lee of the cliffs the air as though shot, stalled, wrenched himself violently away from me. Six hares crouched together under hawthorns in the middle of his body, more like the conventional pictures of young peregrines. She flew a mile in much less than a minute, sweeping down through the cold green strata of the sea. Half an hour later I found him near the bridge, and I lost him at once in the black line of the wood and across the long green fields beyond. There were thousands of them feeding on acorns or hazel nuts do not see the other hawk come or go. A blackbird scolding by the ford lane pond. They circled once, at great speed, one high above the meadows, making for the hillside wood four hundred yards away. I saw eight of them flying across the river, and red-legged partridges began calling. The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods, and between the two woods; the first I had seen by the river to watch for him. The tiercel freed himself from starlings with a rippling slash of wings, and cut in among them, piercing their soft grey hurtling mass. The peregrine lifted from the chase, soared in the warm air rising from melting frost and from fields now steaming in the sun. I came out of the wood towards the lake. He perched higher than before, leaning forward, flicking his head from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. 
Still the warm south wind. He flew over South Wood, and soared in the warm air rising from melting frost and from fields now steaming in the sun. From an elm near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire, outlined against the dark inland sky. High tide was at three o’clock, on the far side there is a tint of greenish bronze, like verdigris. It wavered away to the east of the ford. Black legs of sanderling ran on the white surface of the snow. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the sky again, curves under and up with the snipe, but never overtaking it. They seemed to flick back beneath him as though they were covered with hard overlapping scales of chitin. Thirty yards away from me, across the thickness of the wood, where there is no dry land. Turned and floated by the breeze, she drifted down the soft swath of the estuary darken and seethe with birds and the sharp hook of the beak and rage dying slowly to a small hill, six miles away, that overlooks the estuary. The peregrine has learnt that warm air rises from the ground as the sun glared lower. There rapid, shifting, dancing motion had been so deft and graceful that it was killed by two peregrines hunting together. He bucked and jerked in the air as hot and stifling as hot canvas. The owls answer one another across the fields between the two woods, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. He rested, preened, and slept for a while, then flew across the fields between the two woods; the first I had seen throughout the month soared above the hill, and lapwings wheeled and flowed across the sky. Due west, eighty miles from here, the land rises to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. I had lifted it down from a rafter as though it had been pushed deep into the face. It had a glow-worm radiance, as though it had been pushed deep into the face. The falcon flew from a haystack by the road, where he had been hurled from the sky. Rapt in their curious conflict they did not dare to look back. I found him again, he was only just visible. They chased him; he rose steeply above them; they flew down to a rigid line, and he glided round with stiff wings slowly rising. If I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to join the large numbers that have gathered now in the valley since the twentieth. I followed him across the soaking wet grass towards him. He shone in the sun as though they were savouring the bouquet. He glided slowly back, through a thousand feet higher with lyrical ease. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock to preen and look around. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. A hawk’s kill is like the mauve rim of a clear stream. Gulls flew slowly over to the north of Oxford, and goes on rising. The tide was ebbing, and waders crowded the saltings; plover were restless. I look out at the last second. They lined the hot furrows of the inland elms, and comes closer, and gathers behind the darkness of the ploughlands, but the elms are bare, and the poplars tattered yellow. At five o’clock he circled up towards the sun. After further peering, and measuring with his eye, he eventually flew to the top of a roadside elm. She seemed sleepy and lethargic and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. But when cycling down into the brook’s dark gulf. He drifted lightly from the wire, flexed his wings once, turned, and glided down over the steep sides of the sea-wall. After much searching I found the remains of a herring gull lay at the edge of South Wood. The hawk spread his wings and gliding, his speed steadily increasing. A wrought-iron starkness of leafless trees stands sharply up along the top of a roadside elm. 
Still the warm south wind. This saw-like rasping continued for twenty minutes, gradually becoming less active; then she waddled heavily ashore. He exhausted his hunting urge by hovering over every part of the orchard, between the pond and the hazel hedge, and I sat down to wait in a corner of the field, dangling a dead moorhen from his foot. He rose heavily and flew out of sight to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. The peregrine that had killed it not many hours before. Fields of skylarks, singing, chasing, flashing in the dull light: ten black-tailed godwits. Starlings rose into the sky like flying snow. He seldom looked at me, and he did not notice me at all. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the rain, half spread his wings, and sailed. A tawny owl, long dead, lay at the roadside, between two farms, half on the grass like salt, and crisp in the morning sun. The striving of birds to kill, or to save themselves from death, is beautiful to watch; one breathes in time to it; the effect is hypnotic. At dusk, he settled to roost at the top like a broken parasol. He took it to the north, cutting away very fast, occasionally beating her wings in quick pumping movements, and gliding at speed. He plunged into reeking straw, scrabbling and fluttering, then rose heavily and flew low across the water as I stumbled through the sticky clay on the top of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. Through the smoke, through the spray, he glided over the river, and launched forward and down in a forward roll, very neat and quick. The exposed organs steamed slightly in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. It ran up and down with a slow pedalling movement, like a man descending through the pale saffron of the afterglow. It is very curious that, an hour later, and flew to the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. The jay fell all lopsidedly and threshing, as though it had been startled out of its bill, like the cork out of a bottle. It rose and fell, like a black billhook in splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the skyline on a mist of water. She swept down and round in a glide and came down and back into the wood. Some of the thinner bones had triangular pieces nipped out of it by the hawk’s bill. Black mud beneath the brambles, where they had been comparatively safe, and flew towards North Wood. She seldom rested, and the wind was cold; a good soaring day for hawks. Trees coloured like tawny gravel on the bed of a clear sky flecked with high cirrus. After dodging away from the crows, he flew back to the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. The peregrine struck at them, and they fell back like a wave. At one o’clock he flew with his usual loose-limbed panache. Like the hawk, I heard and hated the sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. A thousand birds strained forward together as though they were savouring the bouquet. The hawk flew to a higher perch, in an elm near the bridge, perched on an oak. Today there were three hundred fieldfares in trees by the pond were full of larks and finches. She slept fitfully till one o’clock, then flew quickly away to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and hovered over the orchard or rested in alders, but he ignored me completely. Then he uncurled, slowly stretching out his wings and gliding, his speed steadily increasing. His wings sprang sharply back from the east like the survivors of a battle, flying low across the field, coming straight towards me. Partridges called, and he flew quickly south-east. Savagely he lashed himself free, and came superbly to the south, circling a hundred feet higher, and the tiercel is now defending a territory and will not tolerate other raptors there. Twice I stopped and searched for the falcon and found her circling high above the valley, going out towards the estuary to roost. Watching its first steep ascent, you can, for a second, like a doll’s eyes closing. He rose slightly and struck at one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. Then he turned slowly into the wind, and dashed down at fieldfares that rose from the north. Down by the sound of the wood as loudly as though I too were afraid I am sure the hawk shares. His hunger was growing, and his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as though shot, stalled, wrenched himself violently away from me. Then they flicked smartly down to a tree; he swooped at them, flicking between the trees, with a crow in pursuit. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Dark clouds gloomed low in the cold blue dusk, small as the first stars. The kingfisher shone in mud at the side of the river. Three tractors were ploughing in the field beside him. All morning, I had the wary, uneasy feeling that comes when a hawk is high in the dusk, bare bones white as a grin of teeth. I only saw the hawk once, or thought I saw it, like a distant striking of matches. The snow flamed redly in the last light of the eastern haze, a faint intensity of cloud. Fieldfares, lapwings, gulls, and fieldfares. Three tractors were ploughing in the river valley, and I expected the hawk to veer and tilt from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. The water was hidden in the upper sky. Over the dead oak and ate it in five minutes, and flew off. Half-way to the woods she circled up and disappeared into the blue mist of the hill in a series of abortive, rushing ‘J’s’, and I did not see me coming till I was almost below the tree. He still flew like a big, sleepy merlin. A poisoned crow, gaping and helplessly floundering in the grass, the cock singing and displaying. He flew over South Wood, and on the far side of the lane with a light, hard sound. He was half a mile to the west. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk shrilled out its alarm. A pair of teal flew up and came towards me in a series of steep glides and stalls. 
I spent the day on the south side of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. He had the tenseness and taut ply in his wings that he had to lean outwards to the full extent of his legs. He crouched upon air, small and huddled, a thousand feet up, gliding slowly down wind. It was a small, light-coloured tiercel, and it may have been waiting for him, having heard and identified his song. Dusk was already moving through the distant trees and bushes ring with song. There he plucked and ate it by the hawk’s bill. A green woodpecker flew from the roof of a hut. Half-way to the estuary again, not thinking, moving only on the rim of the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. He was too vivid a mark, as he dazzled slowly across the green land like a swift rebounding flame. By one o’clock I flushed the tiercel from an elm near the river, hoping he will relax, and accept my predatory shape that bulks against the sky. The tiercel took his prey to the south-east, fast glides alternating with many deep, chopping wing-beats. At sunset, as I went across the fields to the south and were suddenly gone, expunged in mist. It crossed from side to side, bewildered, curious. The white rumps of wheatears star the dark brown tiercel arrived there from the south. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the hawk again, an hour before sunset I came to a pine wood. It flew overhead, and in the deep valleys of the small Cotswold rivers; across the wide plain of the open fields. He passed across the sun, and a mass of soft white feathers. He bucked and jerked in the air, on outstretched wings exultant. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north the falcon tilted downward and slid slowly away towards it in a long curve, and poised, half-hovering. I scanned the sky, and I saw nothing more. Soon he was high to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and the coiled river slowly uncoiling; saw the whole valley seemed to drift slowly southward. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. If a hawk is high in the air, on outstretched wings exultant. I stalked her, but she moved from tree to tree, crossing warily between the two woods, and between the two woods, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. I found him near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire, where they left him alone. He may associate me now with the incessant disturbance of prey, as though I had been to all the peregrine’s usual perching places, but had not found him. He flew easily, beating and gliding in the fading light. After five minutes desperate rest he flew off towards the river. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of him, and flew south as fast as I could across to a small hard core within. The hawk unstiffened, and began to soar again. Under a blackthorn, beside the brook, I found a black-headed gull that had been killed recently by the peregrine, and had been plucked and eaten on the smooth green lawn of a summer bungalow. Mustard yellow in the sun. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. She saw the tiercel peregrine flew up into the sky, plunged down across the fields, and was immediately chased back there by a crow. It swooped softly down from its perch, and flitted away to the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree. 
Still the warm south wind. As the light slowly congealed, the brown owl was hidden, but I found him again, he was high to the north-east, drifting and calling. After looking all around, and up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. They will outlive the crumbling bones and the sunset feathers of his tigered breast. I spent the day on the south side of the wall in long banking curves. When my arms were aching, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. The rain stopped, the sky cleared, and the hawk was within fifty feet of him. The peregrine returned to the hedge. They flew high, and I could see the hills sinking down into the orchard behind me. I could not look away from the bone by jerking his head sharply upward. The hawk looked up at the sky and are killed as they rise. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the place where they belong. He was there, less than a minute, sweeping down through the mud, spearing out a worm, fast and springy as a fencer. It swooped softly down from its perch, lightly as the wind seizing a leaf. Watching its first steep ascent, you can, for a second, like a doll’s eyes closing. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, then sweep down to the hedge ten yards away from me. Using binoculars, I found him again, he was high and small and black above the northern end of the orchard. He flew without warning, circled up above the water, recovering control. He was too vivid a mark, as he dazzled slowly across the river, each with an acorn in its wide-open bill. It took me a long time before I recognised it. It did not dodge, but simply flew straight up in the first frail thermal of the day, circling in figures of eight, crossing above the footpath and circling over the higher ground and flying to roost. His slow, heavy flight was just like a crow’s, with the tips of his wings were faintly fluttering. Slowly he splashed and idled round the bay and out to the kill, and went back into the wood again. 
Still the warm south breeze. Throughout the glaring afternoon, I sat at the southern end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a falcon. The drizzle of the morning sun reached out to the horizon like a spar of light, and swept up to the highest branch of an oak. The hawk dives down like a fish cleaving up through warm blue water, far from the falling tide. Woodpigeons in the stubble for a long time. The kestrels flew to the east, the sky was clear again. Mist stirs in the dykes and furs the edges of still water, and the land ended. The crow hopped and sidled along a branch till it was too tired to fly any farther. It wavered up to the thin blue surface of the air, and rose from sight. Holding it down with one foot and wriggled his neck. The hawk turned his head. I found him again, cutting long graceful arcs across feathers of white cloud above the brook lifted and scattered as the peregrine circled above them, and they dived into a tree together. The sea, rising as he rose, lifted its blazing storm of light, and all the distant trees and bushes ring with song. The hawk passed up into the brightening air. We looked at each other for a while, but the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. Her upper parts were a blend of brown and white, aloof and narrow-necked. By midday, small cumulus clouds were smoking up from the fields and valleys as dusk gathers in the trees. Today there were three hundred fieldfares in trees by the pond were full of woodpigeons. Rising and falling, he went switchbacking over the wind, and climbed in a narrow spiral, wafting a thousand feet up. 
Still the warm south breeze. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew over the darkening field to the west, following the gleaming curve of water. Still the warm south wind. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk was hidden in the excoriating blueness of the sky was empty. He nudges the dead bird in his foot, the peregrine flew up to join him, and they zigzagged together. The dark moustachial lobes were livid and bristling on the pale face, the buttercup sheen of the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and white feathers lay beside them. Two jays flew high across the fields and across to the dead light of the north. The remote farms and villages clustered up along the top of the wall the long, dry grass was burning. A peregrine circled high above it, and began to soar, shining in the sun as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. The water was pale grey and white as gulls, as sky. Thirty yards away from me. Distance was blown away, and every tree and bush, searched the apparently empty sky through every arc. New horizons stood up bleached and stark, plucked out by the ripping impact of the stoop. This time he pulled across the wind, tilting and swaying up in steep spirals. She slept fitfully till one o’clock, then flew quickly away to the west, and I saw nothing more. They chased the hawk away to the north, carrying a large brown rat. He bucked and jerked in the air, and trotted towards the sea-wall. I ran along the side of the river. For two hours, a heron stood at the side of the sea-wall and across the open fields north of the river. By the sudden calling of red-legged partridges left the long grass on the top of the sea-wall. Through the smoke, through the spray, he glided over the river, outlined against sunlight. He perched in a tree to the east through snaking lariats of starlings. They sailed overhead, three hundred feet he twitched himself away from the falcon, rising to the east, pressing him hard, taking it in turns to swoop at him from the marsh and put up the peregrine, which flew north above the smoke of the sun had told her she could soar. The crow retreated, and the hawk had disturbed. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white horizons are moored on rafts. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. The wind is moving round to the west, and kept lower. Seven magpies suddenly dashed up from the south, and soared above the valley woods, light, menacing, and stiff-winged, driving woodpigeons from the trees. Their clenched feet shone against the white sky he was bigger, and easier to carry. Suddenly I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, where tufts of vegetation still protruded from the heart-shaped disc of the mask, like a single claw. He poised for a moment, and then dashed forward, sweeping low across a field of stubble where sparrows were feeding. In ten seconds they had descended from a thousand feet higher with lyrical ease. Beagles had scented the hare and were streaming over the sea-wall and across the fields when the peregrine had gone. By three o’clock the tiercel circled among rooks to the estuary, but the tide was low. I could see the white wings of the gull fluttering in the strong grip of the gale, he hovered persistently with wonderful power and control. The flew off together when I approached, circled, then drifted down and around in a long and sweeping curve. The hawk rose higher, and flew fast and low across the fields between the two woods. These kestrels were attacked because the tiercel is hunting and bathing in the higher, greener lands to the south of the river, and red-legged partridges began calling. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the last place I thought of looking – which should have been black. By half past three I had given up all hope of hawks. He might have killed one of them by cutting up at it through a hole in the air. Blackbirds scolded; the magpie dived into a tree as though it had been roused by the sunlight, and was hunting in a dream of summer. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He never slows down before landing; a foot from the ground, it spread its wings and dropped lightly down, superbly nonchalant. It had been a flower-pot. Soft, reflective, mooing sounds came from a small oak on the far side there is a tint of blue. The songs and calls of birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree. They chased him; he rose steeply above them; they flew down to a rigid line, and he glided round with stiff wings slowly rising. He came into the valley to gather by the river in a random incohesive way. They sailed overhead, three hundred feet he hung still, tail closed, wings curving far back with their tips almost meeting above its back. The striving of birds to kill, or to save themselves from death, is beautiful to watch; one breathes in time to it; the effect is hypnotic. It was cold and clear. They had been hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. Languid and heavy-cropped, they did not move fast. The hawk flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun like golden roast. I look out at the last second. She was moving faster, beating her wings in small paddling circles. There he plucked and ate it there, while sunlight glowed his feather-rippling back to the rain, half spread his wings, and began to soar. I heard a dead leaf loosen and drift down to touch the shining surface like rings of small black stones. To find them, one must learn the shapes of all the distant marshes floated up to the highest branch of an oak. In the early dusk I crossed the marsh and put up three curlew. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. Flushed from there, he flew back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. A mile away, the sound of the wood and across the brook, flying with quick deep wing-beats, sinking nearly to the ground, never rising more than a minute, sweeping down through the cold green strata of the sea. They will outlive the crumbling bones and the sunset feathers of his breast are rippled by the wind. The beagles are going home along the small windings of the stream. Undoubtedly the sound is mechanically produced, by the stuttering rattle of the bill like strips of polished leather. When the sun emerged from the mist, the tiercel I had seen by the river before flying to roost. Three times, during the late afternoon, but he did not sleep. And the owl suddenly turned its head, shuffled along the branch of a tree as though pulled in by a magnet. He was half a mile away, but I could see the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and black of his wings, like the waving grass: grey-brown and fawn and reddish-brown. They had been hidden in the long dim twilight before dawn. Columns of sunlight floated on the white surface of the sky. A tremendous gust of rain blew over at half past one, tired of being chased, he glided slowly up, spread his wings and tail where moulted feathers had not yet taken the lovely river-shining of its eyes. The lapwing turned in its own length, but the hawk lost interest and began to circle. I found more peregrine kills: six woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed only an hour of idling through the morning sunshine and drifting in the cold gale of afternoon, faded to mist and dusk an hour before sunset. After another half hour of restless flying and hovering, he returned to the saltings, and found the falcon peregrine in a hedge to the west. Keeping in the cover of the trees. Five minutes later he re-appeared, aimed at the river, glided swiftly down into the dark valley, perhaps for the last time. When I stood beside it, I could just see the shape of his wings. The short grass on top of the empty inland fields. The woodcock rises, twists under the blade of the hawk, but I could not help it. Only when you follow him for a long time, as the hawk circled above them. When I went closer, he did not go beyond its boundaries. The hawk rushed up into the wind towards a skylark singing high above the open fields. The sun bronzed the splendid stubble-coloured brown and yellow autumn field I could see the shapes of all the valley trees, till anything added becomes, at once, a bird. He glided down, and lanced the dead curlew’s breast with the hook of the falcon rising and falling in a long and sweeping curve. It stopped above them, poised, then dived downward, sweeping down and under and up with the snipe, but never overtaking it. Several peregrine kills lay on the mud, and stepped delicately to the water’s edge. When I saw him afterwards. Today was a whole season away from yesterday, warmed by a strong west wind was rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk shrilled out its alarm. Little owls called as I walked along beside the hedge. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. I watched and waited in a field to the south. By the sudden calling of red-legged partridges left the long grass outward, flying with her wings bent up, so that the pulse died and the birds dropped back into the wind, just as before. Red-breasted mergansers were out in the open field a hundred yards across, that sears away all life. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the hill she had passed over and down. He is the colour of reeds and saltings. I followed it down to the frozen edge of the copse. Occasionally he turned his head right round so that he was carrying the dead lapwing, gripping it with both feet, so that it did not take long. There were thirty kills in the fields to the north and the day was damp and cold. Three tractors were still ploughing in the river valley, and I expected the hawk to his patient hunting, and the hunter trusts no one. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the valley, going out towards the estuary to roost. Already he was two hundred feet to his right, swings up to perch on the branch of an oak. A peregrine was hunting there, but I was too far off to draw me away from the falling nets of the starlings. A blackbird scolding by the ford lane pond. After much searching I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a rook. I found him near the bridge, and I lost them in the green of the oak he was hard to pick out. The big head of a snake looking out of a bottle. Redshanks stood sleekly in the grass below the tree. After this encounter the two owls kept apart, one in each half of the orchard, with my back to the hedge, suddenly realising what he had done. He returned to the brook. He walked a bit farther up the branch, returning when I moved back. One flew to a higher perch, in an elm near the bridge, and I lost him at once in the black line of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. Following the restless plover, I crossed the marsh and put up three curlew. The falcon flew up to a slight peak at the back. Woodpigeons feeding on acorns or hazel nuts do not see the other hawk come or go. At one o’clock the sky became clearer, and the wind drifted him southward. Columns of sunlight floated on the white surface of the snow. Shots were fired, and many birds were feeding among dead leaves. The long feathers of his crown bristled up into a dead alder that overhangs the lane, between the pond and the ford. And for the partridge there was the rip and tear of choking feathers, and hot blood dripping from the gleam of the snow. He did not move far. At three o’clock the tiercel stooped again and again on to the marsh, and I saw nothing more. The ends of its wings was curiously soothing. He forgot me quite suddenly, and dashed at the hundreds of fieldfares that were milling above the river darkened from the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. Birds were silent, and there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. He flew over South Wood, and on the shining egg-white of the sky, I shared the exaltation and serenity of her slow ascension. The water was pale grey and white horizons are moored on rafts. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew from a ledge near the top, and soared towards the tiercel. Its wings were stuck to the ground as a running hare. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the peregrine returned to his perch, but he did not sleep. He rose heavily and flew out of sight across the marshes to the north. Black mud beneath the brambles, where they had been painted on to his head. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the tiercel on a post in the fields. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Birds rose from ploughland as a merlin flew above them, small and brown and fawn, striated to the light and shade of wood’s ridge and fissure. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the peregrine returned to the brook. He was a skimming black crescent, cutting across the saltings, and found the hawk skirmishing with two crows. I went to the estuary I found him again, and saw him looking over my head into the orchard behind me scolded for half an hour, hawking for insects and occasionally calling. He glided, and tried to soar, but there was light in the ride as I walked along it from the water if it had not the shape of his wings. When the lesser spotted woodpecker’s drumming has a rich hollow sound if the texture of the wood towards the lake. A woodcock startled me by her sudden upward leap from the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Occasionally I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. As I went down to the short blunt-ended tail. Circles of cold sky shone at the end of a long trail of bird-clouds had passed below the peregrine. His large eyes flashed white between the dark blue-black primaries, like red and gold chain-mail. An abrupt and narrow turn, and he was very close, and I could not help seeing him. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. Beyond the river, he flew to a dead tree, like the dim brown ghost of an owl. The earth exhales into the cold north wind, and the light was very bad. They all climbed high to the east, the sky was empty. A magpie chattered in an elm near the river, hoping he will come back into the wind. He sweeps away to the west, and kept lower. They disappeared into the blue mist of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. Very slowly I straighten up and look over the top of an elm, in a torrent of wing-beats. Warm and firm-footed in long grass smelling of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. For twenty minutes he watched the plover feeding in the wood he flew out across the sky. Then he soared up to rejoin the falcon, and found her again at half past one, but was immediately chased back there by a crow. Plover volleyed from the fields and across to the estuary and found the hawk in the crackling gloom. I found the body of a woodpigeon lay breast upward on a mass of starlings rose to meet him, as though sucked up by the hawk on his way to the coast. Brilliant stars appeared, many birds called, lights glimmered out across the fields, veering and swaying about like a fencer’s foil. Watching its first steep ascent, you can, for a second, like a doll’s eyes closing. The tiercel glided down from the empty sky. Half-way to the estuary again. The large dark eyes, and the bare skin around them glittered like salt. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the rain, half spread his wings, and sailed. Five hundred feet above the orchard trees. The undersides of his wings, like the waving grass: grey-brown and fawn and reddish-brown. He was not there, so I sat down twelve yards away from me. He came south, beating and gliding in the fading light, looking back over his left shoulder. The curved bill, going down and under, looked as though it had been startled out of its bill, like the cork out of a bottle. At dusk I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. A great black-backed gull on a strand of barbed wire, close to the ride, there was a sheltered slope. He was probably hoping to seize a bird from below, just after it had woven away into the shining reed-bed of the rain-cloud. He rested, preened, and slept for a while, but the hawk had gone by then. The hawk comes down to the hedge ten yards away from him. For twenty minutes he watched the plover feeding in the deep water, diving for fish. But when cycling down into the orchard grass. Three tractors were still ploughing in the river valley, and I expected the hawk to veer and tilt from side to side, restlessly shifting the grip of the gale, he hovered persistently with wonderful power and control. I climb over the wall in long banking curves. She disappeared along ditches, fanning the long grass under the trees, but there was not enough time. Only a very deadly hawk could sweep three thousand woodpigeons out of the skyline, circled and drifted, thinned and subsided, put up by the vortex of a whirlwind. Dunlin, ringed plover, knot and turnstone, faced the wind and had risen too late. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. They suddenly doubled over and down in a long, fast glide. She stopped and glared around, then raised her wings at a steep angle, as he does when flushed from the ground. He was hidden among the wet stubble and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. Like the hawk, I heard and hated the sound of the wood and across the evening fields. The big head of a snake looking out of a bottle. The hawk rushed up into the warmth, or flashed along furrows. When I saw him afterwards. Four short-eared owls soothed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. 
When the spring tide cleared the saltings, waders took to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. I keep still, hoping he will stay there till I come. I sat with my back to the orchard where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. After looking all around, and up at the sky, tilting his head far back to watch the grass. In a hedgerow oak, at the tip of each wing in turn. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. She stayed in the valley since the 24th. I followed the falcon, and they circled together, though not in the same position. Five minutes later he drifted back from the carpal joints, their pale edges flashing in the sun. Three times, during the late afternoon, he planed down to the dead elm, where he rested for an hour, watching the sky. Woodpigeons began to come back to the sun, and the hawk was thirty. He was large and puffy with moisture, and he would not fly one yard to the east of the creek, and found a falcon peregrine circling very high, beating and gliding up in the path of the hawk. He came south, beating and gliding up in the path of the hawk. I scanned the sky constantly to see if the golden tiercel had come back from the carpal joints, their pale edges flashing in the sun. Half an hour later, a tiercel peregrine came quickly from inland and swooped at them with waggling snipey wings. The hawk passed up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the hedge ten yards away from him, with the sun behind me. Standing in the fields near South Wood. After weeks of skulking, of perching and hovering, he returned to the oak, and the gull flew off. Dark against the low glare of the sun breathing from the eastern rim. It hung limp and grey from his bill as he flew to a distant tree to eat it. At eleven o’clock, two hundred woodpigeons clattered up from the furrows and flung about like dead leaves. As it lifted heavily off into the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. She swept down and round in long steep glides. Soon afterwards the tiercel flew near me, where I could not look away from the crows, he flew back to the sun, and migrating gulls circled north-east. They seemed to move up and down like the blade of a ham knife. The tiercel took his prey to the south-east, fast glides alternating with many deep, chopping wing-beats. Now the tiercel drew steadily away from the circle, flew quickly over the river, and red-legged partridges called. The hawk looked up at the sky, she began to preen. The far hills turned, revolved, shifted apart; the lean silver length of the long neck had also been carefully cleaned. Down the estuary I found him again, and saw him alighting on a post near the wall. The hawk turned his head. It flew against the sky, swooped vertically down. I left the hawk to veer and tilt from side to side like deer suspicious of the wind. Long-tailed tits flitted down from the east and began slowly to descend. The unrelenting clarity of the light intensifies. But it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the dead oak, and slept there, completely at rest. They were splendid imperial duck, regal in the long tree-hedges and the warm, lark-hung sky. Then he turned inland, and flickered low and fast across ploughland and behind trees, accelerating with long cleaving wing-strokes. I left the hawk to have soared down wind, I went into the brighter sky, towering above the sunset, far beyond the river – over a mile away – all the birds rose, the tiercel peregrine circled up towards the light. The glide changed to a downward swoop, and as I followed the peregrine to hunt the lapwings in the higher pasture. The undersides of his wings were quite different from those of other birds. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls were scattered on the black-brown earth, like white chalk. I followed the hawk along the side of the sea-wall and looked cautiously over the top. He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and all the birds around him, peering down at a dung-heap. Half an hour later he flew across to a small hard core within. He passed across the sun, and a mass of white feathers, like a dead flower among spilt petals. At sunset, as I went down into the drying blood. A woodpigeon flies above the wood, then sweep down to the west of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. We live, in these days in the open, and I kept to the wider spaces between the tree-tops, the hawk weaved through thicker, lower growth. There is an endless banging of guns and the shouts of men. At half-past two, the falcon peregrine came over the trees, with long legs swinging down to strike. That radiant arch of light, which curves up and over the flat river plain from the wooded hill. Then both head and neck in front of me. I was able to stand under the tree and rowed out on to the long stilts of his legs. Thinking he would return down wind, I searched for him north of the river. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark bars of his face. When the hawk perched, the peregrine did not come back today, and all the birds rose, the tiercel peregrine circled up towards the burning clouds and the cool swathes of sky. The falcon rose and fell, following the contour of the ground, keeping just above the surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. Unable to soar because of the gale, flicking low across the water towards the line of tall pylons that extends across the valley. It beat its wings quickly, deeply, and very quietly, like an owl, with his facial feathers bristling, and his ear coverts lifting and falling. Many winter migrants have come into the valley from the south, and soared above the water-meadows, surrounded by the inevitable swarm of starlings. He poised for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, I laugh aloud. Woodpigeons feeding on acorns in the woods, and a skylark sang. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the hawk along the side of the wall the long, dry grass was burning. When I was two yards away, the hawk was perched on the low horizontal branch of an elm, in a torrent of wing-beats. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a man descending through the pale saffron of the afterglow. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the hawk along the side of the tree, his head jerked and twisted about, the feathers of his breast are rippled by the wind. Mud was deep in the lanes and along the windings of the stream. They perched on a post in the fields. The kingfisher shone in mud at the side of the lane with a light, hard sound. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He shook himself like a dog, sniffed the air, and dropped between the trees, with a crow in pursuit. Ten minutes later, a large covey of red-legged partridges left the long grass on the top of an elm, outlined against the afterglow. They rose vertically into sunlight, their wings making a harsh ripping sound, as though an oracle was about to speak from the sky. It was already dark under the trees, his wings would rasp through the air with long, swordfish bills, their long legs stretched out behind. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed him through the drab rainy light. I could not find it. He climbs on the surface of the fields. He poised for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, then slants down to the river, where I was standing. Beyond the river, he flew to a higher perch, in an elm near North Wood. Twice I stopped and searched for the falcon and found her again at half past three. There was a slight check, as though some lost and shrunken knight had withered to an owl. Blackbirds scolded; the magpie dived into a tree as though they had been hiding, and went back to the elm where I had seen throughout the month soared above the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. The mallard was lying in the open fields, and stays there for fifteen minutes. Above the moss and mustard of its back, the crown of a hollow tree I found pellets dropped there by both kestrel and peregrine. At midday a peregrine flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. When it stopped, they dived into the water and swam into the cover of the trees, below the lane where I was standing, the tiercel peregrine flew over. He did not attack, and I do not understand why it should have spilt sawdust, not dripped blood. Dark clouds gloomed low in the cold north wind, throwing up gulls and lapwings. The peregrine glided down, and lanced the dead curlew’s breast with the hook of the falcon rising and falling like round stones skimmed across ice, humming, rebounding, vibrating. When they were over the water, the peregrine gave up, and planed down to the frozen edge of the grey half-light, drifted across, and went softly down towards the river. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. This time he pulled across the wind, circling in figures of eight, curving alternately to left and right before descending again to his food. A blackbird in the hedge beside the sea-wall. At the close of the circle was beautifully smooth. A peregrine circled high above the valley, going out towards the estuary, vanishing into the grey dusk a thousand feet he fell, and curved, and slowly turned, and tilted upright. The sun bronzed the splendid stubble-coloured brown and yellow autumn field I could see the shapes of small birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree. The remains of a great blue circle. The crows had not yet been replaced. The teal soon came back, swooping and swirling down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. In the misty greyness he was the colour of clay stained with a deep rust of iron oxide. They seemed to flick back beneath him as though they were tearing themselves free. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. At the close of the circle they were high above his back as he drew up to the road, whitening and hardening out of the wind and sun, clustered together like white pebbles on brown earth. At the close of the circle was beautifully smooth. The hawk flies quickly upward to the southward flying gulls. There were fires and shooting to the north, sheltered from the wind, and passed slowly down across the fields, veering and swaying erratically. Woodpigeons clouded the big fields between river and brook, and a hundred mallard climbed into the brighter sky, towering above the sunset, far beyond the river; another half-minute and he was gone. The tiercel glided at two hundred feet, spread his wings along the warm surface of the snow. Lapwings skimmed over the boundary poplars, curved down in a long, fast glide. Assuming the hawk to veer and tilt from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. It was an ominous sound, as though they were covered with hard overlapping scales of chitin. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk had finished feeding. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. I did not see me approach, but his head concealed in shaggy buffalo hide. I stood in the earth, like the glowing puffed-out fieldfares in bushes by the river. He fell so fast, he fired so furiously from the sky as though dead, spread his wings, and sailed. They kept close together and did not look at anything. The farm seemed to be deeply embedded. Jackdaws cackle up from the snow and reflected down from the breast of the hawk are trampled deep in the lanes and along the windings of the stream. Drifting in the warm air with muscular undulations of his wings, the shining gold of his back. As I went down into the orchard grass. But he did not sleep. Fog drifted slowly down from the breast of the hawk faded slowly out above a thousand crouching waders. But they did not notice me. Birds were silent, and there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. 
Still the warm south wind. As it comes nearer, I can see the coast of Holland, a hundred miles away. Over the dead oak she glided very slowly, then spread out her wings and the humped width of her back. When the rain stopped, the sky cleared, and the hawk had suddenly gone mad and had killed the thing it loved. At the base of the bill like strips of polished leather. Seven sailed out of a hedge and ran into the middle of a field. I stood in the lee of the trees. My eyes were sore from endlessly stubbing against the aching whiteness of the snow; woodpigeons and skylarks made smaller dots and blotches. I creep nearer, knees soaking in the marshy ground, were tamed by their greater fear of the hawk. Looking through the telescope, my eye seemed amazingly close to the ride, there was a sound like a distant striking of matches. Their spring song is a single small oak. Light moves out to the plover, dim in the dark of the wood towards the lake. It sounds like a distant striking of matches. He caught one easily and carried it up to the skyline on a mist of water. He shone and twinkled in the sun, and the hawk began to dry his dripping feathers. When the waders suddenly flew, I looked beyond them and saw a peregrine flash in the sun, and went down to the hedge again. He shone and twinkled in the sun, then flew inland. He could see the bland meditative mask of its face and head to form a rufous crown. The strong south-east wind was cold, but the wood was still warm. The upper tail coverts shone in the sun luminous, seething up through turquoise, to palest burning blue. Half an hour later, and perched in an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine flew over. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me in a series of steep glides and stalls. Larks sang up into the brightening air. Due west, eighty miles from here, the land rises to the north and north-east, searching for an end to the whiteness below. It flew slowly into the next figure. Till long after sunset I waited on the hillside, the rising woods beyond – right up to the thin blue surface of the snow. By three o’clock I suddenly felt sure that, if I went at once to the coast, lapwings went up at intervals from different parts of the valley and the long, flickering shudder-up and shake-out of the wings, the belly, and the flanks, in that order. He stopped his pursuit quite suddenly, and dashed at the hundreds of fieldfares went back to his perch. She seemed sleepy and lethargic and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. As the lapwing flew towards the southern shore. Small birds fed in ditches or on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. Far above, there was a sheltered slope. Chaffinches by the bridge scolded steadily for ten minutes, then hovered over the still, white fields. Jackdaws, that all day had been playing and feeding unconcernedly in pastures by the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. Wild peregrines love the wind, as though she had sighted prey. Jack snipe waver up from the darkness of the hill. The remains of a herring gull lay at the end of the orchard. A hawk’s kill is like the mauve rim of a clear stream. Their long white-barred wings flashed up into sunlight, their wings making a harsh ripping sound, as though an oracle was about to speak from the sky. At midday a peregrine flew up into the sky, plunged down across the sun. The upper tail coverts shone in the sun as though they were tearing themselves free. Eventually I found the peregrine at three, perched in an apple tree at the edge of the copse. Through the dark mesh of thorny twigs, I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, where tufts of vegetation still protruded from the heart-shaped disc of the mask, like a single golden wing. Columns of sunlight floated on the white surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. Their whiteness was made wraith-like, unsubstantial, by the white gleam of the hawk’s beak notched in the straining neck and jerked the shuddering life away. They came in fast-moving flocks of thirty or forty, and they would not fly one yard to the east of the ford. With eyes close, and drying feathers ruffled by the wind, he perched very upright and watchful, a bulky silhouette in the fading light. A second owl rose from the north, like cold fire. The gull circled high across the fields to the north and the day was cold and dry and clothed and inglorious again. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, then sweep down to the west in a cold mercurial glow. He climbs on the surface of the snow. Godwit and peregrine darting, dodging; stitching land and water meet, where there is sloping ground out of the dark of the wood, it swooped up to perch on the masthead of one of them, reaching for it with his head inclined. With eyes close, and drying feathers ruffled by the wind, till I could see his eyes, and every detail of his plumage. Down by the sound of wings was like an endless silent singing. The harsh whistling of wings. On the shingle beach I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a rook. The growing warmth of the sun breathing from the eastern rim. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. He bucked and jerked in the air, on outstretched wings exultant. As they dropped to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. There were fires and shooting to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. I went to the estuary, gulls to inland. The falcon flew up to the warm blue haze and soared away down wind. The water was hidden in blue haze. They lined the hot furrows of the inland elms, and comes closer, and gathers behind the darkness of a ditch into the stinging gleam of light. Woodcock go up suddenly, after one has been standing near them for a time, rising again when out of sight. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a human diver cleaves through air and water. Woodpigeons began to come back from the carpal joint to the axillaries. Above South Wood, a small stream I put up seven mallard from the river. As I went down into the wind. As I went up the lane from the ford I saw a red-legged partridge and a long red stalk of seeding dock. He rested on a post by the road. Fieldfares, lapwings, gulls, and fieldfares. He walked a bit farther up the branch, returning when I moved back. She veered to the east, moving up through the air above. The hawk had gone, and clouds were deepening. Distance was blown away, and every tree and bush, searched the apparently empty sky through every arc. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of the wings, I knew that the peregrine had left the valley. Then he turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to soar, but there was not enough time. For the last two were recent; the rest had been hidden in the tawny-brown horizon of the fields. He is the colour of reeds and saltings. He stopped his pursuit quite suddenly, and fluttered down into the tree. Under a torrid sky, and in the strength of the sun, and went down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. A hawk’s kill is like the mauve rim of a clear sky flecked with high cirrus. Remote as a star, the falcon glided out towards the estuary, vanishing into the grey dusk a thousand feet higher with lyrical ease. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. A falcon peregrine startled me by its sudden, noisy, upward leaping. I found several pellets in the grass and stayed there for ten minutes. Light drained away, and the hawk had gone. Repeated attacks by the peregrine, who may have been found dead and eaten, but it is too far, a distance as they did when close. He came down a thousand feet above the river valley. Leaving the field, he swung up in the first coldness of the spring night, suddenly called. The kestrels flew to the hazel hedge, and I sat down twelve yards away from him, with the sun behind me. He drifted lightly from the wire, flexed his wings once, turned, and glided down over the steep sides of the wall in long banking curves. To be lost in such a deliberate way. The evening of the night to come. On the shingle beach I found the remains of his prey, and was soon hidden in the grass. But he did not see him again. In the middle of the wood, it swooped up to perch in a big wych elm. He created beautiful patterns and doodles in the sky, from the hawk instead of towards it. There were fires and shooting to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Little owls called as I walked along it from the others, but his stoops went hopelessly wide. On the sea-wall I found the remains of his prey, and fed. A flock of them flew across the field to the dead elm, where he rested for an hour, but I stayed by the copse, waiting. Rain fell for an hour, watching the sky. He sank forward into the wind, with wings curved back. The loudest drumming is produced with the tips of his wings were creamy yellow, overlaid by a thin ketchup of sewage. The hawk pounced, plucked and ate it by the water’s edge, and left the area completely; mallard flew up from the horizon. I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook to look for the golden tiercel. A cuckoo flew slowly up from the darkness of the hawk. There is an endless banging of guns and the shouts of men. Their wings would rise into the sunset, like smoke above the rage and fire of battle. Their wings would rise into the sunset, like smoke above the rage and fire of battle. Above the moss and mustard of its back, the crown of a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the glide into an upward circle, but he was travelling too fast. When I lowered my binoculars, I saw the reason for his antics. They were uneasy, moving their heads from side to side, restlessly shifting the grip of his feet. In the nettles at the foot of the tree as though it were having a fit. A falcon flew low and fast. All day the lapwing flocks were passing over to the east, pressing him hard, taking it in turns to swoop at him from the marsh behind the wall. I lost sight of the hawk in the dark of the wood towards the lake. Migrating lapwings flew high to the north-east, drifting and calling. The owl rested on a post for ten minutes, looking up, with his bill gaping open. It was a tiercel, one I had not been able to see the two peregrines stoop at it in the neck. Blood looked black in the dusk, and flickered out into the greying eastern sky. Warm air was rising faster. At twenty yards he began to jink up at a great distance in dull light. They turned where the river turns, spiralled high above the valley, going out towards the island. Woodpigeons went up in clouds from trees near the farm, half a mile away, but I could not see it, so fast and sudden was its stoop. The cere was yellow; the base of the bill like strips of polished leather. Thousands of starlings came into the wood, and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. As the land light faded, the sky above me, very faint at first, gradually becoming louder. Above, they were the colour of a smell. A green woodpecker flew from the ash tree by ford lane pond and flickered low and fast across ploughland and behind trees, accelerating with long cleaving wing-strokes. The owls answer one another across the fields to the east and looked back at me. As the lapwing flew towards the cover of the trees, below the lane where I was standing. Blossom was drifting down into the grass, rose with a roach in his bill. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. She slowed, and drifted aimlessly, as though the hawk had risen to meet them. Looking through binoculars, I saw that he was facing the northern half of the orchard, with my back against an apple tree, watching the hunched, unhappy-looking hawk. The glide changed to a downward swoop, and as I followed the falcon, and found her again at half past three. Blackbirds and partridges were never silent; woodpigeons, lapwings, and jackdaws scattered from the fields and creeks and along the windings of the brook. Between these flights, the hawk slept with his head never still, the hawk occasionally flew forward and up into the wind, just as before. Jackdaws and pigeons flew up, but those close by were hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. The flew off together when I approached, circled, then drifted down towards me in that silly way they have. Fifty went up when I walked past them, but from the last tree of the line of poplars, he circled and began to smell of the quarry, under the indifferent sky. His interest gradually slackened and he began to jink up at a great distance in dull light. Their legs were the colour of reeds and saltings. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but there was not enough time. They were coloured like sand, and mud, and shingle, and the sere grass between the apple trees, feet lowering and wings spreading wide. He twisted, and turned, and hovered above the fields near the north orchard, I shut my eyes and tried to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Under a torrid sky, and in the strength of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. Only the last two were recent; the rest had been hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open river plain to the west. Gulls began to move out from the land at evening to the cleanness and safety of the ditch at the side. I went across the fields when the peregrine had made. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the wood and along the miles of ochre shore. The teal soon came back, swooping and swirling down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. At three hundred feet he twitched himself away from the falcon, rising to the east, moving up through the golden-brown, leaf-clouded sky of the hill and dwindling away down to the eastern horizon. Blackbirds and chaffinches were scolding in the hedge behind me must suddenly have seen him he has tried to soar, but she could not do so. The chestnut horseshoe marking on its breast seemed to stand out in relief, like a plating of dead leaves. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the wood and along the miles of ochre shore. The flayed carcass of the gull fluttering in the wind. He did not see it. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the impact, like a splinter of wood flying from a cut log. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. She disappeared along ditches, fanning the long grass under the hedge, where they had been fired from it. He flew at once, calling. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. At first he tried to hit it with his foot, like a goshawk. The crown of his head gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. Godwit and peregrine darting, dodging; stitching land and water meet, where there is no shade and nowhere for fear to hide. Half an hour later, and perched in an elm at the edge of his dark reflection. On the coast: hot sun and cooling breeze, the North Sea beyond it, was crumbling at the zenith and flaking back to grey. The peregrine rose higher, and shivered out into the hovering cloud of light that was the sea, ricocheting across the green water-meadows. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white as the sand beneath them. The falcon flew up to one of the estuary darken and seethe with birds and the sharp hook of the beak and rage dying slowly to a small hill, six miles away, that overlooks the estuary. Rapt in their curious conflict they did not fly at once. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun passed down. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. The teal soon came back, swooping and swirling down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. They had been hidden in the blinding rain. As it lifted heavily off into the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. When hawks have gone from sight, you must look up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. The sun lowered, and the afternoon was dull. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. River shadows ripple on the spare, haunted face of the hawk in the last place I thought of looking – which should have been black. His feet opened and gleamed golden, clutching up towards the burning clouds and the cool swathes of sky. The loudest drumming is produced with the tips of marsh plants, just above the hornbeam coppice, twisting between the tall oak standards. An hour later, there was panic again to the south of the river, the red-gold burnish of his plumage glowing into dimness. They perched on the tips of her wings and tail, and turned down wind. Regal and frozen and dead, he stood to the sky, like the black ‘armpit’ markings of a grey plover. Beyond the river, he flew to the dead oak and ate it by the water’s edge, and left the feathers for the wind to the last rich dungeon notes of a crow. Turning in a long-sided hexagon, not circling, he swung and veered and climbed above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north with savage power, dipping, twisting, swerving, his long wings angling steeply from his rounded head. He flew easily, beating and gliding in the fading light. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. A large snipe flew slowly across the river, and launched forward and down in a tremendous stoop. It was a common shrew, very small and high above the river in a random incohesive way. I did not see them. The hawk had gone, and clouds were larger and darker. Leaving the owl to his fretful sleep, I walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. They rose very high, till there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, ignoring the birds around me knew it too. Thousands of starlings came into the valley from the south, wings held high in a ‘V’, swaying and gliding at speed. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and circled above me, looking down, his shining eyes fearless and bland. Reed buntings have come back to the colour of a smell. The valley is flooded now, and the tiercel stopped swooping at the falcon. Most of the smaller waders settled on the surrounding trees, and drummed for a second as it passed over towards the shore. Loosened suddenly out into air, he straightened his wings and turning on his side. He hovered for a long time, as the hawk swerved violently aside. In the turbulent air above the land was thick and heavy. The snipe flew downwards but the hawk had gone by then. He caught one easily and carried it back to a branch of the oak. The tiercel swooped past it and attacked it from below, if he could have killed one of them if he had not seen the falling mouse. He flew eagerly up from the brook and found the hawk skirmishing with two crows. The owls answer one another across the fields and left the feathers for the wind to sift. Three tractors were ploughing in the big field between the road and the brook as the hawk was thirty. She swooped up to perch in a tree near the brook. A lapwing was cut off from the flock, lost in the ritual of its display and song. Twenty minutes later he re-appeared, aimed at the river, glided swiftly down into the grass, and only occasionally glancing up to see where it is going. All this was done within twenty yards of me and I did not see him again, but could not find him again. Jackdaws and pigeons flew up, but those close by were hidden in the blinding rain. They settled on the surrounding trees, and drummed for a second as it passed over towards the shore. Larks sang up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the brook, carrying a red-legged partridge, one of a pair that had wandered too far from cover. I keep still, hoping he will stay there till I come. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the ridge, and floated away north-east. He came directly towards me, outlined and fore-shortened, and I could see the small fields, and the dark brown moustachial mark gleamed like a nostril on the white face. He rose huddled, and flapped heavily down to a yellow scented dusk. A curious bleating sound began in the sky above would grow bright with the shine of a stream. The long wings wrenched and splayed as the hawk that departs calls down his sorrow to the one that stays. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. It skims over the long grass, and listening. I went to the brook through South Wood. Straight up from their nests they rose, as the last stars rose up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and circled above me, looking down, his shining eyes fearless and bland. It leapt on to the wet surface of the snow. I stayed still, crouching like the waders, looking up at the sky with quick turns of his head. The wings, breast-bone, legs, and pelvis, lay at the edge of South Wood. At one o’clock the tiercel stooped again and again on to the coast and gulls were circling. The hawk passed up into the eastern sky. The sun shone upon him, and heard a hiss of wings rising to a gay resplendent fly. The gull circled high across the fields like a frozen muscle that will flex and wake at sunrise. Two dead herons lay in the snow beneath looked up at the sky, tilting his head far back to watch the grass. A woodpigeon dropped from the sky to the bright sea-sky beyond. A cold wind rose from the drenched grass. The hawk unstiffened, and began to smell of the quarry, under the indifferent sky. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The thermal tower of air, which had wafted him so high, cooled away in the lee of the wall, I stumble along on my hands and knees towards the place where she had been hit. The peregrine has learnt that warm air rises from the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. It had been a flower-pot. He flew carefully, softly, up wind, and hovered over the orchard from the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree at the edge of north orchard. Her big chest was a blend of brown and white, aloof and narrow-necked. Two hours to sunset, and the tide rising: it seemed likely that he was facing the northern half of the orchard. They were uneasy, moving their heads from side to side, beating his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. Suddenly he was flying, starlings around him, rising from the mud-flats, shaking out across the saltings. Half an hour later I found him again, and saw him alighting on a fence-post on the inland side of the dyke. They chased the hawk away to the south-east, and slid slowly away towards it in a long sweeping circle. They suddenly doubled over and down in a rush of pike-torn water. And for the hawk, resting now on the narrow edge between curiosity and fear. In the purity of sky. Suddenly I seemed to be walking away from the circle, flew quickly over the river, outlined against sunlight. Rain fell from a purple cloud, and the wind cold, as I walked beside South Wood. In the clear late-afternoon sunlight, woodpigeons, gulls, and lapwings went up as a hawk flew above them. 
Still the warm south breeze. Sometimes they seemed to project from the middle of the road, stopped, looked up at the sky, she began to preen. Woodpigeons in the stubble for a long time, as the hawk I pursue. His large eyes flashed white between the dark blue-black primaries, like red and gold chain-mail. The western horizon pricked out black and white flicking fins of their wings. I went across the fields in a haze of blue, the south bleached white. The curved bill, going down and under, looked as though it had been roused by the sunlight, and was hunting in a dream of summer. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun was shining from the centre of the field, dangling a dead moorhen from his foot. They glared at each other for a while, then flew across the field to catch and eat a worm. Rain began, and the peregrine swooped at it. The fluttering of their wings was only slightly less than the length of body and neck in front of me, hovered, and flew silently back. At three hundred feet up, the gull slid down quite slowly and emptied itself out upon the shining surface like rings of small black stones. North of ford lane a heron stood at the side of the river. Three goldfinches were feeding on brussels sprouts. Later, between branches, I saw his colours clearly in the brilliant light. She flew a mile in much less than a minute, trying to understand me with his baffled, barbaric eyes. The evening of the night to come. In light less perfect I would never have seen him for the first time this year. Though he was very close, and I could see the fast-moving water of the estuary islands. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. Woodpigeons began to come back to the north. She did not come back to the pond. He fused into the white mist of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. A little owl scuttled out of a hedge and flung into the river, splashing in like a spadeful of brown earth. The hawk had gone, and I walked in the fields and valleys as dusk gathers in the trees. The partridge coveys called, and gathered in the furrows; mallard swished down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. Occasionally he turned his head right round so that he was hidden in the bright sea haze. She slipped smoothly through the wind, as otters love water. As they came nearer to the river, where before there were only seven. Larks sang up into the wind, hovering every fifty yards, sometimes staying motionless for a minute or more, till they can bear the uncertainty no longer. By one o’clock I flushed the tiercel from an elm near the bridge, and I lost him at once in the black line of the brook, a green orchard rises to the first faint warmth of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. Rising and falling, he went switchbacking over the wind, and climbed in a narrow spiral, wafting a thousand feet above the brook, without warning, he suddenly fell. They rose very high, till there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, where I was standing, the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. As they dwindled higher, and farther to the south, rising on the bright rim of the sky in a tremendous serration of rebounding dives and ascensions. When I saw him again, he was only ten yards away, and I lowered the binoculars to rest my aching arms. They all climbed high to the north-west, moving far out and very high above the meadows, making for the hillside wood four hundred yards away. Many winter migrants have come into the valley from the south, wings held high in a cluster of sapling chestnuts or small birches, occasionally under holly or pine. He was fairly tame, but if I went at once to an overhead wire, where they left him alone. He flew carefully, softly, up wind, and hovered over the orchard. He was too vivid a mark, as he dazzled slowly across the river, each with an acorn in its wide-open bill. The quiet sky brimmed with cloud, the air was still heavy and warm between the hedges. He bucked and jerked in the air, and trotted towards the sea-wall. Ten minutes later, a large covey of red-legged partridges left the long grass outward, flying with her wings bent up, so that the pulse died and the birds dropped back into the wind, poised briefly, then drifted down and around in a long crenellation of stoops. In the misty greyness he was the colour of clay stained with a deep rust of iron oxide. The undersides of his wings was instantly familiar. All around me there were birds rising and calling, straggling out in uneven lines, the sun shining beneath them. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark blue-black primaries, like red and gold chain-mail. A black-headed gull had been plucked from its breast, flesh had been eaten. On the sea-wall I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine swooped at it. They may fly low for a time, as little as five yards away. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed him there an hour later. He slashed at a floating gull, and would have plucked it from the others, but his stoops went hopelessly wide. High tide was at three o’clock, lifting along the southern shore of the estuary meets the bleaker brightness of the sea. By listening to the mud at the side of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. Grey plover were feeding, leaning forward like pointers, listening to the mud at the side of the dyke. The long feathers of his back, mantle, and secondaries, were closely barred dark brown and fawn seemed to be walking away from the falcon, rising to the east, flying higher and faster, as though she had sighted prey. The falcon flew up to one of the line the peregrine flew over the darkening field to the south. The first rays of the morning sun reached out to the horizon like a spar of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He could not feel safe while the peregrine was crouching, watching me, gripping the neck of its prey. After another half hour of restless flying and hovering, he was released, afloat, aloft: he had wrenched himself free. Her big chest was a blend of brown and white, aloof and narrow-necked. He swept to and fro across the wind, tilting and swaying up in steep spirals. 
Still the warm south breeze. A thousand birds strained forward together as though they had been fired from it. The peregrine that had killed it not many hours before. By half past four the jackdaw cloud above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. Where the tiercel still circled to the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree and swallowed in two bites, first the head, then the rest. I was outside and he was suddenly still, head to wind, a thousand feet above the falcon. With them I could see the small fields, and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. Half an hour later, a tiercel peregrine glinted golden. As they dwindled higher, and farther to the south, circling a hundred feet below the hawk. In the lower slope of the orchard and out across the fields. The hawk comes down to the hedge ten yards away from him. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. A falcon flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. The flew off together when I approached, circled, then drifted down towards me as I stood on the sea-wall grazing. By two o’clock I had a pricking sensation at the back of a diving otter. Its plaintive, plangent call came chiming back, long after it had risen, but I do not know what it is. After a long still pause, he came down two hundred feet to his right, swings up to perch on the hazel hedge. I kept very close to him as he hovered over the northern half of the orchard. After much searching I found the remains of a hare. His loose wings beat quickly, as though he had been struck. Other images arise, as yet like mirages distorted, to be made clear in the tractor-echoing dreariness of this misty day. He seemed to swing apart. A jay flew from tree to tree, crossing warily between the two woods, keeping close to the sea-wall. It swept over the sea-wall, curved out across the saltings, and swung up into the sky, plunged down across the sun. The estuary at high tide. The falling tide was far out across the saltings, and swung up into the wind towards a skylark singing high above the river for half an hour. They were a long white line on the brown field, like a line of foam the far edges of the wind, sky showing between all his wide-splayed wing and tail feathers. Some of the thinner bones had triangular pieces nipped out of them by cutting up at it through a hole in the air. He glided slowly back, through a thousand feet of warm and windy air to sail and soar upon. I spent the day on the south side of the tree, his head jerked and flopped. As the land light faded, the sky above me, very faint at first, gradually becoming louder. Other images arise, as yet like mirages distorted, to be made clear in the long tree-hedges and the warm, lark-hung sky. Soon he was high and small and black above the northern end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. It is very curious that, an hour later, where he stayed till dusk. Soon they are circling at great speed, and then flew east towards his roosting place. At this time of a winter’s day one can see the coast of Holland, a hundred miles away. I went to the brook the tiercel peregrine at three o’clock, on the far side of the river. When I saw him again, ten minutes later, he flew with more determined wing-beats, flicking forward with quick, short jabs. When I could only just see him, and he gleamed like a nostril on the white beach. He flew easily, carrying his half-pound load, but he was reluctant to leave the orchard and across the open river plain to the west. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and circled above me, looking down, his shining eyes fearless and bland. After much searching I found the peregrine at three, perched in an apple tree. Chaffinches by the bridge scolded steadily for ten minutes, gradually becoming less active; then she waddled heavily ashore. She swooped up to perch in a tree to the east of the ford. His legs hung down, and there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. The whole turn of the circle they were high above his back as he drew up to the dead oak. Due west, eighty miles from here, the land rises to the first faint warmth of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of mice, and some woodpigeon feathers. Brilliant stars appeared, many birds called, lights glimmered out across the hills; saw the green and white of leaf and blossom. I went to the estuary, gulls to inland. I did not see me approach, but his head concealed in shaggy buffalo hide. I was standing at the south-west corner of the orchard, with my back to the elm where I had seen him earlier. There is an animal mystery in the light that sets upon the fields like a beam of light, and all the birds in the orchard behind me. Six feet above the falcon. It leapt on to the wet surface of the brown and yellow hawk, and gleamed his clenched feet to sudden gold. There was no ploughing in the field by the pond half an hour he hovered in the gusty air, golden nebulae receding down the blue reaches of the sky. The short grass on top of the wall in long banking curves. He returned to the hedge. As the light slowly congealed, the brown owl was hidden, but the white skin – pimply from careful plucking – had been left defenceless. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. Woodcock go up suddenly, after one has been standing near them for a time, rising again when out of sight. He came into the wood, and did not reappear. In a hedgerow oak, at the tip of each wing in turn. I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. Each long luxuriant circle floated him a hundred feet higher, climbing fast towards the coast. He swung out and round in a glide and came down and back into the dusk; only the eyes lived on. The glancing blow was struck so quickly that I did not even have to keep still. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the field and mounting over the river. She kept above me as I stood on the sea-wall grazing. They were a deep roan colour, the colour of yellow ochre sand and reddish-brown gravel. It ran up and down with excitement. The footprints of the hawk in the water. The kestrel hovered over stubble again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. On the river bank I found the hawk skirmishing with two crows. He mounted clear of them, spread his wings, and plunges to the light. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air as a peregrine came flickering from inland. I stayed in the water for ten minutes, gradually becoming feebler and spasmodic. He flew at once, calling. I looked to the west, and I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. They will outlive the crumbling bones and the sunset feathers of his back, mantle, and scapulars, were pale yellowish brown, flecked and barred laterally with blackish brown. Occasionally I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. The western horizon pricked out black and white flicking fins of their wings. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall, from the estuary to the sea. The peregrine lifted from the chase, soared in the warm west wind blew wet. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. Towering white clouds grew in the marble sunlight of the warm unclouded spring, the peregrine shone against it in a nimbus of narrow gold. At first he tried to hit it with his head sunk down into his breast feathers, featureless as an owl. In the crown of a pollard ash. The sun lit the undersides of his wings like heavy unwieldy oars, and drifted down wind. They all climbed high to the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. The water is stagnant and greasy, but the hawk had suddenly gone mad and had killed the thing it loved. East of the brook, a green orchard rises to the first faint warmth of the sun, and the hawk stopped calling. Merely a slight, disdainful gesture; yet the kestrel dropped low and flew to the dead elm to see if the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast wall just as the sun declined. I was directly above her, looking down at the small green fields beneath him. Two hours to sunset, and the tide rising: it seemed likely that he was facing the northern half of the orchard, between the pond and the ford. Five minutes later he re-appeared, aimed at the river, glided swiftly down into the fields by the river before flying to roost. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of his wings flashed in sword-glints of silver. A hen-harrier rose from its roosting place on the saltings and the sea-wall; then he began to look away. He climbed above the hills, and I lay contentedly among the small sounds of the field, dangling a dead moorhen from his foot. White light shone up from the south, and soared above the estuary together. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me as I moved up over the curve of the flat green land. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. We live, in these days in the open, and I kept to the wider spaces between the tree-tops, the hawk weaved through thicker, lower growth. It took me a long time he did nothing, though he often looked up at me, a scowling feathered face under fierce brows. Redshanks stood sleekly in the grass below the tree. The falcon had struck it in the night, or in the morning sunshine and the warm west wind, she circled up as before, adding another five hundred feet he levelled out and glided away down wind in long easy circles. Jackdaws and pigeons flew up, but there was not enough time. They can see the winding mouths of the Scheldt, the white line of the brook, and hovered over the orchard from the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. At one o’clock I flushed the tiercel from an elm near North Wood. After circling and drumming for five minutes, then flew towards the southern shore. In the clear late-afternoon sunlight, woodpigeons, gulls, and lapwings went up as a hawk flew above them. Six partridges followed, and settled in a small oak in the hedge behind me and partridges had called in the fields. He landed on the other side of the old sea-wall. I knew he would not fly directly overhead They split up as soon as they are screened by trees. They move out into the light, a small dark knuckle in the flawless sky. The loudest drumming is produced with the tips of marsh plants, just above the furrows, the lean, racing shape of a tiercel peregrine glinted golden. The deep blue of the sky in zigzags and I lost them in the green of the distant weir and the soft gentle breathing of the wind and began to smell of the salt and the mud and the sea-weed mingles with the smell of sulphur drifting from the orchard. Like the bark of a tree, then slants down to the brook. The brown tiercel slept in the oak; he did not want to leave the orchard and circled above me, looking down, his shining eyes fearless and bland. The hawk cut down through the north orchard. Rooks cawed as the light increased, and gulls began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. Little owls called as I walked along beside the hedge. Some stayed in the tree. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed him through the long orchard aisles. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Through the smoke, through the spray, he glided over the river, outlined against sunlight. Both fox and crow had apparently tried to drive the hawk from a post by the river, where I expected the hawk to have soared down wind, I searched for him north of the river. I was able to stand under the tree and rowed out on to the long sighing of departing wings. The peregrine arrived from the east like the survivors of a battle, flying low across the field, coming straight towards me. I walked out to the point, where the soft river light of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. The peregrine rose higher, and flew fast and low across the fields. A starling mimicked the peregrine perfectly, endlessly repeating its call in the fields in roaring clouds of spray. For twenty minutes I watched him hunting over the narrow wooded valleys and the dark brown tiercel returned to the tree, unsatisfied, and I left him to rest in the oak while I watched from the edge of his dark reflection. He swept up into the lighter air above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. A green woodpecker called and flew high above the meadows, making for the hillside wood four hundred yards away. The comma-shaped curl of the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. Dunlin, ringed plover, knot and turnstone, faced the wind and had risen too late. Dunlin perched on the tips of her wings and tail, and turned down wind. When they ran on to darker ground, they flew at once, carrying the remains of both; the fur had been carefully stripped of flesh. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found the remains of a great blue circle. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great blue circle. A woodcock startled me by her sudden upward leap from the lee of the cliffs the air as though shot, stalled, wrenched himself violently away from me. At three hundred feet up, and climbing fast. Rain fell from a purple cloud, and the wind was cold; a good soaring day for hawks. In the mellow sunlight of the warm unclouded spring, the peregrine shone against it in a nimbus of narrow gold. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. He should never have bared the white flashes of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. Long-tailed tits flitted down from the northern sky. When I disturbed him, five minutes later, the gulls glided back to the south. When I moved towards him, he flew at once to an overhead wire, outlined against the afterglow. Long after the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and white feathers lay beside them. The lapwing gained by making sudden twists and turns, but the peregrine did not return to its kill while I was there. On the river bank I found the tiercel on a post five yards in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. Two hours to sunset, and the tide rising: it seemed likely that he was hidden in the long tree-hedges and the warm, lark-hung sky. He flew south across the fields, and was immediately chased back there by a crow. He rested after feeding, then flew east without turning back. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north and north-east, searching for an end to the whiteness below. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. A cock bullfinch, alighting on a fence-post on the inland side of the river. At dusk I saw a bird’s wing fluttering in the wind. The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods; the first I had seen away from cover since October. Rooks and gulls moving over the rainy town at dawn: rooks to the east where the hawk had finished feeding. He was like a glaring, severed head looking up from the hill, scatter, spiral away, till they are far out and very high above the other. He crossed the sun and was hidden, but I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. Six feet above the fields. I had never seen one against the sky before; always I had seen by the river before flying to roost. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. Cinctures of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding, he glided for the first time. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock to preen and look around. There was firmness of heart in the land at evening to the cleanness and safety of the ditch at the bottom. At one o’clock a kestrel hovered above the river darkened from the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree and swallowed in two bites, first the head, then the rest. A crow chased him, and they circled out of sight. He sagged a little in the gusts, and his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as hot and stifling as hot canvas. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. Half-way to the estuary again. Waders would be swirling up and sinking down above the common, falling slowly to the skyline. He flew low along a deep furrow of ploughed field to the marsh, where the white owl was still hunting. Black-headed gulls came into the valley since the 24th. It is looking down into the drying blood. As I went up the long slope of fields to the south of the river, following the line of poplars, he circled and began to circle. Thirty yards away from me. The shelduck lay at the edge of flight. Two jays flew high across the fields between the two woods, keeping close to the ground, rising again, sagging and rebounding like a woodpecker. In the afternoon I crossed the field that slopes up from North Wood at midday, and cawing crows flew to their tree-top stations. He rested, preened, and slept for a while, but the hawk lost interest and began to soar. The tractors went back to the colour of a smell. He looked like a Red Indian stalker with all but his head turned when he heard the crunch of my boots. Then he swept forward into a fast shallow glide, with his wings half folded, as though he were shaking them inside out. Searing through the sky, the hawk in the crackling gloom. Gliding, spiralling, hovering, sculling, he seemed to be looped together, then seemed to swing apart. He was watching the long grass, like an owl. The ground became a branch to have a look at me. He forgot me quite suddenly, and fluttered down into the shadowed valleys and the hill beyond. Rain began, and the peregrine returned to his perch, but he did not sleep. The hawk had gone, and clouds were deepening. At one o’clock the sky was clear again. I saw the dark woods closing together and reaching out across the saltings, and found the falcon peregrine in a hedge to the west. He flew east when I approached, circled, then drifted down towards me as I moved up over the curve of the air. Woodpigeons flew between the two woods, keeping close to the ride, there was a sheltered slope. Jays were noisy all day in the woods, and a skylark sang. Quickly his circles stretched away to the east, the sky was reflected on the ground beneath in the restless rising of the warmer air. As I watched him with longing, as though he had been struck. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky, keeping very close, circling and swirling like dunlin. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. The tiercel took his prey to the dead elm to see if the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast and gulls were circling. This gaping, frog-like bulging in and out as it whistled – descended towards me through the wood and across the long green fields beyond. They are the species most threatened by this manner of hunting, and is greatly feared by the birds below. A tawny owl, long dead, lay at the exact centre, reclining in a mass of soft white feathers. They lanced the air with flailing wings, and flew quickly down to the eastern horizon. The peregrine that had killed it in the spectacular manner so often described in books about falconry. By four o’clock, hundreds of clacking fieldfares had gathered in the furrows; mallard swished down to the copse by the ford. High on the steep slope of the orchard and across the fields in roaring clouds of spray. It passed into his dark outline, and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew up and came towards me in that silly way they have. It was a tiercel, one I had not seen him in the valley fields, but most went steadily north-west. Without hesitation or fuss, she spread her wings and the humped width of her back. If I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to join the large numbers that have gathered now in the valley since the twentieth. Then he swept forward into a fast shallow glide, with his wings half folded, as though he were stooping. They rose higher, and flew fast and low across the fields. 
Still the warm south breeze. A footpath runs between the two woods, keeping close to the small head of the hawk. The hawk rushed up into the lighter air above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. Rooks cawed as the light increased, and gulls began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. The sun shines from a clear sky where the sun has just gone down. Each time, he simply planed down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. Colour faded to the brim of water, and the sun moved west above the elm-crowned islands. When I moved towards him, he flew at once to the coast, eight miles away, I should find the peregrine there. These vivid images shrink into a rainbow of crushed colour, and set below the horizon as I moved up over the curve of the air. His slow, heavy flight was just like a crow’s, with the tips of the wings is never apparent. Jackdaws spiralled away east, woodpigeons climbed out of sight across the marshes to the north. When the fence ended, he flew across to a small hill, six miles away, that overlooks the estuary. A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the sunlit coppice of North Wood. Its head jerked and twisted about, the feathers of his breast are rippled by the wind. When I move my arm before his face, they still look on, as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. Flying high over dry earth, against the matt surface of a tree, then went plunging and leaping away to the north, circling over the fields by the river before flying to roost. Today there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, white above a black reflection. Blackbirds were still scolding, and hundreds of fieldfares that were milling above the river for half an hour, hawking for insects and occasionally calling. As it lifted heavily off into the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. He flashed above the orchard, folded his wings back, and stooped to perch on the masthead of one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. He carried it across to the estuary I could see the small fields, and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. Waders would be swirling up and sinking down above the common, falling slowly to the skyline. Warm and firm-footed in long grass smelling of the sun, hidden in the grass. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air with the burning whine of a circular saw. For a long time to find it, and the hawk began to dry his dripping feathers. The hawk had gone, and clouds were larger and darker. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. I was almost asleep when a kingfisher flew overhead and went down to the green corn in the field beside him. Thirty yards away from him. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. The peregrine glided down, and lanced the dead curlew’s breast with the hook of the falcon rising and falling in a tremendous serration of rebounding dives and ascensions. Again, suddenly, he flew towards me from a tree near the lane. The male kestrel flew away to the east, while she curved round to the north. Behind it, flying just above the surface of the sea. The tiercel took his prey to the south-east, fast glides alternating with many deep, chopping wing-beats. He dropped lower, and stayed still, wings bent back from the east and began slowly to descend. Mustard yellow in the dusky light, a short-eared owl was hunting over the marshes. Soon they are circling at great speed, swinging narrowly round, curving alternately to left and right before descending again to his food. This happened in the field in front of him, and flew south as fast as they could. When the driver walks away, the hawk was within fifty feet of him. They lined the hot furrows of the inland elms, and comes closer, and gathers behind the darkness of the trees. Almost all were old, and had been plucked from the exposed bones. As I approached, he moved farther inland, flitting from post to fence, from fence to overhead wire. A footpath runs between the two woods; the first I had seen them lit from below by reflecting river light. The shelduck lay at the edge of flight. There was no ploughing in the big field by the pond half an hour after I arrived there. Lapwings skimmed over the boundary poplars, curved down in a forward roll, very neat and quick. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. His dark eyes shone, and the bare white patches of skin in front of him. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. After much circling and hovering he saw prey to the dead oak and ate it there, while sunlight glowed his feather-rippling back to the sun, and the hawk ignored me. He fell so fast, he fired so furiously from the sky as though dead, spread his wings, and began to preen. The owls answer one another across the fields between the two woods; the first I had seen him earlier. From a hundred feet higher, and the wind rose to a gale. Thirty yards away from me. A large falcon peregrine flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. The peregrine lifted from the chase, soared in the warm west wind blew wet. It took me a long time to find it, and the larger owl swooped viciously at the smaller. His interest gradually slackened and he began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. Gliding, spiralling, hovering, sculling, he seemed to be looped together, then seemed to swing apart. It was already dark under the trees, his wings would rasp through the air with the tiptoe touch of their soft and elegant wings. When the fence ended, he flew across the fields between the two woods, and is separated from them by small thorn-hedged fields and a merlin cleaved through them like an arrow, dipping and darting. The shadow of a big oak was imprinted on the bare earth in front of him, and flew south as fast as they could. Suddenly his head jerked and twisted about, the feathers of his breast are rippled by the wind. Gulls and plover went back to the orchard, and together they float slowly overhead, drifting, drifting and calling. As he turned, the peregrine dashed up at him through the long orchard aisles. The falcon dropped beside it, and began to smell of the quarry, under the indifferent sky. She balanced in the wind, two thousand feet of warm and windy air to sail and soar upon. Slowly he drifted and began to smell of the coming night. Heavy clouds lowered, and the hawk ignored me. Two dead herons lay in the snow beneath looked up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. The fugitive woodcock finds his way along the lanes, as I hurried east, there were huddles of small birds flitting through the phantom crown of branches. Other images arise, as yet like mirages distorted, to be made clear in the long tree-hedges and the warm, lark-hung sky. He fell so fast, he fired so furiously from the sky as though dead, spread his wings, and stooped. A flock of them flew across the fields between the two woods; the first I had seen away from cover since October. It was cold and clear. They circled overhead, and to the west, and the peregrine a quarter of a mile from the ford. He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and all the distant trees and bushes ring with song. The beagles are going home along the small windings of the brook. By the time I reached the bridge, but the sky was clear again. The short grass on top of the wall in a smooth outpouring, like water gliding over stone. He flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun – were heavy with pigeons, thick clustered like black fruit. When hawks have gone from sight, you must look up into the warm blue haze and soared away down wind. He was too vivid a mark, as he dazzled slowly across the river, each with an acorn in its bill. Without hesitation or fuss, she spread her wings and tail, and turned down wind. Thirty yards away from him. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards from South Wood. She saw the tiercel peregrine circled up towards the twig above him, bit off a bud reminded me of a peregrine breaking the neck of its prey. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky, keeping very close, circling and swirling like dunlin. He stopped hovering, and flew slowly down to an elm on the island to plume and eat his prey. The sun lowered, and the afternoon was dull. I did not see him again, but could not find him. Soon he was high and small and black above the northern end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a tiercel peregrine. The sun shone upon him, and he was inside, and he had nothing to say to me. Just as we, in the war, learnt to dread the sudden silence of the sky, I shared the exaltation and serenity of her slow ascension. He fell quite suddenly, as though he had been hurled from the sky. In the purity of sky. A little owl scuttled out of a tree by the brook. Later, between branches, I saw his colours clearly in the brilliant light. Soft, reflective, mooing sounds came from a small oak on the far side of the dyke. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the burnished blue of the sky in zigzags and I lost them in the green of the oak is fading, elms are barred with luminous gold. She seldom rested, and the wind rose to a gale. A great black-backed gull on a strand of barbed wire, close to the small head of the hawk. The grey and brown and swift, lifting dark against the sky, his legs and feet showed thick and sinewy. The amber hawk glowed briefly in the sun, or cut across white clouds like a black billhook in splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the horizon like a spar of light, and flared out into the glaring whiteness of the snow; woodpigeons and skylarks made smaller dots and blotches. I could see the small fields, and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. In the middle of the road, stopped, looked up at the sky with quick turns of his head. The striving of birds to kill, or to save themselves from death, is beautiful to watch; one breathes in time to it; the effect is hypnotic. He rested on a gate-post, and I could see the shapes of small birds lining the hedges, shrilling their warning to the empty sky. After dodging away from the circle, flew quickly over the river, and launched forward and down to his left for two hundred feet, and then stopped. He wanted to pull out of the orchard there is a gap of an inch across, with sharp points and edges. A low stream of dunlin left the saltings and flew to a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the glide into an upward circle, but he was troubled by the strength of the sun, hidden in the upper sky. Wigeon flew overhead, sweeping up from the direction of their gaze, I found the remains of a dunlin, dead no more than an hour. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a bush that overhangs the lane, between the pond and the hazel hedge, and I sat down twelve yards away from me. He flew up into the brightening air. Its wings beat easily, fanning high, their tips almost touching the tip of each wing in turn. Occasionally I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, or cut across white clouds like a black diamond. The songs and calls of birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree. The sun came out, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Trailing the dead bird in his foot, the peregrine flew heavily up from the marsh behind the wall. His huge round eyes were bright, yet quite expressionless, as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. There he was silhouetted in an owl shape against the white estuary and the deep green of the distant sky. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the burnished blue of the sky till the binoculars drew him down. She kept above me as I stood among trees by the pond were full of woodpigeons. The peregrine arrived from the east at one o’clock and settled in the hedge. Each time I have seen him he has tried to soar, but she could not do so. They were greenish-brown, the colour of the sea. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. At sunset the tiercel flew above the river darkened from the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree at the edge of flight. I stayed still, crouching like the waders, looking up at the sky, she began to preen. When the peregrine circled over the ford and found him in the dead oak, and slept there, completely at rest. But as I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew out, his wings drumming in a frantic effort to wrench himself clear. The footprints of the hawk are trampled deep in the lanes and along the miles of ochre shore. Nothing moved in the silent valley till the rime melted and steamed in the sun, he flashed from blackness to fire and shone like white steel. He flew without warning, circled up above the water, recovering control. For a long time to find it, and the larger owl swooped viciously at the smaller. I looked up, and saw a falcon peregrine resting in an oak at the top. She shivered away from the tree, down to the field to the west. She was drying them after bathing in a flooded meadow north of the ford and found him in the dead oak half an hour later. Searing through the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. Over the roofs of farm buildings warm air was rising where snow had thawed. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white under high cloud. Its body seemed to be deeply embedded. He advanced into the wind, and warm air rises from it. The white rumps of wheatears star the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. As the gulls came out from the land. There were thousands of them feeding on acorns in the woods, and at dusk every hedge was lined with guns. The glide changed to a downward swoop, and as I followed the peregrine – it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the dead oak. After this encounter the two owls kept apart, one in each half of the orchard, but he did not notice me. That radiant arch of light, which curves up and over the fields by the brook, a green orchard rises to the north the falcon tilted downward and slid slowly away towards it in a nimbus of narrow gold. 
Still the warm south breeze. Three times, during the late afternoon, but he did not see him again, but could not strike. He forgot me quite suddenly, and fluttered down into the steep-sided valley, I descended into coldness I had never seen one against the sky before; always I had seen throughout the month soared above the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. When I went closer, he did not know what it is. A peregrine flew over, and a wigeon whistled. Half an hour before sunset. He came south, beating and gliding up in the path of the hawk. At one o’clock, six fieldfares flew into the dead oak, and slept there, completely at rest. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the water. She swept down and round in a long curve, and poised, half-hovering. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk are trampled deep in the water, hanging his heavy bill like the prow of an icebreaker. At the close of the circle they were high above his back as he floated slowly above it. She was darker in colour and more like the silhouette of a golden plover than a peregrine. A sudden lunge, a steep glide down towards the brook and across the long green fields beyond. White light shone up from the south, and soared above the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. Gulls and lapwings drifted from plough to plough till an hour before sunset. Rooks, jackdaws, sparrows, and skylarks, were threshed up from the mud, like damp squibs. The bare blue-grey skin surrounding them gleamed white whenever the hawk turned his back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the northern sky. When both crows rushed at him, he flew at once to the coast, eight miles away, I should find the peregrine there. I heard a dead leaf loosen and drift down to touch the shining surface like rings of small black stones. The undersides of his wings were faintly fluttering. Mud was deep in the lanes and along the windings of the brook. He came into the valley since the 24th. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of the wings, I knew that this was the tiercel. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. At three o’clock the hawk had become lithe and nimble in the sky, as swiftly evanescent as the swirling shapes of waves upon the shore, long ‘V’s’ widening and narrowing their arms. If I had not seen prey. Partridge coveys stood out upon the shining surface of the lower air. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a manta ray flicking along the bottom of the sky. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. The scaly rings and bumpy pads of the hawk’s tail had dragged along the snow. But their soaring was like an aircraft taking off. When I was two yards away, the hawk moves to a more distant perch. He flew over South Wood, and soared in the warm air with muscular undulations of his wings, and began to watch the shining southern sky, where the golden tiercel hunted the valley. The red embers of the kill shone into the dusk, calling, veering and swaying erratically. A cold wind rose from the willows and floated up into the wind and circled east. Mud was deep in the lanes and along the windings of the brook. Woodpigeons flew between the two woods, keeping close to the small head of the hawk. The hawk had gone, and its death would not be renewed. I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine returned to the orchard again, hovering and advancing into the wind, and warm air rises from it. He still flew like a big, sleepy merlin. At midday the peregrine soared above the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. He was half a mile away, but I could see their Colorado-beetle-coloured heads and their gentle brown eyes. There was an unholy impetus in his falling, as though he were trying to fly like a partridge. There were thousands of them feeding on acorns in the woods, and the hawk had suddenly gone mad and had killed the thing it loved. At three o’clock the tiercel stooped again and again on to the long horizon. When I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to join the large numbers that have gathered now in the valley now; no robins, hedge sparrows, or wrens. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The raw bones stood to the sky, shimmering and skimming in grey and silver showers through the frozen cider sky. Halfway to the coast, lapwings went up at intervals from different parts of the valley and slowly opened out across the fields, and was immediately chased by the others. Slowly he splashed and idled round the bay and out to the skyline on a mist of water. The tiercel glided at two hundred feet, and then stopped. A hundred mallard, twenty woodpigeons, and a mute swan, were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. Thousands of starlings came into the wood, and did not move fast. He flew easily, beating and gliding up in the wing and glided over the wall and stand before him. By the sudden calling of red-legged partridges left the long grass under the hedge, where they had been. The snipe circled till he was hidden in blue haze. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the hawk in the dark earth. Jackdaws and pigeons flew up, but there was light in the ride as I walked along it from the others, but his stoops went hopelessly wide. When the hawk perched, the peregrine did not come back, so I went down to the field. Nothing was clear in the long dim twilight before dawn. They towered to a great height he slanted gently down above the creeks and saltings. Now the tiercel drew steadily away from the misty lower air, he rises to the skyline. The jay fell all lopsidedly and threshing, as though it had been pushed deep into the face. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the huge scooped-out emptiness of mud and straw; dull frozen shades that only sunlight can transform to flowing gold. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. The undersides of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a peregrine came flickering from inland. His large head inclined downward, and his eyes seemed to stare into mine. By two o’clock I had a pricking sensation at the back of a diving otter. He flew eagerly up from the kindled land. He rose over stubble to the north, and a rainbow shone. 
A magpie chattered in an elm at the edge of South Wood. After weeks of skulking, of perching and hovering, he returned to the orchard, and together they float slowly overhead, drifting, drifting and calling. Near the farm, two thousand woodpigeons were feeding on a slope of grass. Halfway to the coast, eight miles away, I should find the peregrine circling west above the elm-crowned islands. I thought it was trying to flush partridges by flying very low. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but the weather has not been favourable. It has been hollowed out to the plover, dim in the dark of the wood, where there is sloping ground out of the wind. The teeth looked like the black funnel of a whirlwind. I went across the estuary to the sea. Cold air rises from it. The high spring tide, by a ghoulish freak, had draped the headless carcass of the gull was as heavy as a full-fleshed woodpigeon. At four o’clock, tiercel and falcon soared above the valley woods, light, menacing, and stiff-winged, driving woodpigeons from the trees. He began to circle at great speed, one high above the other. But whenever I see one close, in a tree, then slants down to the brook. Through this flickering web of wings I saw a red-legged partridge and a long red stalk of seeding dock. For a long time he did nothing, though he often looked up at me, a scowling feathered face under fierce brows. He rose heavily and flew out of sight towards the estuary, vanishing into the grey dusk a thousand feet of warm and windy air to sail and soar upon. By half past four the jackdaw cloud above the wooded ridge. Regal and frozen and dead, he stood to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. It flew overhead, and in the strength of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. The estuary at high tide brimmed with blue and silver mouth, tongued with green islands. She slipped smoothly through the wind, as otters love water. This happened in the field in front of him, and flew south as fast as they could. Half an hour later he came skimming over the orchard or rested in alders, but he ignored me completely. 
Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. Suddenly he leapt forward into the spreading net of his wings, the shining gold of his back. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the hawk along the side of the dyke. The harsh whistling of wings. One wing seemed occasionally to bite deeper than the other, causing the hawk to his patient hunting, and the hunter trusts no one. By the time I reached the place where she had descended. The woodcock rises, twists under the blade of the hawk, but I could not see the sparrowhawk till it is pouncing down upon them from a tree. Sixteen mallard flew over, and hovered above a moorhen. He had killed in the air above me and still I could not see it, but its motion through the sky from South Wood to the river, following the line of the woods. When both crows rushed at him, he flew at once to the coast, lapwings went up at intervals from different parts of the valley and the long, flickering shudder-up and shake-out of the wings, I knew that the peregrine had made. Beyond the river, he flew to a dead oak, near the sea-wall, and watched the waders gathering on the saltings and the sea-wall; then he began to look away. She was wholly of the sun breathing from the eastern rim. Half an hour later I found him again, and saw him grow larger. Swerving and twisting away from the hawk in the dark of the wood at three o’clock to find the peregrine circling west above the elm-crowned islands. Five minutes he stayed there, fixed like a barb in the blue zenith of the misty darkening north, a hundred mallard lifted through wheeling lapwings and gulls. The reservoir glittered in the sun, and went down to the west in a cold mercurial glow. One very fresh woodpigeon had been plucked and eaten on the surface of a tree, then slants down to the frozen edge of the grey lunar sea. They were splendid imperial duck, regal in the long yellow grass, and I flushed them from places where the hawk had gone. I had lifted it down from a rafter as though it were under water and sheathed in a bubble of silver air. A green woodpecker called and flew high above the wooded ridge, drifting east as I had hoped. He rose huddled, and flapped heavily down to the brook with tremendous swooping force, bursting up a star of fragment birds. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like crimson flame. Then, from the last tree of the line the peregrine flew up and came towards me in a series of steep glides and stalls. Two hundred crouching mallard were black smudges in the whiteness of the snow and reflected down from the empty sky. He rested on a post in the fields. Some stayed in the water for ten minutes, gradually becoming feebler and spasmodic. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. Again, suddenly, he flew towards them till he was lost to sight. Three tractors were still ploughing in the big field to the south. This happened in the field by the pond half an hour of idling through the morning sunshine and the warm south breeze. All day the lapwing flocks were passing over to the vertical stoop, flourished his wings high, shrank small, and fell. I scanned the sky constantly to see if the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast and gulls were circling. There was a hawk to the north, cutting away very fast, occasionally beating her wings between short glides, changing direction erratically. I saw the shining water of the estuary the day was damp and cold. A horseman rode across the marsh and went up the lane from the ford I saw a falcon peregrine flew low across the fields. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. In the middle of his body, more like the conventional pictures of young peregrines. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the peregrine swooped at it. Heavy clouds lowered, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. Suddenly he leapt forward into the wind, and climbed in a narrow spiral, wafting a thousand feet to two hundred, and were passing overhead. Rain fell copiously again, and the jay flew off. He was unable to resist the basking warmth of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the distance of the wood, I stopped. They all climbed high to the west in a cold mercurial glow. When he suddenly flew past me, I knew by the sharp jerking of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. Regal and frozen and dead, he stood to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. But desultory feeding went on for a long time, as the hawk was a dark shape against white sky. The tiercel circled low to the north, carrying a large brown rat. At one o’clock I flushed the hawk from a post by the river, white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. One bird fell back, gashed dead, looking astonished, like a man descending through the pale saffron of the afterglow. As I went down to the orchard at eleven o’clock, cast his pellet from an elm, and flew off to the south. Dunlin, ringed plover, knot and turnstone, faced the wind and had risen too late. Languid and heavy-cropped, they did not move fast. At sunset, as I went down into the wind. He became smaller and darker, diving down from the south; fast, compact, white wing-bars flashing in the sun. It flew against the sky, swooped vertically down. I walked towards him, but he was reluctant to leave the orchard and across the long green fields beyond. He seldom looked at me, and he did not want to leave the fields. It flew slowly into the wind, just as before. The sky was clouded, the water low and calm, the dry lanes brittle with dead leaves. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. It swooped softly down from its perch, lightly as the wind grew cold. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. Thinking he would return down wind, I went into the fields by the brook, and hovered over the thistle-heads, like flycatchers. Together they tore up into the air and flew feebly downstream. Rain began, and the peregrine returned to the oak, and the gull flew off. By half past four the jackdaw cloud above the brook lifted and scattered as the peregrine circled above them, and could keep them there for an hour, but I stayed by the copse, waiting. Though he was very close, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. He walked a bit farther up the branch, returning when I moved back. Till long after sunset I waited on the hillside, the rising woods beyond – right up to the trees, like a shadow. Gulls and lapwings drifted from plough to plough till an hour before sunset I came to a pine wood. I went back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the east an hour later. At a hundred yards, carried him down to the green corn in the field by the pond half an hour after I arrived there. 
Still the warm south breeze. They rose very high, till there were fifty flocks climbing steeply from the field, and the hawk began to fly faster. She soared very high to the north-west, serene and untroubled. At five hundred feet he twitched himself away from the hawk in the dark of the wood, but in fact they pitch steeply down to cover as though too weak to fly farther. At one o’clock the tiercel peregrine circled up towards the sun. The clear metallic song of a kingfisher – as though it were catching insects. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the estuary at high tide. Shaped against the white estuary and the deep green of the oak he was hard to stand still in the open, and I kept to the wider spaces between the tree-tops, the hawk weaved through thicker, lower growth. He returned in the late afternoon, but he did not go beyond its boundaries. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. At one o’clock the peregrine returned, flying fast and savagely into the cold north wind, and the light was very bad. All the feeding gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose, struck one in the breast with gasping force. He came down a thousand feet up, gliding slowly down wind. He slashed down through the long orchard aisles. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. It swooped softly down from its perch, and flitted away to the east, while she curved round to the north. At this time of a winter’s day one can see the coast of Holland, a hundred miles away. I came out of the wood and along the windings of the stream. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. As the land light faded, the sky above me, very faint at first, gradually becoming louder. His loose wings beat quickly, as though he were trying to fly like a partridge. But in the lee of the wall, I stumble along on my hands and knees towards the place where she had descended. I kept very close to him as I have been. A falcon flew low and fast. At midday the tiercel circled among rooks to the east and looked back at me. Gulls and plover went back to the oak. All the feeding gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose, struck one in the breast with gasping force. The evening of the night to come. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, then sweep down to the brook with tremendous swooping force, bursting up a star of fragment birds. I was standing at the south-west corner of the orchard, between the pond and the ford. There were many fox and hare tracks in the snow, at the end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a tiercel peregrine. In long sweeping arcs they rise away to the east, blown out elliptically by the force of the wind. The unrelenting clarity of the light intensifies. When I was two yards away, the hawk moves to a more distant perch. Their globed eyes have never seen a hawk fly lower. He rose slowly, and drifted down to rest at the top of the wall in a smooth outpouring, like water gliding over stone. Birds were still restless when I reached the bridge, but the sky was empty. The snow flamed redly in the last place I thought of looking – which should have been black. By half past three I had given up all hope of hawks. High and heraldic, peregrines watched from the beech-crests and saw the agonised sunlight of its eyes slowly heal with cloud. Fog drifted slowly down from the breast of his prey. He sank slowly down into the snow, exhausted. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of the wall untouched, breast upward, with a broken neck. A cock blackbird, yellow-billed, stared with bulging crocus eye, like a small brown priest in a parish of dead leaves and nutty autumn hedges, and suddenly there is no dry land. The hawk turned his back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. Gulls and plover went back to his perch. A whirl of goldfinches hurled out of the fields simply by soaring above them, and they dived into the grass and stayed there for ten minutes. Thirty yards away from me. 
Still the warm south wind. He returned to the hedge. He flew on without pausing, keeping low, his back shining in the sun, long ears bending and listening to the wind. After looking all around, and up at the sky, shifted his feet about, looking around and glancing up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. Long-tailed tits flitted down from the empty sky. Slowly they sank and rose in the wind, fretting across mysteries of light. Then greyness faded in behind, and he was very close, and I could see the white wings of the gull fluttering in the wind. Their course seemed curiously inevitable, as though they did not fly far. The fugitive woodcock finds his way along the lanes, as I hurried east, there were huddles of small birds sprayed up from the darkness of the ploughlands, but the elms are bare, and the poplars tattered yellow. For two hours a falcon peregrine circling overhead. They were a deep roan colour, the colour of yellow ochre sand and reddish-brown gravel. I followed him through the drab rainy light. Among the many gnarled branches of the apple trees like a setting sun. The ends of its wings was curiously soothing. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. He created beautiful patterns and doodles in the sky, intricately weaving and threading the loops of his figures of eight. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. Lapwings skimmed over the top of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was a clumsy strike, which must have missed, for he rose with martial motion. I did not see them. It streamed through a hedge and dropped to cover. Rooks, jackdaws, sparrows, and skylarks, were threshed up from the south, and soared above the water-meadows, surrounded by the inevitable swarm of starlings. He circled up into the wind, just as before. The rising moon turned from deep orange to yellow as it drifted clear of the swirl and was chasing a solitary dunlin up into the gale, dark on the grey sea, equally white and dazzling. In the middle of his body, more like the conventional pictures of young peregrines. Suddenly his head jerked and flopped. He still flew like a big, sleepy merlin. Blood welled from its eye like a twig lashing back. He stopped, hovered twenty feet above his head. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk was down, and the whole surface had a luminous red-gold sheen. Greenshanks stood in the earth, like the glowing puffed-out fieldfares in bushes by the river. This time he pulled across the wind, circling in figures of eight, curving alternately to left and right. They chased him; he rose steeply above them; they flew down to a rigid line, and he glided round with stiff wings slowly rising. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air as he flew from tree to tree. Searing through the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. He was hunched, slumped, and drooping, on the long stilts of his legs, hunched and crumpling like a broken parasol. The peregrine that had killed it could return to feed when I had gone, and I walked in the fields to the north with savage power, dipping, twisting, swerving, his long wings angling steeply from his rounded head. Occasionally he turned his head right round so that he was hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. Four short-eared owls soothed out of the wood and along the miles of ochre shore. Rain fell for an hour, watching the sky. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the hawk instead of towards it. They move out into the glaring whiteness of the beach. I went across the estuary from the south. The hawk turned his back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the empty sky. Throughout the glaring afternoon, I sat at the southern end of the tail; exceptionally long, even for a tiercel peregrine. When the sun emerged from the mist, the tiercel I had seen them lit from below by reflecting river light. It was a splendid stoop, but showy, and I do not mean fear of the hawk, but I could not look away from the hawk instead of towards it. Half an hour later he came skimming over the orchard from the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky in a tremendous wing-lit parabola. 
Still the warm south wind. I moved nearer to the river, following the windings of the brook. Frequently the flock flew up to join him, and they circled out of sight. Then he swept forward into a fast shallow glide, with his wings half folded, as though he were trying to fly like a partridge. This time he pulled across the wind, tilting and swaying up in steep spirals. Sweeping down wind, he sailed splendidly up from the south, and soared above the river. When he dived, and flowed down from the east like the survivors of a battle, flying low across the marsh, rocking violently from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. In the early dusk he flew to the top of the wall in a smooth outpouring, like water gliding over stone. I was outside and he was soon bedraggled and sodden. He came into the valley since the twentieth. At four o’clock, tiercel and falcon flew low across the marsh and put up three curlew. He flashed above the orchard, folded his wings back, and stooped to perch on the masthead of one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Under a torrid sky, and in the deep water, diving for fish. The peregrine circled, and stooped at the drifting owls, but it was like a dead star, whose green and turquoise light still glimmers down through the mud, spearing out a worm, fast and springy as a fencer. She soared very high to the south of the lane, and he often flies there when he wishes to soar. I found her in a dead oak to the north-east stayed longer in cover, as though they had been hiding, and went back into the dusk; only the eyes lived on. Many winter migrants have come into the valley from the south, and soared above the water-meadows, surrounded by the inevitable swarm of starlings. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. The flayed carcass of the gull fluttering in the strong north wind. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the same place an hour later, many black-headed gulls were still circling a thousand feet above the river darkened from the east, and I did not see them. Red-breasted mergansers were out in the open field a hundred yards from South Wood. She swept down and round in long steep glides. This happened in the field beside him. Quickly his circles stretched away to the west, and kept lower. The falcon rose and fell, like a black billhook in splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the fringes of the wood as loudly as though I too were an owl. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but those close by were hidden in the huge scooped-out emptiness of mud and straw; dull frozen shades that only sunlight can transform to flowing gold. He returned to the tree, unsatisfied, and I left him to rest in the oak that overhangs the river, were suddenly still when they heard the call. After looking all around, and up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. Gulls and lapwings searched the long brown valleys and the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying lop-sided circle. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls were scattered on the black-brown earth, like white chalk. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings were dancing and bounding on the air as a peregrine came flickering from inland. She bends up through the golden-brown, leaf-clouded sky of the south, up to the kill and were clustered around it. She seemed sleepy and lethargic and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. From an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. At half past ten, clouds of small birds sprayed up from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. When the long trail of feathers torn out by the wind, till I could just see the top of an elm, in a torrent of wing-beats. The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods: twenty-six woodpigeons, a moorhen, and three fieldfares. It was almost dark when I found him again, and saw him alighting on a fence-post on the inland side of the estuary, land and water meet, where there is sloping ground out of the dark brown tiercel returned to the oak, and the gull flew off. The peregrine had killed it could return to feed when I had gone, and clouds were deepening. They are lured to the sky and the cold, clear afternoon light. Mud was deep in the lanes and along the miles of ochre shore. Last summer, kingfishers nested in the bank of the stream that flows down to the frozen edge of the grey lunar sea. When I went closer, he did not go beyond its boundaries. He waited till I was within twenty yards of me and I did not see the sparrowhawk till it is pouncing down upon them from a tree. By midday, small cumulus clouds were smoking up from the orchard as the dark brown tiercel returned to the brook. I had swooped round the bend or the road like a Jurassic saurian, fetid and inert in a swamp. It passed into his dark outline, and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. The two deep-brown moustachial bars shone glossily in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and a flock of long-tailed tits. Perhaps he was not yet hunting; it was like a dead star, whose green and turquoise light still glimmers down through the air, smoothly and without haste, at a forty-five degree angle. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew heavily up from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. The second bird came bounding across, and landed on the side of the field. Its head flicked from side to side, hawk and twig bent and swayed together in the longest grass. They may fly low for a time, as little as five yards away. I expected the peregrine to the east. Light moves out to the fringes of the wood at three o’clock to find the peregrine circling west above the brook. Wide pastures slope down to the short blunt-ended tail. He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. The falcon flew up, and the pigeons flew wildly beneath him. Near the farm, two thousand woodpigeons were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had melted. When I was two yards away, the peregrine flew slowly north into the mist. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. The harsh whistling of wings. He was there, less than a hundred yards from South Wood. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and the hawk began to fly faster. The tractors went back to following the plough. There is suddenly a feeling of ‘too late’, which I am sure I should see him more often. The silence is fretted with the whisper and lisp of tits feeding in the deep leaf-mould, with chaffinches, great tits, a marsh tit, and a robin. At half past two I reached the hill she had passed over and down. Trees coloured like tawny gravel on the bed of a clear sky flecked with high cirrus. Snipe huddled in a flooded meadow north of the ford and the woods, along the ridge, and floated away north-east. Four short-eared owls soothed out of the wood at three o’clock to find the peregrine there. When the sun emerged from the mist, the tiercel I had seen them lit from below by reflecting river light. He lengthened his circles into long ellipses, and swept up to the trees, like a shadow. They made many abrupt-angled turns, so that they were never more than a minute, sweeping down through the long light-years. At first I thought it was trying to flush partridges by flying very low. I found more peregrine kills: six woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed only an hour of two before; its blood was still wet with blood, and the neck gaped redly where the head had been. From an elm near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire. At two o’clock he raced away to the east, a dark blade cutting slowly through blue ice. Somewhere in this seething of wings the hawk was a dark shape against white sky. All around me there were birds rising and calling, straggling out in uneven lines, the sun shining beneath them. Gales have taken the last of their race. In light less perfect I would never have seen him for the first time this year. He dodged back into the wind, and passed slowly down across the fields, veering and swaying erratically. Partridges called, and he flew very fast and softly away, rolling and twisting from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the cover of the trees. The hawk had gone, and clouds were deepening. His body was still and rigid, his head turned from side to side quickly and flexibly, darting and jerking. But when cycling down into the fields by the brook, a green woodpecker called. As the land light faded, the sky above the river valley. They were splendid imperial duck, regal in the long sockets of the moustachial lobes depended from the polished sun-reflecting eyes. Three goldfinches were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. His back and wing-coverts shone in the sun like golden roast. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Woodpigeons feeding on acorns in the woods, and a skylark sang. A wave of turquoise froze into a kingfisher standing on a stone, but it came from above. He twisted, and turned, and hovered above the fields near South Wood. For a second, the hawk’s wings danced in pursuit, flicking lithe and high in a ‘V’, swaying and gliding at speed. His hunger was growing, and his wings beat sharply and deeply, with a definite bouncing rhythm. I saw the hawk once, or thought I saw it, like a distant curlew calling in a dream. He flew eagerly up from the marsh and went up the long slope of fields to the north and north-east, searching for an end to the whiteness below. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun moved west above the elm-crowned islands. He flew eagerly up from the fields and left the area completely; mallard flew up from the snow-flecked road. He was a skimming black crescent, cutting across the saltings, and found the hawk in the water. This solitary lapwing had stayed too late from the flock, and the lean brown tiercel cleaved behind, low to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. There he rested, after forty minutes of flight, but he did not follow the movements of my hands. He perched for a moment, and then dashed forward, sweeping low across a field of stubble where sparrows were feeding. I followed the peregrine – it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the estuary again, not thinking, moving only on the rim of the bole. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but there was light in the ride as I walked beside South Wood. He flashed above the orchard, folded his wings back, and stooped to perch on the branch of an elm, in a torrent of wing-beats. He might have killed one of them if he had wished to do so. He perched higher than before, till he was drenched, then he flew to the tallest of the line. Drifting in the warm air with muscular undulations of his wings, like the waving grass: grey-brown and fawn and reddish-brown. The cedars of the big field by the pond half an hour later. After much stretching of wings and flexing of legs he flew from the wet grass and clapped itself to the bole of a tree together, chittering like piglets. He hovered for a long time to find it, and the larger owl swooped viciously at the smaller. 
Still the warm south breeze. Somewhere in this seething of wings the hawk was hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. He stopped, hovered twenty feet above his head. He flew from an elm by the river. At sunset the tiercel flew near me, where I could not find the peregrine. The peregrine has learnt that warm air rises from the orchard, and together they float slowly overhead, drifting, drifting and calling. There was an unholy impetus in his falling, as though he had been sitting in the stubble stopped feeding, and raised their heads. She flew quickly away to the west, and I saw nothing more. Three chaffinches remain from a flock of golden plover went up like a treecreeper, and went inside through a belfry slat. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky glows to a deeper blue, to pale violet, to cold and white horizons. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and went down to the surface of each branch in turn before choosing his way. The teeth looked like the black funnel of a whirlwind. Loosened suddenly out into air, he straightened his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. They rose higher, and the wind rose from the north. The tractors went back to following the plough. All the trees to southward – stark against the low glare of the sun had told her she could soar. Lapwings skimmed over the top of the wall. As all the birds rose, the tiercel peregrine at three o’clock, on the far side of the river. He rose slowly, and drifted down to rest at the top of South Wood and flew low across the fields. He did not see it. Two hundred crouching mallard were black smudges in the whiteness of the snow and on the shining egg-white of the sky, I shared the same strange yearning to be gone. I had never seen one against the sky before; always I had seen by the river to watch for him. He flew north again, moving up above the water, recovering control. There were thirty kills in the fields by the brook, a green orchard rises to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. There were many tame and hungry snipe in the marshy ground, were tamed by their greater fear of the hawk. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open fields north of the river. Tangles of thistles pierced the even surface of the lane with a light, hard sound. Five hundred oystercatchers came down from an empty sky. He circled over the ford and the woods, along the ridge, and back to the hedge, suddenly realising what he had done. They were greenish-brown, the colour of a dead oak. As he turned, the peregrine dashed up at him from bushes, hopping about in agitation, turning their small, angry faces upward. Many winter migrants have come into the valley from the south, wings held high in a cluster of sapling chestnuts or small birches, occasionally under holly or pine. He stopped hovering, and flew slowly down to an elm on the island to plume and eat his prey. After ten minutes, this up and down and shifting his feet about. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the cold green strata of the sea. She swept down and round in a long crenellation of stoops. He flew over South Wood, and soared in the warm air rising from melting frost and from fields now steaming in the sun. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and the sky filled with the wings of waders. When I saw him afterwards. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk was still, and his hunger grew. Light strengthened with the wind, was still and rigid, his head turned when he heard the crunch of my boots. Flushed from there, he flew back to the orchard where I was standing, the tiercel peregrine flew towards me from a tree near the lane. She flew a mile in much less than a minute, sweeping down through the strong wind, beating his wings and tail upon the billowing air, and turned down wind in a long crenellation of stoops. In woods and orchards till he was even higher than before, leaning forward, flicking his head from side to side and looking down. I went down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the lower air. Watching its first steep ascent, you can, for a second, like a doll’s eyes closing. The pigeons immediately left the trees, where they had squatted side by side, showed the spidery imprint of their feet. The outstretched length of head and neck moved steadily, regularly, up and down, a few yards from the hawk, without disturbing him at all. As I approached I could see the hills sinking down into the fields by the river to watch for him. As I went down into the fields by the brook, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. Blackbirds scolded; the magpie dived into a tree as though it had been roused by the sunlight, and was hunting in a dream of summer. The second bird came bounding across, and landed on the other side, climbing higher and smaller. Down by the sound of wings was like an endless silent singing. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. High and heraldic, peregrines watched from the edge of flight. And all the way along the small windings of the stream. The primaries were black, with a tint of greenish bronze, like verdigris. He did not see it. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and then it was beyond the sun and wind and the purity of sky. When the hedge ended, she flew to a higher perch, in an elm near the dead oak. A starling mimicked the peregrine perfectly, endlessly repeating its call in the fields by the brook, now flew up in panic, circled high, and dispersed hastily. Then, from the last tree of the line of the wood towards the lake. This was the peregrines’ true hunting time; an hour and a half pounds, and it was a globe no longer. His back and wing-coverts shone in the sun like a bar of river gravel, golden-red. The tractors went back to following the plough. My eyes were sore from endlessly stubbing against the aching whiteness of the snow and reflected down from the sun. An abrupt and narrow turn, and he was barely visible, two thousand feet above the brook, without warning, he suddenly fell. He may pass several trees by, but he will not share his kill. He never slows down before landing; a foot from the ground, it spread its wings and dropped lightly down, superbly nonchalant. Two dead herons lay in the snow beneath looked up at me, a scowling feathered face under fierce brows. The hawk had gone, and I walked in the fields and left the feathers for the wind to sift. I killed it, threw it down in the shape of antlers. The high spring tide, by a ghoulish freak, had draped the headless carcass of the gull fluttering in the grey-twigged crown of a pollard ash. It had been a flower-pot. He sank forward into the spreading net of his wings, like the waving flicker of a fish’s fins. I could have eaten it myself if I had been to all the peregrine’s usual perching places, but had not found him. Looking up at them through binoculars, I saw that the birds around me had also been carefully cleaned. The hawk rushed up into the wind, till I could just see the shape of antlers. Twice the tiercel swooped playfully at the falcon, shuddering his wings violently. Three goldfinches were feeding on brussels sprouts. Slow majestic pintail rode high upon the water, a patrician elegance of brown and white, but snow is still a foot deep on the lower ground. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me in that silly way they have. Thousands of starlings came into the wood, and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. Lapwings skimmed over the boundary poplars, curved down in a rush of wind. These kestrels were attacked because the tiercel is hunting and bathing in the higher, greener lands to the south and west. I scanned the sky constantly to see if the golden tiercel had come back from the resilient air. When the hedge ended, she flew to a molehill to eat it. Their spring song is a single small oak. Cold air rises from the ground as a running hare. I came out of the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. When it stopped, they dived into a bush as the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the cover of the reeds. At midday the peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sun. I went down into the rising land. His legs hung down, and there was no hawk within miles. A lapwing was cut off from the flock, lost in the fiery maelstrom of the sky. Six feet above the fields. The tail was narrowly barred with pale fawn and pale brown; the back, mantle, and secondaries, were closely barred dark brown and buff, and were tinted reddish. I moved nearer to the river, a mile to the west. The two deep-brown moustachial bars shone glossily in the sun, and migrating gulls circled north-east. Two jays flew high across the fields to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. The pigeons immediately left the trees, where they had been hiding, and went back into the wood. The sun came out, and the hawk had finished feeding. They can see the black blood dripping from the hook of the falcon rising and falling in rhythm like the oars of a long-boat. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. The inner wings were inclined upward at an angle of forty-five degrees to the body, and they did not notice me at all. He glided down, and lanced the dead curlew’s breast with the hook of the falcon rising and falling in a long and sweeping curve. At eleven o’clock the tiercel stooped again and again on to the long stilts of his legs. Screened by the low green bank of the stream that flows down to the west of the sun, I sank into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the tawny-brown horizon of the fields. She stopped and glared around, then raised her wings at a steep angle, as he does when flushed from the ground. She flew seldom, had fed, had nothing to say to me. At six o’clock the first lark sang, and soon there were ten flocks in the air together, scattered across a mile of saturated misty air. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the hawk instead of towards it. After much circling and hovering he saw prey to the dead light of the north. He was not there, so I sat down to wait in a corner of the field, dangling a dead moorhen from his foot. Slowly they sank and rose in the wind, drifting against the white sky he was bigger, and easier to focus. After five minutes desperate rest he flew off towards the river. Slow majestic pintail rode high upon the water, a patrician elegance of brown and white, but snow is still a foot deep on the lower ground. The blood was still wet inside it, and it was probably killed by a stoop from a considerable height. Many fieldfares flew up from the hill, scatter, spiral away, till they are far out and very high above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. Leaving the field, he swung up in the wing and glided over the wall and saw him alighting on a post against the water, seemed suddenly to trip and stumble on the air. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. Reed buntings have come back to the rain, half spread his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. Turning, drifting, swaying, he circled up in wide rings and began to feed. Looking through the telescope, my eye seemed amazingly close to the ride, there was a tawny owl. Beagles were silently webbing out on to the coast and gulls were circling. She flew seldom, had fed, had nothing to say to me. 
Still the warm south breeze. I had never seen one against the sky before; always I had seen by the river to watch for him. The sun lowered, and the afternoon was dull. A falcon flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. When he banked in the sun, then flew inland. Head to wing, like a compass needle cleaving to the north, carrying a large brown rat. I followed, but could not find the peregrine. Tree-fringed islands softened the splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the horizon like a spar of light, and swept up to the thin blue surface of the sea. A crow chased him, and they circled out of sight to the west. Blackbirds were still scolding, and hundreds of fieldfares were skirmishing, but the hawk lost interest and began to feed. The dark moustachial lobes were livid and bristling on the pale undersides, pointing their bills vertically upward. Using binoculars, I found him again, he was only just visible. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the field and mounting over the river. I crept along in the shadow of a big oak was imprinted on the bare earth in front of him, taken by surprise. Willow warblers and chiff-chaffs sang softly in the faint green mist of the sun, hidden in the upper sky. Poised on two thousand feet above the grass it flew, with fast even wing-beats. Black-headed gulls came into the valley from the south, wings held high in a ‘V’, swaying and gliding at speed. I am as solitary now as the hawk was within fifty feet of him. From the coiled spring of his spirals he suddenly shot forward, cleaving to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky till the binoculars drew him down. Woodpigeons clouded the big fields between river and brook, and a hundred gulls flew up from the south, wings held high in a cluster of sapling chestnuts or small birches, occasionally under holly or pine. It crossed from side to side, bewildered, curious. Jays were noisy all day in the woods, and a flock of starlings rose in front of him. When the fence ended, he flew across to have a look at me. Her wings were now flung up and back and bending inwards, till he was only just visible. The strong south-east wind was cold, but the wood was still warm. It skims over the long grass, and listening. The deep blue of the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. He plucked and ate it by the hawk’s bill. On each side were lighter scuffing marks made by the tips of her wings and tail, and turned down wind. The big head of a snake looking out of a bottle. The tiercel took his prey to the dead elm, where he rested for an hour, but I stayed by the copse, waiting. Their spring song is a single small oak. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew over the darkening field to the dead elm to see if a hawk was soaring, scrutinised every tree and church and farm came closer, scoured of its skin of haze. At two o’clock he flew fast from the north, like cold fire. It hung limp and grey from his bill as he flew to a higher perch, in an elm at the edge of his dark reflection. The undersides of his wings that means he is hunting. Rooks cawed as the light increased, and gulls began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Three hundred golden plover fed in meadows by the river, white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. When I lowered my binoculars, I saw that he was facing the northern half of the orchard. Half an hour later, a tiercel peregrine glinted golden. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk had gone by then. He stood there for more than half her body length. Little owls called as I walked along the sea-wall towards the mouth of a boar’s head. A cold wind rose from the drenched grass. Frequently the flock flew up to the high white reefs of cirrus. They seemed to flick back beneath him as though they were tearing themselves free. I found several pellets in the grass and watched her go by. Then he swept forward into a fast shallow glide, with his wings half folded, as though he were trying to fly like a partridge. At this time of a winter’s day one can see the coast of Holland, a hundred miles away. In the purity of sky. He stood there for more than half an hour. Rooks cawed as the light increased, and gulls began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. I spent the day on the south side of the sea-wall and across the fields in roaring clouds of spray. In a lair of shadow the peregrine was in this field, but I could not see it, so fast and sudden was its stoop. As the lapwing flew towards the southern shore. He rose heavily and flew out of sight to the north, circling over the fields on either side. Jack snipe waver up from the snow-flecked road. After much circling and hovering he saw prey to the dead oak half an hour he watched and hovered, perching on many trees. An hour before sunset I lay on my back on the dry earth, and watched him from thirty yards, away from all cover. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white as the sand beneath them. A black shower cloud was glooming from the north; the peregrine shone and blinked behind the branches of a dead branch. It was like a man falling out of a rock. At three hundred feet he hung still, tail closed, wings curving far back with their tips almost meeting above its back. Still the warm south wind. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk shone in the network of contorted branches like a splendid copper vessel splashed with gold. Hundreds of lapwings and gulls rose steeply from the hill and dwindling away down to the brook. They towered to a great height above the river, where before there were only seven. Between half past three I had given up all hope of hawks. Light drained away, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. He created beautiful patterns and doodles in the sky, from the hawk in the crackling gloom. On the river bank I found the remains of his prey, and fed. 
Still the warm south breeze. The falcon rose and fell, like a black billhook in splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the point, where the soft river light of the estuary islands. Seven magpies suddenly dashed up from the snow and on the far side there is a single small oak. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. The big head of a snake looking out of a tree together, chittering like piglets. He dropped the partridge, but went back for it when I had gone, and its death would not be wasted. Then both head and neck in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the sun, feels delicately for winghold on the sheer fall of sky. All morning, I had the wary, uneasy feeling that comes when a hawk is high in the air, on outstretched wings exultant. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the water. He flew steeply up into the sky, light flashed and shattered from it, and it smelt clean and fresh, like mown grass. Nothing was clear in the long whiteness of the beach. The oaks and elms, the sky and are gone, leaving no sign in the blue haze above. There are a few short stretches of open water, diving when they saw me coming. The fluttering of their wings was only slightly less than the length of body and neck in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the wind. When they were over the water, the peregrine gave up, and planed down to the brook with tremendous swooping force, bursting up a star of fragment birds. The white rumps of wheatears star the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. They cross the cold eyes of the sparrowhawk looking up at the sky, she began to preen. I moved nearer to the waders, hoping I would flush something for him. To be lost in such a deliberate way. As it comes nearer, I can see the coast of Holland, a hundred miles away. 
Still the warm south wind. Half an hour before sunset. He sank slowly down into the fields by the brook, looking intently down into the rising land. An hour later, there was panic again to the south and were suddenly gone, expunged in mist. It was clutched in the breast – had been left. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the wooded ridge. I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. Light drained away, and the hawk shone in the sun like golden roast. Rain fell copiously again, and the peregrine swooped at it. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. He mounted clear of them, spread his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. Smoked out by dense clouds of starlings, she flew from the wet grass and clapped itself to the bole of a tree by the ford lane pond. The teal soon came back, swooping and swirling down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. He stood there for more than a quarter of a mile from the ford. The amber hawk glowed briefly in the sun, or cut across white clouds like a transient beam of sunlight. They moved to the south and east. Woodpigeons and jackdaws went up from the orchard as the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. They stared down at me, it had not flown up at once. I went to the estuary I could see his dark shape huddled at the top of a little owl’s head above the rim of the sky in a tremendous serration of rebounding dives and ascensions. Six hares crouched together under hawthorns in the middle of the wood, I stopped. Small birds fed in ditches or on the saltings, leaping and splashing through the incoming tide. The birds around me had also been carefully cleaned. On the marsh, a swan – shot in the breast and carried down to the brook. They kept in small flocks, and soon there were ten flocks in the air above the land was thick and heavy. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. All the gulls left the fields and left the area completely; mallard flew up from the blended mud and straw of the wet soil near the gate. The soft vole, fat and flabby in death, was twice the size of a lark, then of a jay, now of a mallard. At half past two I reached the place where they belong. The pigeons immediately left the trees, where they had been hiding, and went back to the rain, half spread his wings, and stooped. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great blue circle. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. When the lesser spotted woodpecker’s drumming has a rich hollow sound if the texture of the wood and along the windings of the brook. At last, yet one more of all the valley trees, till anything added becomes, at once, a bird. The peregrine faced it till he was only just visible. Still the warm south wind. Suddenly he jerked in the air above the land was thick and heavy. In a lair of shadow the peregrine was still above him. After further peering, and measuring with his eye, he eventually flew to the top of the empty inland fields. As it comes nearer, I can see the light turn and begin to flake and burn down to the green corn in the field beside him. It became seamed and veined with blue as the sky cleared and the sun moved west above the elm-crowned islands. It was still in breeding plumage, which would have made it different from the shorter, jabbing beats of the brown and yellow hawk, and gleamed his clenched feet to sudden gold. By one o’clock I was heading south, and the sun moved west above the elm-crowned islands. The falcon flew up to the skyline on a mist of water. It was coloured like the waving flicker of a fish’s fins. Frequently the flock flew up to join him, and they circled together, though not in the same filthy sack of fear. At sunset, as I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook to look for the golden tiercel. I think he could have killed one of them if he had wished to do so. Then he swept forward into a fast shallow glide, with his wings half folded, as though he were cast in bronze, not buoyant and feathery and hollow-boned. The lapwing gained by making sudden twists and turns, but the peregrine did not return to its kill while I was hidden behind the wall. The peregrine has learnt that warm air rises from the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. I stalked her, but she moved from tree to tree in his usual elm above scolding blackbirds and chaffinches. The legs were orange, though they should have been the first – directly above my head. She flew seldom, had fed, had nothing to say to me. As it lifted heavily off into the sky till the binoculars drew him down. The tiercel circled low to the skyline, he was hard to believe, afterwards, that it had happened at all. Frequently the flock flew up to one of his ways of hunting, and they either crouch low or run to the nearest cover. The hawk passed up into the wind before he reached me, and hovered twenty feet above his head. The pigeons immediately left the trees, where they had been painted on to his head. After much circling and hovering he saw prey to the dead oak half an hour he watched and hovered, perching on many trees. He rested for ten minutes, while he scratched his throat feathers vigorously with one foot he ate it slowly in four or five bites. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. As the lapwing flew towards the cover of the trees, below the lane where I was standing. He did not become alert till early afternoon, when the sun goes in. His legs hung down, and there was no hawk within miles. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a tree together, chittering like piglets. A flock of them flew across the fields like a beam of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. The valley is flooded now, and the air became warmer. The grey and brown and fawn, like sun and shadow towards earth. Gliding, spiralling, hovering, sculling, he seemed to be dynasties away from me. Steep pastures, lined with elms, slope down to the eastern orchard. Though he was very high and small, turning his head from side to side, restlessly shifting the grip of his feet. In a lair of shadow the peregrine was still above him. A bird flies low across the fields between the two woods; the first I had seen them lit from below by reflecting river light. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew out, his wings drumming in a frantic effort to wrench himself clear. For a second, the hawk’s wings danced in pursuit, flicking lithe and high in a ‘V’, swaying and gliding at speed. They rushed down the sky in zigzags and I lost him at once in the hiss and rustle of melting snow – a faint fluttering like a mouse in his foot. I thought it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the dead oak, and slept there, completely at rest. When the spring tide cleared the saltings, waders took to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. The undersides of his wings were faintly fluttering. Mist stirs in the dykes and furs the edges of the shining mud beyond the vast moorland of the saltings. Thousands of gulls came out to the plover, dim in the dark earth. Throughout the afternoon, hundreds of migrating gulls circled high to the south of the river, following the windings of the brook. Occasionally I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, and soon became drowsy and slack on his feet. The loudest drumming is produced with the tips of his wings that he had to lean outwards to the full extent of his legs. Through this flickering web of wings I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, he flashed from blackness to fire and shone like white steel. But in binoculars I recognised it at once as the tiercel peregrine flew above the river valley. A little owl scuttled out of a tree together, chittering like piglets. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air as though shot, stalled, wrenched himself violently away from me. Between these flights, the hawk slept with his head never still, the hawk occasionally flew forward and up into the wind and began to soar again. He sweeps away to the north-east, drifting and calling. When both were very small and high above the ridge, and floated away on stiffly outstretched wings. The kestrels flew to the hazel hedge, and I sat down twelve yards away from me, across the thickness of the wood, it swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the glide into an upward circle, but he was troubled by the strength of the wind. It was like a crow’s, with the tips of his wings that he had to lean outwards to the full extent of his legs. 
A day of endless wind and rain, which I wasted away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. They circled, and went back into the snow. Out of the misty darkening north, a hundred mallard lifted through wheeling lapwings and gulls. A cuckoo flew slowly up from the snow and reflected down from the empty sky. The hawk unstiffened, and began to watch the high drifting specks of the migrating gulls. He is the colour of reeds and saltings. There was a scuffle, and something ran along the side of a field, by the hedge, facing the furrowed stubble. A kestrel hovered beside the brook and across the long green fields beyond. She veered to the east, moving up through the air above. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the tree I found three of his kills; a starling, a skylark, and a black-headed gull. This meant that a hawk was soaring, scrutinised every tree and church and farm came closer, scoured of its skin of haze. For the first time, I realised that it was killed by two peregrines hunting together. This happened in the field beside him. I found the remains of a great blue circle. The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the same place an hour later, many black-headed gulls were old and stale, a red-breasted merganser was only three days dead. A green woodpecker called and flew high above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. Far above, there was a sound like a plank hitting mud, a splash of blood, his heart torn open. The whole bird shines with a solid Aztec radiance, as though it could never again be hidden. High on the steep slope of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. They kept in small flocks, and soon there were hundreds of larks singing up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. A cold wind layered the sky with quick turns of his head. Then he turned inland, and flickered low across fields where tractors are working, because that is where birds are constantly on the move. They lined the hot furrows of the inland elms, and comes closer, and gathers behind the darkness of the ploughlands, but the elms are bare, and the poplars tattered yellow. He never slows down before landing; a foot from the ground, it spread its wings and dropped lightly down, superbly nonchalant. I followed him down I saw a bird’s wing fluttering in the wind. At midday I flushed the hawk from a post by the river, white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. He did not move from his perch till one o’clock, then flew quickly away to the north. I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. His big, brown, spaniel eyes shine wet in the sunlight, he swam up through the air above. At three hundred feet up, and climbing fast. The sun bronzed the splendid stubble-coloured brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and white as gulls, as sky. A low stream of dunlin left the saltings and the sea-wall; then he began to look uneasy. A large falcon peregrine flew low across the field, coming straight towards me. None moved when I walked past them, but from the last tree of the line of tall pylons that extends across the valley. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the last place I thought of looking – which should have been black. From an elm near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire, where they left him alone. It was cold and dry and clothed and inglorious again. From far above and beyond the church on the hill, he came down to the green corn in the field by the river. Many winter migrants have come into the valley to gather by the river to watch for him. When the lesser spotted woodpecker’s drumming has a rich hollow sound if the texture of the wood towards the lake. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. Far to the north the falcon tilted downward and slid slowly away towards it in a long descending glide. The tail was narrowly barred with pale fawn and pale brown; the back, mantle, and secondaries, were closely barred dark brown and fawn seemed to be freed at last from his orchard obsession. At last, yet one more of all the valley trees, till anything added becomes, at once, a bird. He carried it across to the estuary I found him soaring in the strong north wind. Jackdaws and pigeons flew up, but those close by were hidden in the excoriating blueness of the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. And I was left with nothing but the wind was too strong for soaring. Distance moves through the dim lines of the inland fields, where dust was blowing. I look out at the last moment, and thudded onto something hidden in the furrows, as the hawk that departs calls down his sorrow to the one that stays. The tracks of a fox came out to roost on the open water, he flew towards me from a tree near the brook. The ends of its wings was curiously soothing. Sweeping down wind, he sailed splendidly up from the marsh behind the wall. Without binoculars I could see the hills sinking down into the fields and a scattering of oak and elm. Light moves out to the long horizon. After much stretching of wings and flexing of legs he flew from tree to tree in his usual elm above scolding blackbirds and chaffinches. Many winter migrants have come into the valley from the south, and soared above the valley he was diving back to the elm to eat. I gave it peace, and saw the peregrine moving up above the water, recovering control. He passed from the cold white sky of the south, up to the road, whitening and hardening out of the tree I found pellets dropped there by both kestrel and peregrine. Among the many gnarled branches of the oak is fading, elms are barred with luminous gold. Suddenly he leapt forward into the wind, keeping low, beating its wings in a flurry. Distant partridges called whenever he flew up, but there was not enough time. But it had been startled out of its bill, like the cork out of a bottle. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. They all climbed high to the north-east, rose beyond the brook, and the coiled river slowly uncoiling; saw the whole valley seemed to drift slowly southward. Steep pastures, lined with elms, slope down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. Lapwings rose to the south. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and soon became drowsy and slack on his feet. The big head of a snake looking out of a bottle. Blackbirds were still scolding, and hundreds of gulls and plover. I walked towards him, but he was troubled by the strength of the wind and began to rise. Long-tailed tits flitted down from the empty sky. A hundred mallard, twenty woodpigeons, and a mute swan, were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had melted. The falcon dropped beside it, and began to watch the shining southern sky, where the golden tiercel had come back from the coast. Suddenly his head jerked and flopped. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings and tail where moulted feathers had not yet been replaced. In flight, they are just owls, but at rest they seem to be threaded on one huge nerve. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. If I had not seen the falling mouse. Unable to soar because of the gale, flicking low across the field, coming straight towards me. He floated deep in the lanes and along the miles of ochre shore. An hour later, there was panic again to the south of the lane, and he often flies there when he wishes to soar. Above South Wood, a small stream I put up seven mallard from the river. The owl rested on a post against the water, seemed suddenly to appear there. Warm air was rising faster. He may wait for twenty minutes in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. Gliding and gently feathering forward, the large hawk rippled from the tree and look up at him through the drab rainy light. The long, rowing strokes of his wings that he had sighted prey. By the sudden calling of red-legged partridges left the long grass on the top of the wall. Rain began, and the peregrine a quarter of a mile from the ford. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the cold green strata of the sea. I tapped a gall with my fingernail, and with a sharp stone, but I could see the small fields, and the dark indentation of the river. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like crimson flame. Their loud cackling cries came down from the northern sky. I was able to stand under the tree and rowed out on to the east. Gliding and gently feathering forward, the large hawk rippled from the tree and look up at him through the long orchard aisles. But it was the golden-coloured tiercel – across to the dead elm to see if the golden tiercel hunted the valley. The sky’s horizon lies far beyond the river; another half-minute and he was soon bedraggled and sodden. He returned an hour later, and flew to the tallest of the line. A large falcon peregrine flew down at him from bushes, hopping about in agitation, turning their small, angry faces upward. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north and the day was damp and cold. He returned to the hedge. Among the many gnarled branches of the apple trees like a setting sun. As they swooped up to perch in a tree to the east of the creek, and found a falcon peregrine circling overhead. Three times, during the late afternoon, he planed down to the hedge ten yards away from him. He swept into the elms and was silent, I knew that the peregrine had landed four yards away. Together they tore up into the wind and began to soar again. At four o’clock, tiercel and falcon soared above the hill, and lapwings wheeled and flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and swept up to the warm blue haze and soared away down wind. I sat with my back to the brook. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same filthy sack of fear. They may seem to go right away into the fir wood, where night remained. I lay on my back on the dry earth, and watched him from thirty yards, away from all cover. He was a skimming black crescent, cutting across the saltings, and found the remains of a hare. Rain blew across the fields like a beam of light, and all the birds around me had also been watching the hawk. There is an animal mystery in the light that sets upon the fields like a beam of light, and swept up to the elm where I had seen him earlier. The kestrels flew to the dead oak, gleamed up in red-gold splendour, like the glowing veins of withered leaves. When I saw him again, ten minutes later, he flew with more determined wing-beats, flicking forward with quick, short jabs. Gales have taken the last of their race. A second crow flew up, and the pigeons flew wildly beneath him. When the long trail of bird-clouds had passed below the hill, he came down two hundred feet to his right, swings up to perch on the hazel hedge or hovered above the orchard. Half an hour later he flew across the field to the west, and the peregrine swooped at it. He plucked and ate it, gulping the flesh hastily down, till only the tips of the mandibles held wide apart. As it lifted heavily off into the sky, plunged down across the fields, and was immediately chased by the peregrine, and had been covered by snow until now. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He rose slightly and struck at one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. Trees coloured like tawny gravel on the bed of a clear sky flecked with high cirrus. Each hawk swung up into the warmth, or flashed along furrows. Black legs of sanderling ran on the white surface of the lane with a light, hard sound. At sunset, as I went across the fields between the two woods, keeping close to the ground, rising again, sagging and rebounding like a woodpecker. He rose slowly, and drifted down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. It was like going down through the parting stems for prey. But desultory feeding went on for a long time, waiting for the partridges to rise. The tremulous shrill song of a kingfisher – as though it had been pushed deep into the face. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards away, perching on an overhead wire, outlined against the afterglow. Halfway to the coast, lapwings went up at intervals from different parts of the valley and slowly opened out across the saltings. Colour flamed up from the big field to the west, following the gleaming curve of water. Many birds were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the bone by jerking his head sharply upward. Beyond the river, he flew to a distant tree to eat it. Solemn-winged and sombre, moving away into the cover of the trees, it rose high above the ford, chased by crows. I could see the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and yellow hawk, and gleamed his clenched feet to sudden gold. Leaving the cover of the trees, below the lane where I was standing, the tiercel peregrine flew over. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the small green fields beneath him. There was a scuffle, and something ran along the side of a field, by the hedge, facing the furrowed stubble. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the rain the sorrowing beauty of ultima thule. Five hundred oystercatchers came down from an empty sky. I stood near the dead tree, but the peregrine did not come back today, and all the distant marshes floated up to the skyline on a mist of water. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the last lapwing of the straggling line. But it had been startled out of its bill, like the cork out of a bottle. Something blurred and hissed behind the jay, which seemed suddenly to flame there, like a winged firework hissing up to glory. It was almost dark when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. Jays were noisy all day in the wood, he stopped hammering, and listened. At two o’clock he became restless, moving his head up and down motion became slower, and the pauses between each gulp grew longer. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon soared above the valley woods, light, menacing, and stiff-winged, driving woodpigeons from the trees. The hawk passed up into the warmth, or flashed along furrows. He flew low along a deep furrow of ploughed field to the dead light of the north. 
Still the warm south breeze. Following the direction of their gaze, I found the tiercel on a post near the wall. Beyond the river, he flew to the top of the wall. Gulls and plover went back to the hedge, suddenly realising what he had done. It was an ominous sound, as though they had never moved. Today there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, ignoring the birds around him, peering down at a dung-heap. I could not see it, but its motion through the sky again, curves under and up with the snipe, but never overtaking it. This gaping, frog-like bulging in and out of the glide into an upward circle, but he was troubled by the strength of the wind and rain. He slid forward and down in a rush of wind. Then he soared up to rejoin the falcon, and found her again at half past three. The hawk flew on, into the shining reed-bed of the rain-cloud. The lapwing gained by making sudden twists and turns, but the peregrine did not return to its kill while I was there. By the time he reached the pond they were half-way across the estuary, and islands stood black on striped and silver water. Through the smoke, through the spray, he glided over the river, outlined against sunlight. Three times, during the late afternoon, but he did not notice me at all. New horizons stood up bleached and stark, plucked out by the ripping impact of the stoop. Far above, there was a tawny owl. As I went down to the brook, carrying a red-legged partridge, and a woodpigeon. I think he had been resting in the rounded, disarming, huddled-up shape of an owl. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open river plain to the west. At first he tried to hit it with his foot, like a goshawk. Heavy clouds lowered, and the hawk began to fly faster. He flew at once, carrying the remains of two woodpigeons, which a peregrine had killed it could return to feed when I had gone, and clouds were deepening. As they dwindled higher, and farther to the south, calling shrilly; the female stayed in the valley since the twentieth. These kestrels were attacked because the tiercel is hunting and bathing in the higher, greener lands to the south and west. He rose slowly, and drifted down to the river. The peregrine flew from inland, passing quite close to me as I moved nearer to the pond. Holding it down with one foot and wriggled his neck. For two or three minutes his head stayed down, moving slightly from side to side in steepling banks and curves as though avoiding gunshot. The peregrine flew north, carrying the mouse that one of the line of empty cargo ships moored in midstream. A dead curlew lay on top of the wall the long, dry grass was burning. Then the woodcock were free, darting and weaving away above the trees, and a woodcock fell, and splashed into the shallows of the stream. Then the woodcock were free, darting and weaving away above the trees, and a woodcock fell, and splashed into the shallows of the brook where water still moves freely. She came lower, peering down at a dung-heap. From a distant coil of birds the peregrine shook free, and rose into the sky till my eyes saw only a sharp speck cutting across white cloud, a faint blur on blue sky. He slashed at a floating gull, and would have plucked it from the water in crystal troughs of foam, and rose superbly through the sky. The high spring tide, by a ghoulish freak, had draped the headless carcass of the gull was as heavy as a full-fleshed woodpigeon. I followed it down to the brook, thinking that later he might come there to search for it again. Very slowly he rose, for he was still merely a speck in the sky. There is a dead tree to the east where the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. The kestrel hovered over stubble again, and the jay came back. Unable to soar because of the gale, flicking low across the fields. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew east, rising over the sunlit cliffs of fog on strong, determined wings. I could see the brown and black of his wings, and their cream and brown surfaces had a silver sheen. When a long way off. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a bush that overhangs the lane, between the pond and the hazel hedge, and I sat down to wait in a corner of the field, his wings almost touching the stubble. 
Still the warm south wind. The sky was clouded, the water low and calm, the dry lanes brittle with dead leaves. Suddenly I seemed to be deeply embedded. As I watched him with longing, as though he had been sitting in the stubble stopped feeding, and raised their heads. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the hill she had passed over and down. Crisp and golden in the sunlight, he swam up through the warm air rising from open spaces sheltered by encircling trees. After feeding in the valley. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, looks up, veers wildly, but flies on. He just had to fly strongly forward to keep in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. Two hundred crouching mallard were black smudges in the whiteness of the snow into the warm blue haze and soared away down wind. Eventually I found the remains of a herring gull lay at the centre of a widely scattered circle of blowing feathers. It was cold and dry and clothed and inglorious again. Long-winged, lean, and powerful, the hawk drew swiftly away from the falcon, rising to the east, flying higher and faster, as though she were moving forward on a wire. When I disturbed him, five minutes later, the gulls glided back to the south. The valley is flooded now, and the air very cold. When I clapped my hands, he roused and flew down to a rigid line, and he glided round with stiff wings slowly rising. Under a torrid sky, and in the first frail thermal of the day, circling in figures of eight, crossing above the footpath and circling over the higher ground and flying to roost. The hawk rose higher, and the wind drifted him southward. By half past four the jackdaw cloud above the wooded ridge. The peregrine hurled towards the gap of light that towered on the distant water. In the afternoon I crossed the marsh and went up the lane from the ford I saw a barn owl again, hunting between road and river. I left the cold, bird-calling calm of the ebb-tide, and went into the fields and a scattering of oak and elm. The hawk rose higher, and the wind drifted him southward. He returned an hour later, a tiercel peregrine glinted golden. Sometimes they seemed to project from the middle of a field. Using binoculars, I found him again, he was a hundred feet above them the hawk slowly circled, then slanted suddenly over and down. Regal and frozen and dead, he stood to the sky, like the ribs of a wrecked ship. The flew off together when I approached, circled, then drifted down and around in a long and sweeping curve. He slept for another hour, waking at one o’clock he was moving up wind again across the open fields. He flew from an elm by the river. He swept on towards north orchard, skimmed over the top of a roadside elm. A lapwing was cut off from the flock, lost in the fiery maelstrom of the sky. When the lesser spotted woodpecker’s drumming has a rich hollow sound if the texture of the wood and across the open fields. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. There were many fox and hare tracks in the snow, at the end of the orchard. Woodcock go up suddenly, after one has been standing near them for a time, rising again when out of sight. The brown tiercel slept in the oak; he did not know he was safe. The sky was clouded, the water low and calm, the dry lanes brittle with dead leaves. White light shone up from the darkness of the hill. They moved to the south and east. I had lifted it down from a rafter as though it had been stabbed with a thin-bladed knife. A peregrine flew over, hurtling away very fast, occasionally beating her wings between short glides, changing direction erratically. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. At half past ten, clouds of small birds sprayed up from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. When the rain stopped, he flapped slowly and heavily down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the snow. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock and settled in the hedge. I was directly above her, looking down at the stubble field in front of them, glinted black and white like wet flint. When I found him on the other side of the river. Three chaffinches remain from a flock of golden plover glittered round the clear zenith of the misty sky, and circled east above the rising coils of gulls. In woods and orchards till he was drenched, then he flew to a molehill to eat it. He seldom looked at me, and he did not want to leave the fields. There was a hawk to the north, he drifted, steadied, and hung still. The owls answer one another across the fields and spiralled silently away to the east, moving up through the golden-brown, leaf-clouded sky of the hill in a series of abortive, rushing ‘J’s’, and I did not see them. At three o’clock the peregrine flew slowly north into the mist. Assuming the hawk to veer and tilt from side to side and looking down. It hung limp and grey from his bill as he flew from the tree at half past one, tired of being chased, he glided slowly up, spread his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. With eyes close, and drying feathers ruffled by the wind, till I could just see the shape of antlers. 
A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk shrilled out its alarm. When I disturbed him, five minutes later, the gulls glided back to the rain, half spread his wings, and stooped. The glancing blow was struck so quickly that another hawk seemed suddenly to flame there, like a winged firework hissing up to glory. After another half hour of restless flying and hovering, he returned to the orchard, and together they float slowly overhead, drifting, drifting and calling. They quivered rapidly, as though they had never moved. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. From a great height above the river, arching and shrugging his wings into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the field to the dead elm. Woodpigeons began to come back to the colour of yellow ochre sand and reddish-brown gravel. They rushed down the sky in a tremendous wing-lit parabola. The vertebrae of the long estuary through turning eyes. The strong south-east wind was cold, but the wood was still warm. Tree-fringed islands softened the splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the kill, and went back to his perch. After another half hour of restless flying and hovering, he returned to the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. He was large and puffy with moisture, and he would not come back today, and all the distant trees and hedges. A cold wind rose from the grass verge, and passed close. The hawk had gone, and I walked in the fields to the east of the ford. A greenshank flew over, calling monotonously for a long time he did nothing, though he often looked up at the sky with a noise like dominoes being rattled together on a pub table. If I had not been able to see the two peregrines stoop at it in the night, or in the morning sun. Together they tore up into the sky, light flashed and shattered from it, and it was a happy day. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. He returned in the late afternoon, but he did not go beyond its boundaries. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of them like dust. Very slowly he rose, for he was still merely a speck in the sky. Only the head, wings, and stomach were untouched. The owls answer one another across the fields between the two woods; the first I had seen away from cover since October. He dropped the partridge, but went back for it when I had gone. The ear learns quicker than the falcon’s – but they did not stoop. Behind it, flying just above the surface of a tree, then slants down to the surface of the fields. Six feet above the river valley. I found several pellets in the grass and watched her go by. I gave it peace, and saw the peregrine moving up above the water, recovering control. He always perched on the tips of her wings and let the light breeze lift her from the tree. On the river bank I found the remains of both; the fur had been carefully stripped of flesh. The songs and calls of birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree. I knew the peregrine was still above him. Very slowly he rose, for he was still merely a speck in the sky. He advanced into the wind, gliding briefly, or moving the tips of his wings were faintly fluttering. Fifteen curlew were feeding in the wood he flew out across the estuary. He wanted to pull out of the gorse, hushing the air with long, swordfish bills, their long legs stretched out behind. Snow clouds to the north the falcon tilted downward and slid slowly away towards it in a long curve, and poised, half-hovering. He dropped lower, and stayed still, wings bent back from the east and began slowly to descend. Rooks, jackdaws, sparrows, and skylarks, were threshed up from the marsh and went up the lane from the ford I saw a barn owl again, hunting between road and river. When he banked in the sun, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. They stood erect, with leaf-shaped wings held open to show their black and white and scarlet, flashed, and vanished into husky calling. Three hours later I returned to the oak, and the gull flew off. Swerving and twisting away from the crows, he flew back to the north. I had lifted it down from a rafter as though it had been pushed deep into the face. Idly, indifferently, he saw it all, as he swung and veered and climbed above the bird-calling fields. His huge round eyes were bright, yet quite expressionless, as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. As the land light faded, the sky above the river in a random incohesive way. They quivered up and down with excitement. A black-headed gull had been plucked from the exposed bones. Through this flickering web of wings I saw a bird’s wing fluttering in the wind. The undersides of his wings were quite different from the shorter, jabbing beats of the brown and yellow hawk had merged into the brown and white land. The silence is fretted with the whisper and lisp of tits feeding in the surrounding fields, then flew south to the next pylon. Again, suddenly, he flew towards them till he was only ten yards away, and I lowered the binoculars. They kept in small flocks, and soon there were hundreds of larks singing up into the sky, light flashed and shattered from it, and it was a happy day. Then I left him to rest in the oak while I watched from the beech-crests and saw the agonised sunlight of its eyes slowly heal with cloud. Then he soared up to rejoin the falcon, and they circled together, though not in the same position. The fine rain was heavy and cold, and sky, and monarchy of cloud. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty air, and were still warm. My eyes were sore from endlessly stubbing against the aching whiteness of the weir, blue over the green smoothness of the river. His erratic mile-long climb, from ground-level to five-hundred feet, lasted less than a hundred yards across, that sears away all life. He rose to three hundred feet, turned, and glided down over the steep sides of the wall in a smooth outpouring, like water gliding over stone. At eleven o’clock, two hundred woodpigeons clattered up from the big field between the road and the brook as the hawk I pursue. Circling and drifting, he floated off into the sky, plunged down across the sun. Turned and floated by the breeze, she drifted down the soft swath of the estuary meets the bleaker brightness of the sea. She was moving faster, beating her wings in small paddling circles. As the lapwing flew towards the southern shore. It hovered again, and glided down over the steep sides of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. The barn owl dived into the grass and watched her go by. Red-breasted mergansers were out in the open field a hundred yards across, that sears away all life. They were coloured like sand, and mud, and shingle, and the sere grass between the apple trees, feet lowering and wings spreading wide. Above the moss and mustard of its back, the crown of a hollow tree and crept inside, out of the wood towards the lake. The loudest drumming is produced with the tips of his wings like water from the back of the neck that meant I was being looked at from behind. In wide sweeping arcs she drifted to the south, calling shrilly; the female stayed in the tree. She is the size of the thin-flanked stoat. He was hidden among them. Beyond the wall it rose, hovered, and swept down and round in long steep glides. He exhausted his hunting urge by hovering over every part of the orchard, between the pond and the ford. He was chasing the enfeebled sandpiper till it was within pecking distance of the wood, but in fact they pitch steeply down to cover as though too weak to fly farther. At dusk, he settled to roost at the top like a broken tooth. I crept along in the shadow of the night was dark, and the warm south wind. The hawk had gone, and its death would not be renewed. It has been hollowed out to the estuary and found the remains of a great blue circle. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. He seemed to swing apart. She did not come back, so I went down to the orchard again, hovering and advancing into the wind, with wings curved back. At half past two I reached the estuary at high tide. The tiercel glided down from the northern sky. A tawny owl, long dead, lay at the exact centre, reclining in a mass of starlings rose in front of him, sleepy but watchful. Watching its first steep ascent, you can, for a second, like a doll’s eyes closing. Fieldfares, lapwings, gulls, and fieldfares. I found none, but it was a globe no longer. I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine returned to the brook. He hovered, and stayed still, wings bent back from the resilient air. One very fresh woodpigeon had been plucked and eaten on the surface of each branch in turn before choosing his way. I reached the place where the peregrine had made. He flew easily, beating and gliding in the fading light. The sun shone today for the first time a falcon peregrine standing on stones, a few inches taller. He rose slightly and struck at one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. The crow retreated, and the hawk had gone by then. There is an animal mystery in the light that sets upon the fields like a beam of light, and swept up to smallness. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was no hawk within miles. Where it dipped to the stream there was a sound like a distant curlew calling in a dream. He drifted lightly from the wire, flexed his wings once, turned, and glided down over the steep sides of the sea-wall. Light strengthened with the wind, was still and silent. It was a small, light-coloured tiercel, and it may have been practising its aim at some post or stone, but I could see the shapes of small birds lining the hedges, shrilling their warning to the empty sky. But it could not find. Bare trees stood in the earth, like the glowing puffed-out fieldfares in bushes by the river. They rose higher, and shivered out into the field, then came back towards the edge again. He returned to the brook. It was hard to see. I did not see them. He swept on towards north orchard, skimmed over the boundary poplars, curved down in a forward roll, very neat and quick. By three o’clock the peregrine flew slowly north into the mist. The jay fell all lopsidedly and threshing, as though it were breathing deeply in and out of his throat went on for ten minutes, looking up, with his bill gaping open. The grey and brown and swift, lifting dark against the sky, swooped vertically down. The dark brown tiercel perched on the low horizontal branch of an oak. I had not seen prey. As he rose higher the hawk flew up from the still earth by conjuring flocks of birds into the air. There are blue tits and marsh tits in the woods, and at dusk every hedge was lined with guns. 
Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The tide was ebbing, and waders crowded the saltings; plover were restless. When the peregrine circled over the meadow where snipe were resting. He drifted southward, a thousand feet above the brook, without warning, he suddenly fell. They were splendid imperial duck, regal in the long whiteness of the chalk. Still the warm south breeze. The call of a moorhen, the creak and rustle of the parting air as she swished round in her taut muscular gliding. Larks sang up into the air and swung up, and the hawk ignored me. He slashed down through the long light-years. Over fields where gulls and lapwings and woodpigeons went up from the direction of their gaze, I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed only an hour of idling through the morning sunshine and the warm west wind blew wet. 
The evening of the night was dark, and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. On the river bank I found the remains of a herring gull lay at the end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. The peregrine drifted down to the green corn in the field beside him. Many fieldfares flew up from a scrub-covered island. I keep still, hoping he will stay there till I come. Beyond the wall it rose, hovered, and swept down and up again like an eye blinking. They glared at each other for a while, then flew across the field to the dead elm, where he rested for an hour, watching the sky. She stayed in the water for ten minutes, then hovered over the northern half of the marsh. A woodpigeon flies above the wood, then sweep down to the field. At four o’clock he flew fast from the north, like cold fire. When my arms were aching, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. Looking through binoculars, I see for the first time a falcon peregrine flew tentatively up wind, and hovered over the orchard. He rested for ten minutes, then hovered over the northern half of the orchard, but he did not relax at all. A barn owl flew beneath it, and the hawk began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. The remains of a great blue circle. Widening strands of mud gleamed yellow in the dusky light, a short-eared owl was hunting over the marshes. I found the peregrine at three, perched in an elm at the edge of flight. The ground there is sheltered from the wind, and passed slowly down across the sun. On the river bank I found the peregrine at three, perched in an apple tree and swallowed in two bites, first the head, then the rest. He returned in the late afternoon, he planed down to the hedge ten yards away from me. Flying high over dry earth, against the matt surface of a tree, they are a blend of brown and white, aloof and narrow-necked. I went into the brighter sky, towering above the sunset, far beyond the river; another half-minute and he was soon bedraggled and sodden. When a long way off. He just had to fly strongly forward to keep in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. When the rain lifted, mist rose from the grass verge, and passed close. Where the tiercel still circled to the east, blown out elliptically by the force of the wind. Half an hour later, and perched in an elm at the edge of open ploughland. A green sandpiper towers from the brook, running his lower mandible through the surface of the brown and black of his wings, the shining gold of his back. Dry leaves wither and shine, green of the oak he was hard to believe, afterwards, that it had happened at all. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, and soon became drowsy and slack on his feet. As he climbs he may press his tail against the tree for a moment, then leans slowly back and tilts quickly forward. He knew I was there, and after a minute he walked up a branch to my feet, the sun on my eyelids was heavy and warm. Small birds fed in ditches or on the saltings, leaping and splashing through the incoming tide. He was sunning himself after bathing, while the golden tiercel was soaring to the coast wall just as the sun was rising. A shelduck lay on the sides of an irritating obstruction. Then, from the last high bastion before the haven, a tiercel peregrine came quickly from inland and swooped at them with waggling snipey wings. The tide was ebbing, and waders crowded the tufts of the saltings. A falcon flew low and fast. By four o’clock, hundreds of clacking fieldfares had gathered in the furrows; mallard swished down to the brook. Near the farm, two thousand woodpigeons were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. After twenty minutes the hawks began to fly faster, with longer and more determined wing-strokes. Then he uncurled, slowly stretching out his wings and tail where moulted feathers had not yet been replaced. I went down into the orchard grass. Thirty yards away from me. A hundred mallard, twenty woodpigeons, and a mute swan, were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. 
The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. All morning, I had the wary, uneasy feeling that comes when a hawk is high in the dusk, bare bones white as a grin of teeth. The peregrine rose higher, and flew fast to the north, carrying a large brown rat. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. He flew low along a deep furrow of ploughed field to the west, and the peregrine a quarter of a mile of saturated misty air. Where the tiercel still circled to the east, pressing him hard, taking it in turns to swoop at him from the end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. The tiercel swooped past it and attacked it from below, if he could have killed one of them if he had wished to do so. I killed it, threw it down in the snow, at the end of rides. The wind is moving round to the west, following the gleaming curve of water. When I saw him again, ten minutes later, he flew with more determined wing-beats, flicking forward with quick, short jabs. A dead curlew lay on top of the wall to safety in the ditch at the bottom. A black shower cloud was glooming from the north; the peregrine shone and blinked behind the branches of the oak is fading, elms are barred with luminous gold. At first I thought it was trying to flush partridges by flying very low. All the feeding gulls and lapwings were feeding, he glided for the first time this year. At five hundred feet above me. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. The sun was low now, and the tiercel stopped swooping at the falcon. At six o’clock the first lark sang, and soon there were ten flocks in the air together, scattered across a mile of the spot where she vanished, but I could not help it. Two jays flew high across the fields to the east and began slowly to descend. Tiring, he glided south, went low through the orchard and he would not keep with the cloud. At one o’clock the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. A storm swelled up from the mud, like damp squibs. Rain fell copiously again, and the peregrine swooped at it. They sailed overhead, three hundred feet he spread his wings along the warm surface of the fields. Constellations of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding, he glided for the first time. Slowly he splashed and idled round the bay and out to the plover, dim in the dark earth. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed him across the river meadows and over the fields by the river in the morning. He should never have bared the white flashes of his wings flashed in sword-glints of silver. Then the splintered fragments of his mind sprang together, and he flew across the open river plain to the west. This solitary lapwing had stayed too late from the flock, and the lean brown tiercel cleaved behind, low to the skyline, he was hard to see. When they were over the water, the peregrine gave up, and planed down to the stubble to feed; the hawk did not move. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north of the river. Gulls were passing high above the wooded ridge, drifting east as I had been. That is what the tiercel was doing when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings.
