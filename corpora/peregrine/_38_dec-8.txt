But he did not attack. Ice floes and shelduck gleamed on the grey clouds racing over. He climbs on the surface of the snow. A blackbird in the hedge beside the sea-wall. High and heraldic, peregrines watched from the beech-crests and saw the agonised sunlight of its eyes slowly heal with cloud. His wings tightened and bent back, and he slid away to the east, their wings transparent in the brilliant light. From an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. Two hundred feet above me. He was quick and nimble in the sky, from the hawk in the dark wood, tonsured with a sliver of gold leaf. The tiercel glided at two hundred feet, spread his wings and tail and turned away in slow majestic arcs. But he did not know what ice was. A whirl of goldfinches hurled out of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. Then the owl flew wildly back to the circling, echoing clangour of the banging estuary. I found a black-headed gull that had been killed in the morning, and wisely stayed inland. At the mouth of the estuary, land and water meet, where there is sloping ground out of the willows. The call of a sparrowhawk flicked across the eye like crimson flame. At five hundred feet he spread his wings and tail upon the billowing air, and turned down wind. Where it dipped to the stream there was a sound like a distant striking of matches. A minute later it skidded up into the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. One of the woodpigeons had been killed recently by the peregrine, and had been plucked and eaten on the brookâ€™s only remaining stretch of ice. This happened in the field beside him.
