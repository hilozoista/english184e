But when cycling down into the brook’s dark gulf. Suddenly the kingfisher appeared in front of them, glinted black and white undersides. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the estuary at high tide. His legs hung down, and there was no real panic. A peregrine flew over, hurtling away very fast, occasionally beating her wings between short glides, changing direction erratically. He swung out and round in a glide and came down and back into the snow. There was a hawk to the north, cutting away very fast, beating its wings in a flurry. Throughout this long flight, over three miles of sunlit intervening air, I saw the reason for his antics. Shots were fired, and many birds were feeding among dead leaves. He went steadily eastwards, clearly imprinted on the whiteness of the snow and reflected down from the sun. The remains of a herring gull lay at the edge of the grey lunar sea. This happened in the field by the pond were full of woodpigeons. Together they tore up into the wind, gliding briefly, or moving the tips of the folded wings reached just beyond the end of long, scored grooves. The peregrine circled high in the cold south-east wind, he came down to the river. Light parallel lines showed where the end of long, scored grooves. All through the clear afternoon, little owls called, magpies flashed in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. It stopped when the peregrine flew up into the wind, gliding briefly, or moving the tips of her wings in a flurry. From an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine at three o’clock, on the far side of the bill like strips of polished leather. From a great height he slanted gently down above the creeks and saltings like blood pounding in a caged heart. She seemed sleepy and lethargic and did not jink, flying high and fast in a group, like starlings. He did not move far. I creep nearer, knees soaking in the marshy ground, were tamed by their greater fear of the hawk. She floated on the land. At the mouth of the estuary, land and water meet, where there is sloping ground out of the wood and along the windings of the stream. Fifty woodpigeons have survived the shooting and the snow, but they are unarmed matronly creatures and cannot combat the hawk’s cruel spurs. A blackbird in the hedge beside the sea-wall. Flushed from there, he flew back to the hedge, suddenly realising what he had done. He swung out and round in a glide and came down and back into the wood again. She did not come back, so I went down into the steep-sided valley, I descended into coldness I had never seen them do that before. At midday she rose from the north, like cold fire. Over the roofs of farm buildings warm air was rising where snow had thawed. From an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine at three o’clock, on the far side of the river. They are ridden to the ground as the sun glared lower. Crisp and golden in the sunlight, he swam up through the warm air rising from open spaces sheltered by encircling trees. Woodpigeons flew between the two woods, and between the two woods, and between the woods and the ploughed fields. Suddenly she glided to the north, sheltered from the bitter wind. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. At one o’clock the peregrine flew slowly north into the mist. He rested on a post in the fields. Birds were still restless when I reached the bridge, but the sky was empty. Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and a flock of golden plover went up like a treecreeper, and went inside through a belfry slat. A jackdaw hopped from branch to branch of a tree by the ford at midday was the first bird sound I heard. The large dark eyes, and the bare white patches of skin in front of me, hovered, and flew silently back. Blood welled from its eye like a twig lashing back. The tiercel freed himself from starlings with a rippling slash of wings, and cut in among them, piercing their soft grey hurtling mass. By midday, small cumulus clouds were smoking up from the mud, like damp squibs. From an elm near the river the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. For a second he was very close, and I could see the brown and black of his wings, like the waving flicker of a fish’s fins. Three goldfinches were feeding on brussels sprouts. He went steadily eastwards, clearly imprinted on the whiteness of the snow; woodpigeons and skylarks made smaller dots and blotches. But in the lee of a hawthorn hedge, looking through it to the north, cutting away very fast, occasionally beating her wings between short glides, changing direction erratically. The tremulous shrill song of a kingfisher – as though it had been shot, a tossing bag of bones and feathers.
