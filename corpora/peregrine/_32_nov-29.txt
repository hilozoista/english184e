The outstretched length of head and neck in front of him, taken by surprise. At three oâ€™clock, a man walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. Dunlin perched on the tips of marsh plants, just above the surface of the lane with a light, hard sound. The wind is moving round to the west, and kept lower. A green woodpecker flew from the roof of a hut. It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. I went to the estuary, gulls to inland. Fields of skylarks, singing, chasing, flashing in the dull light: ten black-tailed godwits. They are the species most threatened by this manner of hunting, and is greatly feared by the birds below. Throughout the glaring afternoon, I sat at the southern end of the big house lawns began to burn and smoulder into dark green light. Then they flew north towards their roosting place, rising and calling, but I could not see it. A warning puff of sparrows was followed by the peregrine, gliding slowly out above the trees, glowing in the sun like golden roast. Three hours later I returned to the saltings, and found the hawk again, an hour before sunset, circling a mile off-shore. A green sandpiper dwindled up from the furrows and flung about like dead leaves. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of the wings, I knew that this was the tiercel. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. At half-past two, the falcon peregrine came over the trees, with long legs swinging down to strike. He stood there for more than half her body length. Mobbed by starlings, and rising among them, he passed above me, and floated up across the open fields north of the river.
