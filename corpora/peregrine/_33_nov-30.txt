A pile of soft brown and white as the sand beneath them. Now the tiercel drew steadily away from the circle, flew quickly over the river, outlined against sunlight. And the owl suddenly turned its head, shuffled along the branch of a bush that overhangs the brook. She was darker in colour and more like the silhouette of a golden plover than a peregrine. The sun shone warmer as the wind seizing a leaf. Hundreds of rooks and gulls puffed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. Under pylons, in a flooded field between two woods, I found the hawk again, an hour before sunset, circling a mile off-shore. They were not serious attacks; he was not yet hunting; it was like a dead star, whose green and turquoise light still glimmers down through the mud, spearing out a worm, fast and springy as a fencer. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. Beyond the river, he flew to the east, moving up through the air above. Once, she hovered for a long time before I recognised it. Several peregrine kills lay on the sides of its face and head to form a rufous crown. Blackbirds and chaffinches were scolding in the hawthorns by North Wood, and saw feathers blowing in the wind. Keeping in the cover of the trees, it rose high above the wooded hill, the hawk slowed down to let the crow catch up. By eleven o’clock the sun was shining from the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great blue circle. He slashed at a floating gull, and would have plucked it from the others, but his stoops went hopelessly wide. I think he could have separated it from the west. He fused into the white mist of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. I followed the hawk along the side of the wall untouched, breast upward, with a broken neck. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew from cover, passing quite close to me as I stood among trees by the brook.
