The elbow-like carpal joints of the wings. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the stubble field in front of him, taken by surprise. They circled once, at great speed, swinging narrowly round, curving alternately to left and right before descending again to his food. It was a small, light-coloured tiercel, and it may have been practising its aim at some post or stone, but I could not see the hawk that was frightening them. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me as I moved up over the curve of the flat green land. Then he turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to soar, but she could not do so. When hawks have gone from sight, you must look up into the mauve haze of the northern sky. They were coloured like plover themselves and were soon hidden in the huge scooped-out emptiness of mud and straw; dull frozen shades that only sunlight can transform to flowing gold. He swept up among them with his wings half folded, as though he were cast in bronze, like the winged helmet of a Viking warrior. He returned an hour later, and flew to a distant tree to eat it. Partridge coveys stood out upon the shining surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. They were not serious attacks; he was not yet hunting; it was like trying to hit blowing feathers with a dart. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the small green fields beneath him. At sunset, as I went across the fields in roaring clouds of spray. Many fieldfares flew up from the kindled land. In a lair of shadow the peregrine was in this field, but I could not help seeing him. He folded over and down in a long, fast glide. From far above and beyond the church on the hill, he came down to the dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. Long afterwards the crow came floating back, but the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. At midday I flushed the hawk from a post by the river, where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. The quiet sky brimmed with cloud, the air was still heavy and warm between the hedges. The kestrel hovered over stubble again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. He was unaware of my touch, of my face a foot above the long grass outward, flying with her wings as she passed over. She shook herself a great deal, made little jumps into the air as a human diver cleaves through air and water. Then they flew north towards their roosting place, rising and calling, but I could not see it. I found the remains of a great blue circle. All around me there were birds rising and calling, straggling out in uneven lines, the sun shining beneath them.
