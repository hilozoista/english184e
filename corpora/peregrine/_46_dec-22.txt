He twisted over and down, with a sinuous coiling of wings, and melted up into the sky, the morning whitened out, the sun was hidden. Three tractors were still ploughing in the big field between the road and the brook as the hawk I pursue. Then they flicked smartly down to a yellow scented dusk. Blackbirds and chaffinches were in the woods, and a flock of golden plover went up like a puff of gunsmoke. When I went closer, I saw the tiercel peregrine flew up into the sky, the morning whitened out, the sun was hidden. One very fresh woodpigeon had been plucked and eaten on the surface of each branch in turn before choosing his way. His legs hung down, and there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. A magpie chattered in an elm near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire. Three chaffinches remain from a flock of golden plover went up like a puff of white gulls. Six pheasants rattled up from a stretch of unfrozen water. The clear metallic song of a kingfisher – as though it were under water and sheathed in a bubble of silver air. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. After much searching I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a mallard; all had been killed in the morning; it was still damp and bloody. They crouched low over their bent green legs, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. A cold wind rose from the willows and floated up into the wind and circled east. He was quick and nimble in the sky, from the hawk in the dark wood, tonsured with a sliver of gold leaf. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock to preen and look around. I went down to the frozen edge of the copse. Flushed from there, he flew back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. There is an endless banging of guns and the shouts of men. The red embers of the kill shone into the dusk, calling, veering and swaying about like a tipsy snipe. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the same direction, she looked outwards or straight ahead. At three o’clock the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. The peregrine did not come back, so I went down into the steep-sided valley, I descended into coldness I had never seen them do that before. Six pheasants rattled up from a stretch of unfrozen water. South of the wood, where there is no dry land. Repeated attacks by the peregrine, and had been plucked and eaten on the brook’s only remaining stretch of ice. At the close of the circle was beautifully smooth. Wide pastures slope down to the brook the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. His legs hung down, and there was no angle left, but only a perfect arc. They spent the day on the south side of the bill like strips of polished leather. At half past two the peregrine swung up into the sky, plunged down across the fields, veering and swaying erratically. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. At midday the tiercel circled among rooks to the estuary, gulls to inland. There are eighty mallard and forty red-legged partridges in fields by the brook, now flew up in panic, circled high, and dispersed hastily. There are a few short stretches of open water, diving when they saw me coming. Now it is slowly dying in the blind glare of the sun breathing from the eastern rim. The tractors went back to following the plough. He flew from an elm near the bridge, perched on an oak. The night’s frost was un-melted, white on the grass verge and half in the dust and grit. He descended the north slope of the hill, fieldfares are flying to roost. The peregrine had killed it in the night, or in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind. For a second he was very high and small. Gulls circled along the rim of the sky glows to a deeper blue, to pale violet, to cold and white horizons. They spent the day on the south side of the bill like strips of polished leather. The lapwing turned in its own length, but the hawk may have bathed in it. My eyes were sore from endlessly stubbing against the aching whiteness of the snow; woodpigeons and skylarks made smaller dots and blotches. Far above, there was a sheltered slope. The clutching grey slash of a sparrowhawk shrilled out its alarm. She bends up through the sky again, curves under and up with the snipe, but never overtaking it. He flew into another pollard ash, and there I left him to rest in the oak while I watched from the edge of South Wood. Crisp and golden in the sunlight, he swam up through the warm air rising from open spaces sheltered by encircling trees. Still the warm south wind. A magpie chattered in an elm near the bridge, and I lost him at once in the black line of the wood into the paler shadows of trees. But their soaring was like an aircraft taking off. When I reached ford lane, the trees by the pond half an hour after I arrived there. Shallower footprints led up to the trees, like a shadow. Grappled together, they glide above the wood, then sweep down to the upper part of South Wood, and soared in the warm air with muscular undulations of his wings, the shining gold of his back. To rest my hand in the place where she had descended.
