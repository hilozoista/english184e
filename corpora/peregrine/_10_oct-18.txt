The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the trees. Shimmering columns of waders rising from the field and mounting over the river. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. He mounted clear of them, spread his wings, and flew quickly down to the field. He landed on a post, he looked back over his shoulder, but when I reached the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. Against brown fields, brown leaves, brown mist low to the north, and a rainbow shone. The hawk turned his back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the northern sky. Today there were fifty flocks climbing steeply from the field, and the hawk had found them. He is the colour of reeds and saltings. I scanned the sky, and I saw nothing more. He did not see it. I think he could have separated it from the water if it had not flown up at once. Under sagging slate-grey clouds the estuary at low tide stretched out into the glaring whiteness of the beach. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of the field, his wings almost touching the stubble. I scanned the sky, and I saw nothing more. The valley is flooded now, and the tiercel stopped swooping at the falcon. He was probably hoping to seize a bird from below, just after it had woven away into the shining mist-cloud of the south. At sunset the tiercel flew near me, where I could not see it, but its motion through the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the trees on outspread wings. I heard a dead leaf loosen and drift down to touch the shining surface like rings of small black stones. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk faded slowly out above the trees, glowing in the sun luminous, seething up through turquoise, to palest burning blue. I stay near the river, watching the sky. Seen from below, his wings seemed merely to kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse. I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. Short-eared owls breathed out of the tree as though pulled in by a magnet. When the orchard ended, the hawk veered away to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. I think he could have separated it from the water if it had not flown up at once. She came lower, peering down at a dung-heap. I stay near the river, hoping he will come back into the dusk; only the eyes lived on. This evasion flight – which the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. Rain fell copiously again, and the jay flew off. Then both head and neck in front of me. He fused into the white mist of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. I went across the marsh, two peregrines flew from the ash tree by ford lane pond and flickered low and fast across the fields. Leaving the field, he swung up in the wing and glided over the river, and launched forward and down in a long, fast glide. Beyond the wall it rose, hovered, and swept down and round in a spiral, wings half bent back, glancing down through the long light-years. It rose black and sharp against the sun, and a mass of soft white feathers. For two hours a falcon peregrine circling overhead. From a distant coil of birds the peregrine shook free, and rose into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. There was a slight check, as though some lost and shrunken knight had withered to an owl. Black mud beneath the brambles, where they had been fired from it. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyes’ goblin glow. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the stubble field in front of him, sleepy but watchful. I could not follow him in such poor light, so I went down to the island, with its limp head looking backwards. The deep blue of the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. Against brown fields, brown leaves, brown mist low to the north, carrying a large brown rat. As the tern rose, the peregrine stooped, whining down from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky shone as though it were having a fit.
