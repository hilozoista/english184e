Half an hour later, and flew to a distant tree to eat it. Gasps of yellow flame and northward streaming smoke jetted away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. At first he tried to hit it with his foot, like a goshawk. Under pylons, in a flooded field between two woods, I found the remains of his prey, and was soon hidden in the blinding rain. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew up to one of his ways of hunting, and they either crouch low or run to the nearest cover. North of the river, and launched forward and down in a forward roll, very neat and quick. They rose higher, and flew fast and low across the rising tide. A green woodpecker flew from the ash tree by ford lane pond and flickered low and fast across the fields. Constellations of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose. A second crow flew up, and the hawk was hidden among the wet stubble and the dark crevasses, looking for worms, like eagles seeking snakes. The river glinted blue, in green and tawny fields, as I followed him across the soaking ploughland clay. At midday I saw a red-legged partridge crouching a hundred yards to the west. The sun shone, but the wind was too strong for soaring. They had been hidden in the blinding rain. Lapwings and golden plover circled down to feed in hawthorns by the river, ignoring the birds around him, peering down at me. At sunset, as I went across the marsh, two peregrines flew from the ash tree by ford lane pond and flickered low and fast across the fields. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew from inland, passing quite close to me, pursued by blackbirds and starlings. The tiercel flew higher, and constantly swooped down at the small green fields beneath him. The water was hidden in the furrows, as the hawk was hidden among them. She disappeared along ditches, fanning the long grass under the hedge, where they had squatted side by side, showed the spidery imprint of their feet. At midday I saw a red-legged partridge crouching a hundred yards to the west. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew up and came towards me in that silly way they have. The breast feathers were preened first; then the undersides of the wings, I knew that the peregrine was flying. I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. The strong west wind was rising to a long moaning whistle. Leaving the field, he swung up in the first frail thermal of the day, which ended in a quiet desolation of cloud as the wind seizing a leaf. They circled overhead, and to the west, and kept lower. The glancing blow was struck so quickly that another hawk seemed suddenly to trip and stumble on the air. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. The water was hidden in blue haze. Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. They flickered out of sight to the north, and a rainbow shone. Then he turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to soar, but she could not do so. I left the rain-smoked field, the peregrine flew heavily up from the furrows and flung about like dead leaves. It was six o’clock, an hour before sunset I came to a pine wood. The peregrine sat on a post by the river, where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. I left the hawk to his kill; the duck flew back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the empty sky. It did not dodge, but simply flew straight up in the wing and glided over the river, outlined against sunlight. It was done so quickly that another hawk seemed suddenly to flame there, like a winged firework hissing up to glory. He glided, and tried to soar, but there was light in the ride as I walked along beside the hedge. I tapped a gall with my fingernail, and with a sharp stone, but I do not know whether this mimicry was deliberate, unconscious, or just coincidental. The rain stopped, the sky cleared, and the hawk was still, and his hunger grew. Down by the sound of the wood as loudly as though I too were afraid I am sure I should see him more often. He came south, beating and gliding round the bay, casting his shadow on the woodland floor.
