Roads were furled and arched, smoothed and decked with trees. The white cross hair of alder twigs, the thick burgundy rings of chestnuts, narrowed and gleamed in sunlight. A sparrowhawk flew gently overhead, beating its wings in the snow, flicking the eye out with its bill.
I walked along the sea-wall towards the estuary, and was surprised to find a peregrine flying. I looked all around, but could not find it. I went closer, but the hawk was still far away. Suddenly I realised that I was flying over the all-night killing fields of kestrels, and that the hawk was not there. I went back to the car park.
At three o’clock the sky above the estuary was filled with forty-five mallard. The peregrine circled high above the orchard, glowing in the sun like a headless chicken. I looked all around, but could not find him. I went back to the car park.
Five minutes later I saw him over the wall. He was small and pale, with a tight clenched-on ball of feathers. He faced the wind, looked grimy and stalwart out on the stony heights of the hill. I could not force my eyes away from the white surface of their sockets, which churned up and distended with vision like black obsidian in the eye. They moved in slow relief, like the teeth of a harpoon. The peregrine turned and left to the north, and the mallard turned and descended into the orchard. Under a black Thylacoleo thistle I could see the peregrine breathing heavily, as I expected, since he had come so soon. He looked around, took several steps forward, then stopped. He was breathing heavily again. He looked very healthy and relaxed, even though the day was ending.

There are a few short stretches of open water left, but they too will soon be frozen. Last summer, kingfishers nested in the bank of the stream that flows down to the brook through South Wood. The marshy ground below the tall thin trees shone with kingcups. Bluebells on the higher slopes were a blue mist above the yellow. Suddenly the kingfisher appeared in front of me, hovered, and flew silently back. In the green sunlight dappled on the water it gleamed like a luminous-sharded rain beetle. It had a glow-worm radiance, as though it were under water and sheathed in a bubble of silver air. It clouded the sun’s reflection with a streaming haze of emerald blue. Now it is slowly dying in the blind glare of the snow. Soon it will be sepulchred in the ice it cannot pierce, crushed into frozen light below the dark cave where it was born.
A fungus of whiteness appears on the cloudy sky to the west as the sun rises over the white fields of ploughland. The earth clears, the sun shines, the wind falls. A nightjar looks out from the soil, like a bright eye looking in a dark cup. I remember that sepulchral brightness so well from so long a time ago. That cold and stony gloom of death suddenly flares up and shines out against the infinite sky. That is what it is like to be a kingfisher – locked in a ghostly battle with the earth and the night.
