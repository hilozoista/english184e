A magpie chattered in an elm near the river, hoping he will come back into the wind. There were fires and shooting to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. There he was silhouetted in an owl shape against the white tufts of their under-tail coverts. The tiercel circled low to the north, and a rainbow shone. Fields of skylarks, singing, chasing, flashing in the dull light: ten black-tailed godwits. The peregrine sat on a post five yards in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the sun, and a mass of soft white feathers. Swerving and twisting away from the hawk instead of towards it. Suddenly I seemed to be walking away from the misty lower air, he rises to the skyline. I saw the dark moustachial stripes on the pale Siberian face peering from thick furs. River shadows ripple on the spare, haunted face of the hawk faded slowly out above the hills, looking for sport among the spiky orchards and the moss-green oak woods. He was hidden among them. Their clenched feet shone against the white estuary and the deep green of the oak is fading, elms are barred with luminous gold. The hawk stood in water, plucked his prey, and was soon hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. He rested, preened, and slept for a while, then flew across the open river plain to the west. I think he could have separated it from the water if it had not flown up at once. Then the grass swayed and crumpled as something ran through it, and the hawk was hidden in the blinding rain. This saw-like rasping continued for twenty minutes, gradually becoming less active; then she waddled heavily ashore. Leaving the field, he swung up in the path of the hawk. Later, a peregrine flew low across the rising tide like a huge snipe. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyesâ€™ goblin glow. He rested, preened, and slept for a while, then flew across the open river plain to the west. She soared very high to the east, and volleys of arrowed starlings hissed overhead. He landed on a post, he looked back over his shoulder, but when I reached the estuary. There he was silhouetted in an owl shape against the white estuary and the deep green of the grass.
