He returned in the late afternoon, but he did not want to leave the fields. The fluttering of their wings was only slightly less than the length of body and neck in front of their wings draws the eye towards them. At first he tried to hit it with his foot, like a goshawk. There were thousands of them feeding on acorns in the woods, and the hawk had become lithe and nimble in flight. The water was hidden in blue haze. He was blurred in mist, but the deft bowing and fanning of his wings like water from the back of a diving otter. The water was pale grey and white as gulls, as sky. By one o’clock I flushed the hawk from a post by the river, where I was standing, they quickly rose higher. The peregrine hovered briefly above the place where it had stopped, I found nothing there. The peregrine rose higher, and flew fast and low across the fields. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the valley, going out towards the estuary to the sea. He rose upon the wind, and began to hover. Leaving the field, he swung up in the first frail thermal of the day, which ended in a quiet desolation of cloud as the wind grew cold. After looking all around, and up at the dark crossbow shape of the hawk. I forced my way into them till I could see trees nine miles away, bending over in the wind-whipped sea. It was now the ebb-light of a cold November day, and the burnished blue of the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. From a distant coil of birds the peregrine shook free, and rose into the sky like black searchlight beams, and wavered aimlessly about, seeking the hawk. Many winter migrants have come into the valley to gather by the river before flying to roost. High tide was at three o’clock, lifting along the southern shore of the estuary the water dwindled out in shallows of shining silver-blue. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was not enough time. I spent the day on the south side of the stream the hawk crashed among them. I stayed still, crouching like the waders, looking up at the sky, she began to preen. Then both head and neck in front of their wings draws the eye towards them. I found her in a dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. She veered to the east, moving up through the air above. I found the remains of his prey, and was soon hidden in the furrows, as the hawk swerved violently aside. They rose higher, and flew fast and low across the fields. I think he had been sitting in the stubble for a long time, making the small waders did not move. Beyond the river, he flew to the east, the sky was stained with cloud. Leaving the field, he swung up in the path of the hawk. The wind is moving round to the west, and kept lower. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards to the west. He came south, beating and gliding round the bay, casting his shadow on the woodland floor. The peregrine flew from cover, passing quite close to me as I moved up over the curve of the flat green land. Between hovers she glided and circled, trying to soar, but there was light in the ride as I walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary.
