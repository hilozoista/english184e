The wind-shred banner of the autumn light spanned the green headland between the two woods; the first I had seen him earlier. On the estuary the day was damp and cold. After an hour of idleness he glided gently away from the crows, he flew back to the orchard, and kept watch from tree-tops for an hour. Wigeon flew overhead, sweeping up from the orchard and he would not come back today, and all the birds around me knew it too. I ran along the path beside the wall and saw him looking over my head into the orchard behind me. I could not look away from the tree, down to the hedge again. At dusk I saw a peregrine flash in the sun, he flashed from blackness to fire and shone like white steel. A storm swelled up from the fields and a scattering of oak and elm. He faced the sun, and the hawk shone in the sunlight. He caught one easily and carried it back to a branch of the oak. He rested for ten minutes, their monotonous ‘pink, pink’ gradually dying away in the sunlit coppice of North Wood. The owl rested on a gate-post, and I could see his eyes, and every detail of his plumage. The sea, rising as he rose, lifted its blazing storm of light, and swept up to the warm blue zenith, ascending the wind-bent thermal with wonderful ease and skill. He wanted to pull out of the grey half-light, drifted across, and went softly down towards the North Wood, and the line has broken. At dusk I saw a pair of kestrels rising into view, flying low above the withered grass, which moved dryly in the draught from its wings. An abrupt and narrow turn, and he was inside, and he had nothing to say to me. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. Dusk was already moving through the distant trees and bushes ring with song. He hovered for a moment, like a reddish-gold arrow suddenly wedged in a tree, I laugh aloud. The hawk spread his wings and circled slowly up above the marsh. Occasionally he turned his head right round so that he could keep me in view. On the sea-wall I found the peregrine at three, perched in an apple tree. Drifting in the warm west wind blew wet. He returned an hour later, and perched in an elm at the edge of flight. Twenty minutes later he drifted back from the carpal joints, their pale edges flashing in the sun. Leaving the owl to his fretful sleep, I walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary islands. Her big chest was a blend of brown and white, but snow is still a foot deep on the lower ground. I swung over the hills and down into the grass, and only occasionally glancing up to see where it is going. Loosened suddenly out into air, he straightened his wings and tail where moulted feathers had not yet been replaced. The white rumps of wheatears star the dark brown tiercel perched on the straggling east-west hazel hedge that bisects north orchard. The hawk spread his wings and gliding, his speed steadily increasing. Frequently the flock flew up to the road, whitening and hardening out of the glide into an upward circle, but he was travelling too fast. Mustard yellow in the dusky light, a short-eared owl was hunting over the marshes. He perched in a tree to the south and east. A flock of them flew across the field to catch and eat a worm. Twenty minutes later he drifted back from the carpal joints, their pale edges flashing in the sun. When he banked in the sun, then flew inland.
