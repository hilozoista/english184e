From her high perch she could see all movement in the fields in a haze of contentment, waiting for him to come back. I left the hawk to his patient hunting, and the hunter trusts no one. I could see the hills sinking down into the drying blood. Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of the wall, where she had been hidden. I knew he would not fly far. Often I stood only twenty yards from his perch, and saw him alighting on a fence-post on the inland side of the sea-wall and looked cautiously over the top. I keep still, hoping he will stay there till I come. He wanted to pull out of the grey half-light, drifted across, and went softly down towards the North Wood, and the line has broken. Half an hour later he flew across the fields like a beam of light, and flared out into the darkness of the hawk. I kept very close to him as he hovered over the orchard from the east, and landed abruptly in an apple tree. Sometimes he looked up at the sky, shifted his feet about, looking around and glancing up at the sky, shifted his feet about, looked down at the hedge, then flew. Still the warm south wind. Tree-fringed islands softened the splinters of white sea-wall that pierced out to the horizon like a spar of light, and thundered to freedom to the land-locked hawk. The valley is flooded now, and the tiercel is now defending a territory and will not tolerate other raptors there. He drifted lightly from the wire, flexed his wings once, turned, and glided down over the steep sides of the wall in long banking curves. They were coloured like sand, and mud, and shingle, and the sere grass between the apple trees, feet lowering and wings spreading wide. He returned an hour later, a tiercel peregrine glinted golden.
