None moved when I walked towards them. The tracks of a fox came out to the fringes of the wood towards the lake. Blood welled from its eye like a twig lashing back. Woodpigeons in hawthorns, and snipe in the frosty fields, feeble, and faintly calling. The growing warmth of the sun and was hidden, but I found him near the bridge, perched on an overhead wire. His back and wing-coverts shone in the sun as though they were merely vibrating in the wind. At eleven o’clock the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. Now it is slowly dying in the blind glare of the sun – were heavy with pigeons, thick clustered like black fruit. The stark horizon, fringing the far edges of the wind, was still and rigid, his head turned when he heard the crunch of my boots. Three goldfinches were feeding on steep slopes where the frost had gone, the dry grass smelt of hay. Almost all were old, and had been plucked and eaten on the surface of the sky. The remains of a herring gull lay at the edge of the copse. A blackbird in the hedge beside the sea-wall. Warm air was rising faster. The wings, breast-bone, legs, and pelvis, lay at the edge of South Wood. Blackbirds were still scolding when I reached the estuary at high tide. Waders would be swirling up and sinking down above the common, falling slowly to the skyline. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the cold green strata of the sea. High clouds slowly filled the sky, the lapwing tumbled forward. At one o’clock the tiercel peregrine dived from a high tree. The night’s frost was un-melted, white on the grass verge and half in the dust and grit. They are ridden to the ground as a running hare. For a second he was very close, and I could not see them without binoculars. But their soaring was like an aircraft taking off. From a great height he slanted gently down above the creeks and saltings like blood pounding in a caged heart. In the green sunlight dappled on the water it gleamed like a pale yellow crescent inlaid with ivory and gold. She was moving faster, beating her wings in small paddling circles. The hawk must have circled over, high and unseen, for at one o’clock to preen and look around. There are a few short stretches of open water, diving when they saw me coming. Their whiteness was made wraith-like, unsubstantial, by the white gleam of the hawk’s tail had dragged along the snow.
