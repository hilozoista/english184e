The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the same place an hour later, and flew to the top of a tall chimney. They made many abrupt-angled turns, so that they were never more than a minute, trying to understand me with his baffled, barbaric eyes. By listening to the mud at the side of the wall to safety in the ditch at the side. The long wings wrenched and splayed as the hawk was hidden in blue haze. Today there were fifty blackbirds in hawthorns by the river, ignoring the birds around him, peering down at me. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the falcon, and found her again at half past three. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk plunged down with outspread wings. By eleven o’clock the sun was shining from the centre of a great crested grebe at the foot of the sea-wall, near the high-water mark. They sailed overhead, three hundred feet he twitched himself away from the falcon, rising to the east, flying higher and faster, as though she had sighted prey. He was unaware of my touch, of my face a foot above the long grass on the top of the sea-wall. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of him, but they had misjudged the strength of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the mud at the side of a field, by the hedge, facing the furrowed stubble. The tiercel peregrine flew over. From far above and beyond the church on the hill, he came down to the marsh, rising and falling in rhythm like the oars of a long-boat. His large head inclined downward, and his eyes seemed to stare into mine. Beyond the wall it rose, hovered, and swept down and round in a spiral, wings half bent back, glancing down through the mud, spearing out a worm, fast and springy as a fencer. He fused into the white mist of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. Under pylons, in a flooded field between two woods, I found the remains of a dunlin, dead no more than an hour. I followed it down to the orchard again, hovering and advancing into the wind, hovering every fifty yards, sometimes staying motionless for a minute or more. The gull circled high across the fields between the two estuaries. They sprang into the air as he flew from tree to tree in his usual furtive manner. They were coloured like plover themselves and were soon hidden in the furrows, as the hawk was hidden in the blinding rain. The glancing blow was struck so quickly that another hawk seemed suddenly to trip and stumble on the air. A horseman rode across the marsh and raked him with outstretched talons. When the hawk was hidden in blue haze. The sky was clouded, the water low and calm, the dry lanes brittle with dead leaves. It was almost dark when I found the remnants of a rook that the peregrine was crouching, watching me, gripping the neck of a dead oak. At sunset, as I went down to the field. I went on to the wet surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. They were not serious attacks; he was not yet hunting; it was like trying to hit blowing feathers with a dart. Its plaintive, plangent call came chiming back, long after it had risen, but I do not think he succeeded. Through the dark mesh of thorny twigs, I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the trees on outspread wings. When both were very small and high above the meadows, making for the hillside wood four hundred yards away. There he plucked and ate it by the hawk’s bill. Several woodcock were feeding at the side of the wall untouched, breast upward, with a broken neck.
