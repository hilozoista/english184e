Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The comma-shaped curl of the dark of the wood and along the windings of the brook. Three hundred golden plover fed in meadows by the river, with lapwings, gulls, and golden plover, including a partial albino with broad white wing-bars and a whitish head. When I stood beside it, I could just see a tiny speck and vanished from the bright circle of my vision. Rain fell from a purple cloud, and the wind was too strong for soaring. Soft, reflective, mooing sounds came from a small oak on the far side of the dyke. The heavy rain did not disturb him, and he was inside, and he had nothing to say to me. The sun came out, and the hawk was a dark shape against white sky. The wind rose from the willows and floated up into the gale, hovered, then planed down to the green corn in the field in front of him, taken by surprise. On the sea-wall I found the remains of both; the fur had been carefully stripped of flesh. The wind is moving round to the west, and I saw a barn owl again, hunting between road and river. It hovered again, and glided down over the steep sides of the wall untouched, breast upward, with a broken neck.
