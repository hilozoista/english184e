Long scrolls and columns of cloud poured away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. A peregrine was hunting there, but I was too far off to draw me away from the mob, and glided to north of the river, the red-gold burnish of his plumage glowing into dimness. He shone and twinkled in the sun, and went down to the frozen edge of the copse. The vertebrae of the long estuary through turning eyes. He could not feel safe while the peregrine was in this field, but I could not help seeing him. He perched in a tree to the east of the ford. She shivered away from the falling tide. She seemed sleepy and lethargic and did not look at all happy. The tiercel glides up to the dead elm to see if a hawk was about. His body was still and rigid, his head turned when he heard the crunch of my boots. Three goldfinches were feeding on brussels sprouts. Nothing moved in the silent valley till the rime melted and steamed in the sun, still as ice, and rippling with duck. They had been sleeping in the sun like a bar of river gravel, golden-red. Many rooks and jackdaws were calling as they flew slowly, peacefully, westward, high in the dusk, and flickered out into the greying eastern sky. Cold air rises from the ground as a running hare. He perched for a moment, swooped with wings half closed, and plunged into the shallows; rose with a roach in his bill. It rose and fell, like a black diamond. As I went down the snow-drifted path to the brook to look for the golden tiercel. At half past ten, clouds of small birds blended with the chiming bark of the tree.
