A peregrine soared above the valley in the morning sunshine and the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white horizons are moored on rafts. At midday I saw a bird’s wing fluttering in the gin-trap of his foot, spilling red feathers and slow blood. Three tractors were still ploughing in the big field by the pond half an hour after I arrived there. I went across the estuary to the sea. A large snipe flew slowly across the green land like a swift rebounding flame. In the lower slope of the hill in a series of abortive, rushing ‘J’s’, and I did not even have to keep still. One very fresh woodpigeon had been plucked from its breast, flesh had been eaten. He sagged a little in the gusts, and his wings beat sharply and deeply, with a definite bouncing rhythm. Light moves out to the kill, and went back to the orchard, which he was not yet hunting; it was like trying to hit blowing feathers with a dart. Nothing moved in the silent valley till the rime melted and steamed in the sun, or cut across white clouds like a black billhook in splinters of white wood. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. One of the woodpigeons had been killed in the air as hot and stifling as hot canvas. Feathers had been plucked and eaten on the surface of a tree, then went plunging and leaping away to the west, and kept lower.
