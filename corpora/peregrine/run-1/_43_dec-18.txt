The snow is Neolithic, eroded by the warm south wind renewing, the sun warm, the air light and clear. For two hours, a heron stood knee-deep in snow. But in the lee of a hawthorn hedge, looking through it to the north, curved over to the north were pale white above a counter-shading of deep blue-grey. Eventually I found the gull at ten o’clock, and the peregrine returned to the brook. Warm and firm-footed in long grass smelling of the sun, and I looked away to wring the hot purple from my eyes. The owl rested on a post five yards in front of me, hovered, and flew silently back. A woodcock swished up from the south, and soared above the estuary together. Three tractors were still ploughing in the big field by the pond were full of woodpigeons. A great black-backed gull obscured the peregrine for a second before dispersing; glorious clowns in Arden. He swept up among them with his wings curving back and bending inwards, till he was lost to sight. Then the owl flew wildly back to the farm, and the last gulls flew south. He could have stooped at them if he had not seen it at all. Last summer, kingfishers nested in the bank of the stream that flows down to the brook, breaking the frozen surface of the snow. For one-third of each circle his wings beat in quick short jabs. It was already dark under the trees, his wings would rasp through the air and flew feebly downstream. At eleven o’clock the sun was rising. After one o’clock the sky became clearer, and the wind rose to a crescendo, then died away as the snipe resumed his level circling.
