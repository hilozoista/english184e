The morning sun was low and dazzling, and the wind cold, as I walked along the sea-wall by the north shore of the estuary. A falcon peregrine startled me by her sudden upward leap from the lee of the wall, where she had been hidden. I was directly above her, looking down at the long tapering span of her wings and the humped width of her back. She rose quite silently, like a short-eared owl, and flitted away across the marsh, rocking violently from side to side, tilting between two vertical planes, standing in air on the tip of each wing in turn. When a long way off, she glided slowly down into the grass. I could not find her again. She had been sleeping in the sun – perhaps after bathing – and had not heard me coming.
Heavy rain fell in the afternoon. The falcon flew up to a dead oak, near the sea-wall, and watched the waders gathering on the saltings at high tide. She was still there when I left, huddled and sombre in the pouring rain, as whistling wigeon drifted in with the tide and the babble of waders grew louder.
