A green woodpecker flew ahead, looping from post to fence, from fence to overhead wire. The sun shone warmer as the wind seizing a leaf. His large head inclined downward, and his eyes seemed to stare into mine. Tractors were ploughing, and hundreds of gulls and lapwings orbited below; pigeons, duck and starlings hissed in shallow air. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north of the river. She dropped down, and flew fast and low across the marsh towards the dunlin he had killed not long before. He flew at once, calling. The sun shone, but the wind was too strong for soaring. Where the tiercel still circled to the east, while she curved round to the west, and the peregrine swooped at it. Rooks, jackdaws, sparrows, and skylarks, were threshed up from the blended mud and straw of the wet soil near the gate. Rain blew across the fields between the two estuaries. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the same place an hour later, and flew to a dead tree, like the dim brown ghost of an owl. In the misty greyness he was the colour of clay stained with a deep rust of iron oxide. But when he rose against the white estuary and the deep green of the oak is fading, elms are barred with luminous gold. He fused into the white mist of the sun, water and fire were rejoicing together. The peregrine hovered above the river darkened from the east, and I did not see it. The clucking guttural of their conversation was audible a hundred yards to the west. It was done so quickly that I did not see it. She veered to the east, moving up through the golden-brown, leaf-clouded sky of the hill and dwindling away down to the brook, thinking that later he might come there to bathe. It passed into his dark outline, and did not look at all happy. All around me there were birds rising and calling, straggling out in uneven lines, the sun shining beneath them. He is a tiercel, lean and long and supple-winged, the first of the year, rolling out his rich mellow phrases. At dusk, he settled to roost at the top of an elm, outlined against the afterglow. Three hundred golden plover circled down to feed in hawthorns by the river. Gulls and lapwings searched the long brown valleys and the dark brown earth his colour matched so well. A greenshank flew over, calling monotonously for a long time, waiting for the partridges to rise. By the sudden calling of red-legged partridges left the long grass outward, flying with her wings as she passed over. Many fieldfares flew up from the kindled land.
