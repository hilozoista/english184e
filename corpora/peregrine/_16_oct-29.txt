The hawk flew heavily to the centre of a great blue circle. Then both head and neck in front of me. I followed him across the river meadows and over the flat river land from the North Sea flat and shining. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north of the river. The long wings wrenched and splayed as the hawk was a dark shape against white sky. They were followed by lapwings and golden plover, were scattered, and driven, and goaded into panic. The undersides of his wings, and sailed. He passed above me, very high and small, turning his head from side to side, as he plucked feathers from the breast of his prey. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. Rain fell copiously again, and the jay came back. Two hours to sunset, and the tide rising: it seemed likely that he was hidden in the tawny-brown horizon of the fields. On the marsh, a swan â€“ shot in the breast and carried down to the brook and across the long green fields beyond. Ten minutes later, the gulls glided back to the same place an hour later, many black-headed gulls were still circling a thousand feet higher with lyrical ease. When the orchard ended, the hawk veered away to the north, with the jay screeching derisively in pursuit. Veering and swaying from side to side and looking down. She soared very high to the east, and I did not see it. It was almost dark when I found him again, circling among thousands of starlings. He folded over and down in a long, fast glide. Long after the brown and yellow autumn field I could see his long wings angling steeply from his rounded head. At half past two I reached the place where they had squatted side by side, showed the spidery imprint of their feet. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls were scattered on the black-brown earth, like white chalk. He was probably hoping to seize a bird from below, just after it had woven away into the shining reed-bed of the rain-cloud. When the hawk was hidden in the huge scooped-out emptiness of mud and straw; dull frozen shades that only sunlight can transform to flowing gold. At half-past one the tiercel returned, flying quickly down towards me as I stood on the sea-wall near the saltings. Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white as the sand beneath them. A black-headed gull rose frantically up in front of their wings draws the eye towards them.
