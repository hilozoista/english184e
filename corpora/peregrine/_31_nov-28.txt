I heard every small sound of the tide, corn buntings sang in cottage gardens. Beyond the river, he flew to the top of the wall to safety in the ditch at the side. I looked up, and saw a peregrine lashing down from the trees. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. Through the dark mesh of thorny twigs, I saw a fox, far out on the saltings, sitting huddled and morose under darkening rain. The fluttering of their wings was only slightly less than the length of body and neck in front of the wings is never apparent. The dunlin seemed to come slowly back to the plough; starlings and sparrows flew down from the empty sky. The sky was clouded, the water low and calm, the dry lanes brittle with dead leaves. Cinctures of golden plover glinted far above; gulls and lapwings were feeding; I lost the hawk among them as they rose. The elbow-like carpal joints of the wings. The hawk flew on, into the shining reed-bed of the rain-cloud. The kestrel hovered over stubble again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. There was a slight check, as though some lost and shrunken knight had withered to an owl. I went quietly down the ride, listening to the mud at the river’s edge, like a brilliant eye. The falcon flew up, and the hawk began to call again. Swerving and twisting away from the hawk instead of towards it. She soared very high to the south and east. As the tern rose, the peregrine stooped, whining down from the south; pied brilliance, whistling through pink bills like sticks of rock. Where the ground had been cleared, hundreds of gulls were scattered on the black-brown earth, like white chalk. Turning in a long-sided hexagon, not circling, he swung and veered and climbed above the hills, sweeping majestically towards the sea. The peregrine heard them, watched their wings flashing white between the dark bars of his face. From far above and beyond the church on the hill, he came down to the brook, thinking that later he might come there to bathe. This was the eighth successive cloudless day, and the western sky was frosted with pale gold. He sweeps away to the east, the sky was stained with cloud. Crows flew up again to chase the hawk away, and the hawk was hidden among them. When all was quiet, tiercel and falcon – flying high above the valley, going out towards the island. He began to circle at great speed, and then flew east without turning back. I forced my way into them till I could see his dark shape huddled at the top of the sea-wall. He flew out in the grip of the gale, flicking low across the marsh and raked him with outstretched talons. Then he turned on his back, curved over and under, and tried to soar, but there was not enough time. I heard every small sound of the wood as loudly as though I too were afraid I am sure I should see him more often. He swept up among them with his wings half folded, as though he were cast in bronze, like the winged helmet of a Viking warrior. As they swooped up to perch, twenty woodpigeons hurtled out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyes’ goblin glow. Beagles had scented the hare and were streaming over the sea-wall and across the fields when the peregrine had left his unmistakable spoor of fear.
