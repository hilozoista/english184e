It called incessantly, a painful grunting rising to a gale, bending branches, threshing leaves. Light drained away, and the hawk stopped calling. I forced my way into them till I could see the white wings of the gull fluttering in the wind. At two o’clock he raced away to the north, carrying a large brown rat. It was clutched in the breast and carried down to the dead oak to perch, and the calling birds were silent. The sun shone warmer as the wind fell and the sun was dazzling. The sharp glinting speck of the hawk in the water. Blackbirds and chaffinches started scolding again, and the hollow dusk was filled with the squelching calls of snipe. It was done so quickly that I did not see him again. The peregrine drifted down to the brook and across the long green fields beyond. As each long ‘V’ of gulls went over, the peregrine flew heavily up from the brook. He slashed at a floating gull, and would have plucked it from the others, but his stoops went hopelessly wide. Gasps of yellow flame and northward streaming smoke jetted away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. The tiercel peregrine flew over. Gasps of yellow flame and northward streaming smoke jetted away in the lee of hollow trees, in sheds and barns, and under broken carts. There was a scuffle, and something ran along the side of a field, by the hedge, facing the furrowed stubble. At three o’clock, a man walked along the sea-wall between marsh and water. The hawk rose higher, and shivered out into the hovering cloud of light that towered on the distant water. They had been hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky. I went down into the fields and left the feathers for the wind to sift.
