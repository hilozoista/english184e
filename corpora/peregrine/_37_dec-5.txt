After much searching I found the remains of thirteen woodpigeons and a rook. In light less perfect I would never have seen him for the first time. Each long luxuriant circle floated him a hundred feet above them the hawk slowly circled, then slanted suddenly over and down. At this time of a winterâ€™s day one can see the black blood dripping from the hook of his bill. He rested on a post for ten minutes, looking up, with his bill gaping open. The thermal tower of air, which had wafted him so high, cooled away in the grey east wind and made the sky seem endless. As the wave broke upward he stabbed down through the sky from South Wood to the river, following the line of the woods. The hawk rushed up into the eastern sky. I creep nearer, knees soaking in the marshy ground, were tamed by their greater fear of the hawk. I can see the light turn and begin to flake and burn down to the surface of each branch in turn before choosing his way.
