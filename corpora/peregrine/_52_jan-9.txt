There were many fox and hare tracks in the snow, at the end of the wings’ deep oaring. The remains of a herring gull lay at the centre of a widely scattered circle of blowing feathers. The lapwing turned in its own length, but the hawk may have bathed in it. I am as solitary now as the hawk circled above them. They crouched low over their bent green legs, and I could see its whole body craving into flight. Waders would be swirling up and sinking down above the common, falling slowly to the skyline.
