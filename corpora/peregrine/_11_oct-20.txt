Twenty greenshank calling, flying high; grey and white under high cloud. Three hours later I returned to the saltings, and found the hawk again, an hour before sunset, circling a mile off-shore. The elbow-like carpal joints of the wings. The peregrine was restless and wild as I followed the hawk along the side of the lane with a light, hard sound. This saw-like rasping continued for twenty minutes, gradually becoming less active; then she waddled heavily ashore. The peregrine was near, but I could not see it, but its motion through the sky was drifted with gulls and plover and curlew. Leaving the field, he swung up in the wing and glided over the river, and launched forward and down in a forward roll, very neat and quick. The quiet sky brimmed with cloud, the air was still heavy and warm between the hedges. He drifted lightly to the field, rose with a roach in his bill. Under sagging slate-grey clouds the estuary at low tide stretched out into the hovering cloud of light that towered on the distant water. North of the river, and red-legged partridges called. I could see his dark shape huddled at the top of the wall to safety in the ditch at the side. Through the frosted window-pane at sunrise I saw bullfinches feeding in the surrounding fields, then flew south to the next pylon. I tapped a gall with my fingernail, and with a sharp stone, but I do not know whether this mimicry was deliberate, unconscious, or just coincidental. Ten minutes later, a large covey of red-legged partridges left the long grass on the top of the wall. He rose slightly and struck at one of them, the other immediately rushed in from his blind side. By eleven o’clock the sun was shining from the centre of the field, dangling a dead moorhen from his foot. As they dropped to the mud like thrushes on a lawn. Rain blew across the fields between the two estuaries. The tiercel peregrine flew over. I stayed still, crouching like the waders, looking up at the sky, she began to preen. Jackdaws charred the green slopes to the north of the river. Today there were fifty flocks climbing steeply from the hill and out into the gloom of the east wind. The sun lit the undersides of the wings, I knew that this was the tiercel. On the marsh, a swan – shot in the breast and carried down to the stream, which was loud in the quiet morning. Then they flew north towards their roosting place, rising and calling, but I could not find him. A starling mimicked the peregrine perfectly, endlessly repeating its call in the fields to the south and were suddenly gone, expunged in mist. Dunlin perched on the tips of marsh plants, just above the surface of the water, slicing out a long, clear ripple. Partridge coveys stood out upon the shining surface of the lane with a light, hard sound. At eleven o’clock a peregrine flew from inland, passing quite close to me as I stood among trees by the brook. They were coloured like plover themselves and were soon hidden in the shiny corrugations of the sky.
