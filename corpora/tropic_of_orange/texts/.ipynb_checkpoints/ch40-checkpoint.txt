“I heard you need a special card. A social security card. How do I get this card? What is social security?”

“Do you want to work and pay taxes?”

“I can work.” Cuz looks serious.

“Don’t worry about it,” says Bobby.

“Is it true that people here all have guns, and they can shoot you if you make them mad?”

“Who told you that?”

“I heard it on the boat.”

“It’s an exaggeration.”

“Is it true there are medicines here you can take to make you crazy or make you float, and people here take them all the time?”

“More exaggerations. What else did you hear on the boat?”

“They said there is music. Rock ’n’ roll. Music with perverted words you can sing over and over to make you crazy. It’s right on the radio.”

“Here.” Bobby punches the radio on. “Listen for yourself.”

“I can’t understand it. Is it really perverted? Can they really sing anything they want? Do I have to understand it to go crazy?”

“Don’t worry. This is not what’s going to make you crazy.”

“Is this your car? How did you get such a car?” Little cuz looks out the windows. Everything along the I-5 swooshing by. She’s in a cherry-red Camaro, and everything’s swooshing by.

“That’s Camp Pendleton. That’s where I landed when I came here.” Bobby don’t tell her how many times he’s passed the place. Never been back. Camp’s quiet now. Used to be a busy place. Brother and he got bused up the coast. Probably to be sent to some home. They didn’t know. Got scared. Escaped from the bus. Scared they’d get somewhere and be found out. Found out they weren’t refugees. Found out and sent back. 50,000 refugees, all looking alike. Who was gonna notice two boys? They just ran away. Bobby says, “When I arrived, I was twelve, just like you.”

Cuz is hugging her Barbie Doll still in the box. Not gonna be the same troubles Bobby had. Not gonna let her cry like his brother.

“Take it out of the box,” Bobby says.

“No. I like it in the box.”

“Why did your brother jump ship?”

“He said if he didn’t, he’d be sent back. He could die in the ocean or die in prison. My brother was studying. He’s very smart. But my mother always said he talked too much. I don’t know, but I think he was talking too much.”

“Politics.”

“They say you can talk as much as you want here. This is good for my brother.”

“You talk a lot yourself.”

“Why did you come here? Do you know my village?” Cuz takes out a piece of paper folded in a square and folded again.

“What’s that?” Bobby suddenly swerves the Camaro. He’s thinking this twelve-year-old’s maybe a smuggler. Wah Ching got her smuggling. And he’s a dope.

“Dirt,” she says, opens it carefully, then folds it all back again. “It’s my village. The dirt from there.”

Bobby rolls his eyes and breathes again.

She just keeps on talking, “You speak a little strange. Why is that?”

“I don’t have to speak the language so much anymore. That’s the way it is. Do you always ask so many questions?”

“My brother says to ask questions. Then listen carefully and keep my eyes open. I promised to do this until I see him again.”

Bobby’s not saying nothing about the brother. If he’s lucky, he’s dead. Or maybe he’s hanging out at El Corralón in a fluorescent orange suit costing forty bucks a day. Waiting for immigration. Probably going for asylum. But probably gonna be busted. Nobody to say he’s got a big mouth. Nobody to say he’s dead meat back in the homeland.

Cuz is staring at her new Nikes. Made in China. Nikes get in. But not the bro.

Seems like the drive’s a cinch. Never got to L.A. so fast. But then inside, it’s a mess. Wall-to-wall all up and down the 5. Stopped up like a bad drain. Gotta get off the freeway. Take the side streets. Get by through the alleys. Takes hours. Streets stretched and shrunk this way and that. Someone put this city in the washer/dryer. Shrunk 50 percent in places. Then ironed it out 200 percent in others.

Bobby parks the Camaro. Locks in The Club. Automatic locks the doors. Introduces the cuz to her new home. Unlocks the security door. Unlocks the double bolts. House is stuffy. Locks the security door, but keeps the front door open. Opens some windows. Cuz looks out the bars at Koreatown.

Phone rings. It’s the Chicano reporter again. “I’ve been trying to reach you since yesterday,” he says.

Seems Bobby’s been trying to get home since yesterday.

“Yeah,” says the reporter. “Something’s gotta give. Like the pressure’s building.”

Bobby don’t know nothing about pressure, but he sure could use a smoke. “I called that number,” Bobby says. “Lady answered. Took a message. Said Rafaela and the boy weren’t there.”

“I don’t know how to tell you this. Rafaela’s hurt. She’s okay, but she got beat up. Some thug. No. She’s fine. She’s back at my place like I told you. She’s gonna be fine. I feel like it’s my fault. I mean it’s not my fault. I feel responsible. Listen. Will you listen? Sol got separated from her. Right. The boy’s disappeared. I don’t know. I have a flyer she gave me. It’s something called The Ultimate Wrestling Championship. Yeah. One of those Lucha Libre events. I know it sounds crazy. She insists the boy can be found at this fight. It’s all on the flyer. Look, I gotta catch my flight back. I’m leaving México City now. You got a a fax? Call me at my office. I’ll be back in L.A. in a couple of hours. I’ll check my messages.”

Don’t make no sense. What’s this flyer? Ultimate Wrestling. It’s a joke. Go ahead. Put it in the fax.

Bobby’s looking at the paper slipping out the machine. Mi casa es su casa! Bobby’s screaming. The bastard! Is this a joke? Where is that hijo de puta reporter? He calls him, but it’s the office phone. Reporter’s in the air over México. Damn. What’s this? A pinche poem? You sending me a poem? What the hell! He’s supposed to find Sol in a poem? It’s no use. He’s talking to a machine. He’s talking to Audex.

Little cuz looking at Bobby. Still hugging the Barbie in the box. Still asking the same questions. What’s social security? They said you had to have it. Bobby can’t think. He dials up a number and hands the cuz the phone. Keep the cuz busy.

“You have reached the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If you wish to hear this message in English, press one. If you wish to hear this message in Spanish, press two. If you wish to hear this message in Vietnamese, press three. If you wish to hear this message in Mandarin, press four. If you wish to hear this message . . .”

The cuz goes for the TV, fools with the remote. Remote turns on the VCR. Snaps on the tube. She don’t know. She’s just curious. It’s all new to her. America’s a surprise. Channels changing like crazy.

Bobby’s not paying no attention. He’s gotta find Sol. He’s staring at the tube trying to think. Tube’s got Korean channel speaking something. Maybe it’s Russian. Some’s Swahili. Spanish channel’s speaking English with an accent. Everybody in the Mexican soap’s speaking the Queen’s English. Other hand, network’s speaking fluent Castilian. Some’s even in Mandarin. He understands it. He’s thinking too it’s not a mistake; it all makes sense. But! Does Connie Chung even speak Mandarin? Does that Trek character Chekov speak Russian? Or George Takei, does he speak Japanese? Does Anthony Quinn speak Greek, Turkish, or Spanish? Does David Carradine speak anything but slow English? Who’s gonna understand all this all the time? This some joke?

Meantime cuz’s channel surfing just like she’s been doing it all her life. Youth catches on fast. Maybe it’s the surfing. Faster she checks out, faster the lenguas check in. TV’s gone crazy.

Suddenly he makes her stop. It’s in Spanish this time. Lucha Libre. Gonna be The Ultimate Wrestling Championship. Some dude named El Gran Mojado. Unbeatable. To the death. Hey. Pacific Rim Auditorium. Noon. Sunday. June 28th. Tomorrow! Call Ticketmaster. Or check out the closest Blockbuster, Robinson-May, Music Plus. But hurry, tickets going fast. Gonna be sold out. Who’s the sponsor? Drink called Passion. Drink Passion. That’s it.

Bobby sets the cuz up with some frozen microwave, Famous Amos, and a glass of milk. Tells the cuz to sit tight. He’s got some business to take care of. She’s got the Barbie doll, her village dirt, and the remote. By the time he gets back, she’s gonna be glued good. Now hit the road. Find the boy.

Pacific Rim Auditorium’s not far. Something tells him he better go on foot. And he better leave now to make it by tomorrow. Not gonna move no machine, no Camaro, through these streets. Used to go everywhere on foot. Knows the alleys and the little streets. Been a while since he maneuvered the barrio. Been a while since any vato called him the Chino Loco. True, some things’d changed big-time, but he knew that. And some things never gonna change. Órale, it’s still about moving the body with the flow. Still about keeping tuned to a sixth sense. Everything in control. Just pushing the air aside to pass. Don’t disturb too much. Keep the memory of everything he passes. Like 360-degree vision. Surround sound. Don’t miss a thing.

So pretty soon, Bobby’s on a roll. Something taking him through some curves. If the cuz is back home channel surfing, this must be barrio surfing. Next minute he’s in the woods: Holly, Brent, Ingle, and West woods. Then it’s the beaches: Manhattan, Redondo, Huntington, Hermosa, Topanga, Seal, and Long. Then it’s the parks: Echo, Leimert, Griffith, Elysian, Monterey, and MacArthur. Then the hills: Beverly and Rolling. The saints: Monica, Bernardino, Ana, Gabriel, Pedro, Marino and Fernando. The Las: Crescenta, Canada, Habra, Mirada, and Puente. And the Els: Segundo and Monte. And finally, the big Los.

It’s getting dark. Big Los twinkling like a shimmering sequined dress at a quinceañera. Clouds of smoke and haze getting those orange and purple stripes of sunset. Looking like a gigantic mural. Órale.
