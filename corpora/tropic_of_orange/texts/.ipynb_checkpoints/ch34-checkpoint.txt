Bobby eyeballs the Visa card drag itself through the slit. Jus’ like any Americano. Shopping Tijuana. Chinese connection’s smooth operation. It’s a onetime dumping fee. Free the cuz for half-price. An easy five thou. Put it on the plastic. No muss. No fuss. It’s a complete laundry.

Bobby got ’em down fifty percent. It’s the limit on his Visa. Forget the paperwork. Forget the China to Chinatown deal. Bobby gonna smuggle the cousin across himself. He figures it won’t be even near another five thou. Ten percent of that should do it. She could be his daughter. Who’s gonna know?

Been a while since Bobby brought the wife over. But that was different. He was legal, gonna get married. Just a matter of paperwork. Got him a lawyer to do the business. Her brother Pepe always saying Rafaela got lucky. Places ’long the border everybody knows, every woman don’t get raped, she don’t pass. The price she pays. Next up from the women, it’s the poor Indian types. They don’t know the language, don’t know the ropes. It’s gonna be the border rats robbing them. Cross the river. Make a run for it down Zapata Canyon. Lose their money. Their shoes. The clothing off their bodies. Maybe nobody gonna see these folks again. Bunch come floating up the river. It’s a fourteen mile zone. All lit up. It’s a fiesta. Maybe you needing gloves for the trip. Work the barbed wire. Maybe a little barbecue pollo for your last supper. Chiclets? Somebody given up crossing’s selling it to you for a price. On the other side, the migra arrests 1,000 per night. Puts the chivos under thermal imaging. It’s high technology with a revolving door. If you lucky, Border Patrol chases you down. Puts you in a wagon and dumps you back. But maybe you gonna be one of them gets shot.

Bobby checks out the market. It’s $100 to cross the river. $350 to cross I-5. $500 gets you all the way to L.A. Bobby figures the cuz gets across like his daughter. But just in case, he gets some documentation. Birth certificate. That should do it.

“What’s your name?”

“You don’t know my name?” The cousin looks worried. Maybe her problems aren’t over. Maybe this skinny man’s a bad man.

“They say your name’s Xiayue, but that could be a phony name.”

“That is my name.”

“Are you related to me?” Bobby takes a close look. He looks at her sad eyes.

“I don’t know. Are you my uncle?”

“I don’t know. But now I am your father. You must call me father now. That is how we are going to get across.”

“I am already across. They got me off the boat.”

“It’s not the final destination. Where did you think you were going?”

“America.”

“So you still have to cross the border. Actually, it’s right over there.” Bobby points north. “Not far at all.”

“My brother said he would meet me there. That’s where there’s work for him. He said he’d find me.”

“Well, maybe he made it. You never know.” Bobby’s looking at Xiayue’s long pigtails. “Maybe we’ve got to cut these off. It’s not the style. We need to get you some other clothing too.”

“My brother knew how to swim. I know how to swim too. I should have jumped with him.” Kid looks fierce.

Bobby don’t know about the brother, but maybe she’d’ve made it. Bobby’s thinking she’s tough, but he’s still asking the questions. “Why did you come along? Why didn’t you stay home?”

“There’s only my brother and me. My parents are both dead. I would have to come sooner or later. That’s what they said. I came sooner.”

Bobby thinks for some, there’s a plan. For others, there’s none. Like the cuz here. The brother’s gonna work. Work like all the celestials before him. Put down rail ties. Pick oranges. Wash shirts. Sew garments. Stir-fry chop suey. This li’l celestial here, there’s no plan. She just came sooner. Bobby’s thinking what kinda plan he had when he was her age. When he stepped off the plane. It wasn’t any plan either. Just gonna survive was all. Now he’s thinking what’s the plan now? Still no plan. Rafaela said pretty soon he was gonna work himself to death. Was that the plan? Rafaela didn’t want to watch him die. So she left.

In the U.S., can’t work much if you’re twelve. So right away, he’s sixteen. Li’l brother gets put in school. Teacher finds out there’s no mom or pop. Who’s signing your report card? Teacher finds out it’s a twelve-year-old parent. Like parachute kids except the folks’s poor. Makes Bobby quit work and go to school, too. Puts the boys up and sends them to school. They go to school with the Mexicans and the centroamericanos. Even get some religion at La Placita. That’s why Bobby gets a latinoamericano education. Gets in good with the vatos locos. A taste of la vida loca. Who’d a thought? But that was the plan, wasn’t it? Surviving. Maybe he and the little cuz on the same plan. Getting by. It’s no plan at all.

Bobby takes the little cuz to a T.J. beauty shop. Get rid of the pigtails. Get rid of the Chinagirl look. Get a cut looking like Rafaela. That’s it. Now get her a T-shirt and some jeans and some tennis shoes. Jeans say Levi’s. Shoes say Nike. T-shirt says Malibu. That’s it.

Border’s nothing but desks and lines of people on linoleum floors. Bobby’s in line like one more tourist. He’s got the cuz holding a new Barbie doll in a box, like she bought it cheap in T.J. Official eyeballs Bobby’s passport and waves them through. That’s it. Two celestials without a plan. Drag themselves through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.
