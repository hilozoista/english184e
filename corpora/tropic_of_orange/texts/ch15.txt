Bobby got time to kill. Time before he meets the Chinatown snakehead gonna set his cousin free. Still don’t know this cousin. Got a call in to Singapore. Better talk to the folks. Find out the truth. Meantime, Bobby got time to kill. Hang out round the Chinese pharmacy. Check out the goods. Ginseng. $98.98/lb. On sale. Tangui. $8.89/lb. On sale. Woman’s root. Been some time, Bobby took Rafaela to Chinatown. Made her take tangui tea. After that, Sol got born. Got born fast. This time, check out a recipe to stop smoking. Maybe they got something like that. Sure enough. Shen qi jie yan ling. Miraculous Stop Smoking.

Bobby looking at the photo plan. They got a Plan A for thirty-five bucks and a Plan B for thirty-five bucks. Difference is in the photo sizes. A, you get two 8 × 10s, ten wallets, and eight 4 × 5s. B, you get one BIG ONE, ten wallets, and eight 4 × 5S. First married, he took Rafaela over and got the B plan with the big photo, 12 × 15. He wanted one big for himself. Then, when Sol’s born, they went back. Got another Plan B with a 12 × 15 of Sol. Put them in frames. On the wall in the hallway. Both of them still there in the hallway, staring back, looking beautiful. Big as life. 12 × 15. His whole life, staring back. Plan B.

Next door, there’s the clothing. Fancy stuff. Not just made in Taiwan. Styled in Taiwan. Silk shirt. Looks silk but maybe polyester. Black and white. Pleated job. Down the pleats, it’s open like vents. Show some skin. Got these black ribbon strips to hold the openings together. Skinny tough guy like Bobby look bad in digs like these. Bad for a Singapore Chinese. Bad if you live in Phnom Penh, Bangkok, or Ho Chi Minh City. Something scarce however for a cholo like Bobby. Life coulda been different. Coulda been hanging with the boys in Singapore with a black-and-white silk shirt with slits. Just like this one. Showing some skin. Looking like the Asian dude in the poster. Two Asian beauties in tight dresses puckering up to either side. Suave sophisticated. Fingering a cigarette. Some brand named 555. Says it in English: Where smoothness is everything. Coulda been smooth. Don’t matter now. Bobby given up smoking. That’s it. Plan B.

Next stop, it’s a video store. Chinese videos. Some’s Hong Kong. Some’s Vietnam. Some’s Thai. Some’s Cambodia. Action/Adventure. Kung Fu. Gangster. Romance. Bobby thinks Action/Adventure maybe. This way you get the Kung Fu and some story. Chow Yun-fat. He’s the man. That’s it. Then there’s Erotic. Cover posters with naked women. Got their heads pulled back, cat eyes narrowed to slits, tongues just slipping through their teeth. Men got their backs to the poster or maybe their sides, pawing the women, making it happen. Everybody’s looking hot and steamy. Coulda taken these near the giant pots of boiling noodles, over giant woks with bok choy and peanut and sesame oil, back of a Chinese kitchen. It’s hot. A real workout. Still it makes Bobby itch. He could use some action. Man, he could really use some action. No sex. No smoking. He’s dying. Any video will do. Maybe make it worse. But how could it get worse? One Action/Adventure. One Erotic. That’s it.

Bobby’s time to kill is up. He’s gotta meet the snakehead. Get a stall in a restaurant. Second stall on the right. No one there yet. Bobby orders tea. He could order a beer, but he doesn’t. Against his rules. Beer for after hours only. Lately, though, he could screw the rules.

Man slips in the stall. Slips in from nowhere like maybe he works in the kitchen. Like he’s a snakehead. Nods. Speaks Mandarin smooth. Speaks friendly like he knows Bobby and always has. Like he knows the family. Maybe he does. He’s got a picture of the cousin. Puts the photo down in front of Bobby like a trump card.

Bobby wants to cry, but he remembers to look cold. It’s not a he. It’s a she. Photo looks like his sister. That’s right. It’s a girl cousin. But how come it looks like his sister? Can’t be. Sister used to look like this. Sister’s older than him by ten years. So who’s this? Bobby says, “Don’t know her.”

“Funny. She looks like you.”

“How old is she?”

“Only twelve.”

“How come she’s alone? Where’s her family?”

“There was a brother. Nineteen. The Lucky Golden Dragon couldn’t dock. Looked like it was going back to China. He was desperate. Left all his belongings with this sister and jumped ship just off the coast of Baja. Maybe he could swim. Maybe not. Never found him. Body never turned up. Maybe the sharks got him.”

“Then who wrote this letter?” Bobby takes out the letter.

“What does it matter? The information is reliable, isn’t it?”

Bobby’s thinking. Older sister had some kids, but these can’t be them. Sister’s in Singapore. Maybe it’s a trick. Fake picture.

Snakehead says, “She could be your sister or even your daughter. The resemblance is amazing. Are you from Fuzhou?”

“When was this picture taken?”

“Just before departure. Passport picture.”

“Passport? If it were a passport picture, she’d be here already.”

“If her brother hadn’t jumped ship, she’d be here. Now who’s going to guarantee for her? Who’s going to pay her way?”

“She’s a girl. She didn’t cost anything. Everyone knows you bring in the girls free.”

“This one was guaranteed by the brother. She wasn’t going to be a prostitute. Such a shame. All alone. So young. Unspoiled. A very nice girl. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to abandon her.”

Bobby don’t fall for this talk. “You said he left all his belongings with her. Probably left enough to buy her freedom.”

“Some clothing. Books. Mementos. Poor people. Besides, if you bring anything of value on a trip like this, it will be stolen.”

Bobby don’t believe it. “How did you find my name?”

“It was written in a book in his things. There’s a letter as well.” Snakehead spreads a folded piece of paper out. Chinese characters Bobby can still read pretty well. It’s his dad’s handwriting. The same as always. The letter says to look up his son in America. Here’s the address. Good to have friends. One shouldn’t be alone.

Still Bobby remembers to look cold. The price is too high. Anyone knows the price at the border. Five hundred dollars max to cross by car. Fake documents. Door-to-door service. But that’s the Mexican price.

“Ten thousand is too much,” Bobby says.

“Ten thousand is cheap. She cost us a boat trip. Every day she’s eating. We could stick you for the brother, too. He owes us thirty. To be frank, either we unload her on you, or we just unload her.”

“Where is she?”

“She’s safe. Tijuana. Waiting. Waiting for your answer.”

“Let me see her first.”

“It will cost you. Better to pay now. We’ll have her here next week. From today, every day you make us wait, it will cost you. Room and board.”

“How do I know she’s real? Anyone can come up with a picture and a letter.”

“Maybe I’m wasting my time. Maybe she’ll just have to take her chances.”

“How much to see her?”

“Five hundred.”

“Too much. I’ll give you two.”

“Four hundred.”

“Three.” Bobby pulls out three big ones.

Snakehead nods. “Walk through the gates to the Mexican side from the end of the line at San Ysidro. Stand at the corner to one side of the taxi stop. Tomorrow. Noontime.”

“Give me her picture.”

Snakehead shrugs. Hands Bobby the letter too. What’s it to him. Easy ten thou. Slips out.

Snakehead said tomorrow. What day’s today? Wednesday; 24th. Second mortgage due 24th of every month. Take it out of his checking. Where’s he gonna get ten thou? Gotta be another way. Rafaela might know. She could help. Rafaela knows Tijuana.

Bobby stares at the photo looking like his sister when she was a kid. Even if she’s not blood connection, she sure looks it. Bobby tries to feel cold, and he can look cold, but he’s not like that. Rafaela knows this. He knows she knows this. So why’d she disappear? But he’s not gonna cry. Walks out to the street. Got to get something to eat. Down the corner, there’s a sign: Chinese burritos. Fish tacos. Ensopada. Camarón chow mein. Hoy Especial: $2.99. Comida to go. Por qué no?

Bobby’s got the takeout, the medicinal herbs, the Miraculous Stop Smoking, the photo, the letter, and the two videos. He gets it all in the house, past the security door and the dead bolt. Gets the water boiling, the tea steeping, the takeout nuked. Studies the letter. Stares at the photo. Twelve years old. So? He was twelve when he came. Tea don’t go with the takeout. Chinese burritos. Chinamex. Who they trying to kid? But it’s not bad. Probably need to change the diet too. Tea don’t work with this food. But it’s not bad. Unwraps another. Gets it nuked, too. Gets a video in the machine. Check out the Erotic. Check out the messages. Eleven messages. All asking about trabajo de limpieza. Still working that wrong number. Nothing from Rafaela. Nothing. Trabajo de limpieza? Trabajo de limpieza? Everybody’s asking. If there’s work, they want to do it. Got families to feed. Got rent to pay. Got dreams. Got hope.

He’s sipping his tea and sniffing the Miraculous Stop Smoking. Medicinal. Smells like every herb in the pharmacy. Taking long deep breaths. Adjusting the yin. Adjusting the yang. Gonna lose that smoking urge. Meanwhile, the erotic video gets to brass tacks fast. Licking and humping. Working the hips. Working the thighs. Pressing the breasts. Sucking the nipples. Pumping the buttocks. Trabajo de limpieza? Se busca trabajo de limpieza? Pumping. Breathing deep. Working. Hard. Adjusting the yin. Adjusting the yang.
