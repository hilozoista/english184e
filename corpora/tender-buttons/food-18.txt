BUTTER. 

Boom in boom in, butter. Leave a grain and show it, show it. I spy. 

It is a need it is a need that a flower a state flower. It is a need that a state rubber. It is a need that a state rubber is sweet and sight and a swelled stretch. It is a need. It is a need that state rubber. 

Wood a supply. Clean little keep a strange, estrange on it. 

Make a little white, no and not with pit, pit on in within.
