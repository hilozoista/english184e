A LONG DRESS. 

What is the current that makes machinery, that makes it crackle, what is the current that presents a long line and a necessary waist. What is this current. 

What is the wind, what is it. 

Where is the serene length, it is there and a dark place is not a dark place, only a white and red are black, only a yellow and green are blue, a pink is scarlet, a bow is every color. A line distinguishes it. A line just distinguishes it.
