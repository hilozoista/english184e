CUPS. 

A single example of excellence is in the meat. A bent stick is surging and might all might is mental. A grand clothes is searching out a candle not that wheatly not that by more than an owl and a path. A ham is proud of cocoanut. 

A cup is neglected by being all in size. It is a handle and meadows and sugar any sugar. 

A cup is neglected by being full of size. It shows no shade, in come little wood cuts and blessing and nearly not that not with a wild bought in, not at all so polite, not nearly so behind. 

Cups crane in. They need a pet oyster, they need it so hoary and nearly choice. The best slam is utter. Nearly be freeze. 

Why is a cup a stir and a behave. Why is it so seen. 

A cup is readily shaded, it has in between no sense that is to say music, memory, musical memory. 

Peanuts blame, a half sand is holey and nearly.
