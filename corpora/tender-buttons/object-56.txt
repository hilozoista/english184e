A SHAWL. 

A shawl is a hat and hurt and a red ballon and an under coat and a sizer a sizer of talks. 

A shawl is a wedding, a piece of wax a little build. A shawl. 

Pick a ticket, pick it in strange steps and with hollows. There is hollow hollow belt, a belt is a shawl. 

A plate that has a little bobble, all of them, any so. 

Please a round it is ticket. 

It was a mistake to state that a laugh and a lip and a laid climb and a depot and a cultivator and little choosing is a point it.
