Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter.I had this idea, after watching the Gettysburg Battle scene in YouTube of the movie Gettysburg. So I had the idea of what if Harry was raised by Robert E. Lee. So I decided to make this story. The story is Â½ of actual history and Crossover of Gettysburg/ Gods  Generals for at least book 1, on each chapter label will Bk 1-6, which is the number book your on. I already a lot of ideas for the story, so I hope you enjoy.In a small House in Godric's Hallow, England; a couple was having a talk that would change the world forever. A talk that would change the course of the future. They at first thought that it was a bad idea, and that it would make the situation they are dealing with worse, but after a few talks and events that happened in the recent past, now they began to talk about and make a final decision that will be the turning point of the war; they are now dealing with now.The couple was in the kitchen discussing about the subject, while having dinner."Lily, are you sure?" asked a man that has hair as black as ebony that was kind of messy, glasses, and hazel eyes."Yes, James. I'm sure. Just think on what will happen if Voldemort finds us and Harry survives, what will happen to him, if we're dead? I trust Sirius, but I know Dumbledore will put Harry with Petunia and whale of a husband; even if it's against our wishes. Then Harry won't know how to protect himself and go up against Voldemort and kill him once and for all.", said his wife, who has hair that is as red as a rose, emerald colored eyes, and a beautiful face, that is flawless.James thought about it for a minute, and said, "your right, if Harry was put with the Dursley's, he wouldn't be happy and I want our son to be happy when he raised by someone that will care for our son, even if he/she is in the past. I don't even care what they are, as long that they care for Harry as much as we do."His wife smiled, as she was happy to be married to her husband. She walked to him, until her face was about half a foot from his and kissed him hard.When they parted, she whispered in his head, "I'll get the ingredients for the ritual ready, that way it will be ready if Voldemort comes, Harry will be sent to safety eminently."She spun around and walk to her potion ingredients cabinet that is located in her room.While James smiled at the intelligence of his beautiful wife. She always knew on how to solve a problem. He just hopes that they didn't send their son into a timeline where a bloody conflict likes the one their facing right now, if Voldemort comes.September 24, 1848Arlington, Virgina, U.S.AIn a large white mansion, a woman with blue eyes and black hair was sitting in the library reading, while her husband was upstairs asleep soundly, after returning to visit for a few days on leave of the American Army. Which he deserved after about 21 long months of fighting in the War in Mexico, he finally has a break now. She missed her husband, it was lonely for her to raise their 7 children (They didn't have any slaves, her father was the one that has the slaves.); while he was fighting deep into Mexico from Veracruz to Mexico City.She was proud of her Husband's accomplishments; he rose to a higher rank than she saw before he left to the war. Now, he's back and here for the time being. She couldn't think of anything better than having him as a husband. He is always wonderful, ever since she knew him at childhood.She yawned as she closed the book she was reading."Oh, God. I'm so sleepy; it's time I go to bed." She thought, as she walked slowly out of the library and reached the entrance hall, which is near the main staircase.As she passed the large double door, she heard a loud, "BANG." This sounded like a canon had gone off nearby.She rushed to the door, and opened it; she looked around the front yard and saw nothing that looked like a battle was happing. She began to be confused; she swore that she heard a loud bang not long ago. At first she thought she was hearing things, until she heads the sounds of a baby giggling at the porch. She looked down below her; she saw a basket with a baby inside it that has the most beautiful Green eyes, she has ever seen, a little black hair, and a scar that shaped like lighting that had also blood on it. On the side of the basket she saw a letter on it, with "TO WHOEVER GETS THIS "on it.She grabbed the letter to see if she can find out why was the baby here. She broke the seal that closed it, and then opened it as she read the letter.To Whoever Gets This LetterYour probably wondering why you found a baby abounded in your house. To be truthful, he's not really abounded, he was sent to you; so that he can be raised by someone who will care for in the past. If you my baby found in a time before 1981 then the ritual I did has succeeded. The reason is because there is a Dark Lord in my time that has been starting a war against the British Ministry of Magic, Muggle-Borns, and is basically winning, because the Ministry doesn't know how to fight. Then before our Son was born, a prophecy was made saying that my son is the only one who can destroy the Dark Lord Voldemort (If it's true, then Harry will have some kind of mark). It is most likely me and my Husband have not survive, once you receive Harry. We ask that you teach Harry how to defend himself when he has to come back to his timeline, but that will be when his magic has matured. Once his magic has matured, it is important that he sent back to his original timeline. So he stop Voldemort, because it is likely is still alive looking for Harry in his timeline.We ask is that you and your family take care for our son (his name is Harry James Potter), and look after him, until his Magic Matures (You should know if he starts to glow). When he does, give him the necklace in the basket that is under the blankets and have him say, "There is no place like home."We hope that we have left our son, in good hands. Signed byLily and James PotterShe couldn't believe what this letter is saying, this baby is from the future and that he's a wizard. She knew about the existence of Wizards from her husband; who's a Squib. He had told about a little thing called a time turner, but he never told her about the ability to go back more than 100 years in the past. But what got in her mind was that this child needs a home, until his magic matures. She grabbed the basket with Harry (Who went to sleep, after feeling tired), and turned around and jumped when she saw that her husband was behind her.He was in his bed clothes, and saw what she had in her hand, and asked, "Maratha, what are you ok, I thought I heard a loud canon go off?""Yes, Robert. I'm fine. But what you heard was this child being sent to use from the future. I think you should read this letter that came with the child, before you ask more." She said, as she gave the letter that she still had in her hand to husband.Her husband slowly read the letter, each word made him more and more shocked. When his face went as shocked as it can go.He looked up at his wife and said, "Mary, do you think that it's a good idea? To raise a child that is from the future? There is the possibility of us getting into big trouble.""Yes, Robert. We have to, the couple that sent the boy to us sacrificed they're lives for him to live and be prepared for his coming future." Mary scowled."But Mary, are you sure that we can handle another child, we already 7 kids. I will be harder for us and how are we to teach him how to fight, while I'm busy in the army?" Robert asked, still worried."I'm sure we can come up with something, when the time comes. Now, we have to take care of little Harry as if he is our own son." Mary said, holding baby Harry in her arms, who was asleep and quiet."And what about when we have to tell him that we're not his real parents, how will he react?" her husband questioned."That is something, we will have to discuss for another time, so either you're with me or someone is sleeping in the old rocking chair, tonight in the cold night." His wife threatens with fire in her eyes glaring at him.Robert sighed; he could tell that his wife is serious. He had known her for many years and can tell when she's serious with those fire-burning eyes that are glaring at him.He nodded, as his wife said, "Good, now. I'm going to put him in Milly's Infant bed, you go back to sleep and tomorrow we can tell the kids, during breakfast about little Harry."Robert nodded and said, "Alright, then I guess that it's better for him to be raised by us than a family that hates anything to deal with magic, one could imagine what could happen if someone rose by that kind of people."His wife smiled and kissed him in the cheek, as she climbed up stars with little Harry. Smiling to have another child in her life. While her husband sighed, he thought 7 crazy kids running around were enough, now 8. He was pretty sure that by the time Harry turns 17, he would go white and really old, older than his actual age.He went to back up the stairs, dragging himself to bed, while his wife was tending to Harry.Before he fell asleep, his thought of one thing."8 is enough, no more."

October 17, 1859In a Forest off Arlington, Virginia, an 11 year old with glasses that are Rectangular shaped, hair that is as black as ebony, Emerald eyes, a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, Tall about 4 ft 7in (a little too tall for an average 11 year old, though the shocking thing is looked like a 14 years old.), wearing a three-piece suit with rounded collar, lapel peaks, and round frilled open collar. He was holding a musket with its barrel facing up at the sky; he looked at his target in front of him (Which is a small tree with a red circle.)He pulled out a paper cartridge out of his left pocket, and tears the top of the cartridge with his teeth. He slowly pours the powder that was in the Paper Cartridge down the barrel. Then he pulled out the bullet or mostly called the "minie ball", which is also inside the Paper Cartridge, and placed it inside the barrel, the tip pointing up. He pulled out the ram rod and ram the bullet down a few times; placed it back in its holder and pulled the hammer back, then placed a Percussion Cap on the spot below the hammer.He then held the Musket to his shoulder, aiming at the red circle on the tree. He carefully aimed at the red circle, breath slowly and holding the musket still. As he took another small breath, he pulled the trigger, where the hammer hit the percussion cap and ignited the gun powder, launching the bullet to the target. The boy didn't see if he hit his target, while he fixed his bayonet onto his musket. He gave a yell and charge to the tree with speed as fast as a bullet. His Bayonet impacted the red circle, right at the right of the red circle.He pulled the bayonet out of the tree and saw the hits he got on the tree. The bullet hit right at the center of the circle. The boy marveled at his accuracy. As he heard the sound of clapping behind, he turned around and saw his farther clapping.With a Black beard, Grey eyes, a Brown jacket, and a Brown leather hat."Good work, James." His father cheered, as he is son smiled. His father always called him James, he given a different named for his Brothers and Sisters."Thanks Dad." James replied. Happy to have him as his father."I noticed that you hit the circle to your right intentionally, may I ask why?" His father asked, curiously."Because even though I hit the tree in the middle with the Bullet, there is a possibility that if it was an enemy soldier that he survives the bullet and so he would have time to shoot meet with a pistol as I reload to shoot the next enemy soldier; but if I bayonet stab him in his left, I would be stabbing him in the heart and then he would die instantly.", James explained.His father chuckled, "Yes, your right. Good work, Son. I can see you have a good future head with those tactics in the Army."James smiled."Come on, James. Let's head back to the house, or else your Mother will hit me again with the broomstick. I maybe in the army for many victorious years, but your mother am someone you never want to get angrily."As the faced the direction of the mansion, a man in an Army Uniform, riding a white horse heading towards them.As he stopped in front of his father, he said, "Colonel Lee, your order by President Buchanan to head to Harpers Ferry, to stop a raid lead by John Brown, who has captured the Armory there.""Very well, just let me bring my son home and put in my uniform, and I will be there as soon as I can.", James's father said."There isn't time, Colonel. The President wants you there now, you'll have to bring your son with you." the man on the horse explained."Very well. Harry?"Harry looked up at his father."I'm not going to argue with you, so you'll come with me."Harry smiled, as he knew he would get his first experience in war, though it really isn't a war, just a situation.Then his father turned to the man in the horse, and said, "I want you to inform my wife about the situation and that James will be coming with me. I'll bring him back home, as soon as it is over.""Yes, Colonel." The man said as he rode to the Mansion."Come on, James."Harry nodded, as he followed his father to horse's that was tied to a Tree. Harry got on "Traveler", his favorite horse, whose is as brown as mud; while his father got on "Lucy", who is as white as snow. Harry had learned how to ride a horse since he was 5, so he knew how to ride. Harry was still smiling as they were riding to Harper's Ferry, knowing that he would experience seeing a battle for the first time.October 18, 1859The next morning, after non-stop horse riding and marching James, his father, and the division of Marines behind them, finally made it to Harpers Ferry. It was about 58 miles, but it was hard to go through the forest to take a short cut with Foot Soldiers, the road to Harpers Ferry goes to many towns and would take longer. Though Harry was tired, he couldn't wait to see the battle that was to come. Harry could see the town from high up in the Loudoun Heights. There was a bridge that connected to the town through the Shenandoah River in front of him; to his far right was a railroad bridge that connects the town over the Potomac River.He could the ruins of what James guessed was a Cotton Factory, since he saw a Cotton Mill near it. At the Potomac River side of the town, he could see shots being fired at a small engine's house. The windows were all barred up; the town's citizens were surrounding the small engine house. So James had guessed that is where John Brown is hiding at. The town's people had guns, pitchforks, hammers, anything that can kill a human being."Come on, we still have to get the town." His father ordered to him and the Marines behind them.They hurried to the bridge over the Shenandoah River, as they crossed it; they were greeted by Town for coming in this troublesome time. People were cheering them and welcoming them. Harry was a little happy, but he was anxious to see the coming battle.Then they came up a couple of men, one had a brown leather hat, while the other had a long white beard."Good evening, Colonel Lee. I'm John Marks.", said the one with the hat, "The man with the white beard is my uncle William Marks. We're the commanders of the militia stationed here.""Good evening, Commanders. You already know who I am, but let introduce my youngest son. His name is Harry James Lee. He about 15, he wants to join the army when he's older, so I thought about bringing him here." Colonel Lee introduced."It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lee.", John said, shaking Harry's hand."What's the situation so far?" Harry's father asked."Sir, we managed to trap John Brown in that engine house, he has hostages in that engine house, and one of them is Colonel Washington. The mayor is dead along with a few other citizens of the town. we managed to kill some Brown's men, but Brown is still shooting and has plenty of ammo from capturing the Armory yesterday, which we forced him out.", William explained."Yes, we will have send out a truce; to see if Brown will surrender, if not then Lt. Israel Greene will lead the marines to storm the Engine House. But if you like that role? Then, I do not mindâ¦""No, sir. You can. Most of the Militia is tired and can't go on for now." said John."Very well." His father said instructed to a marine, "send a flag of truce to Brown ask him to surrender and if he doesn't the Marines will storm the Engine House.""Yes, Colonel Lee." replied the Marine."James.", his father called."Yes, Dad?" James asked."You are to help guard the Railroad Bridge at the Potomac River, take a Company of Marines with you." His father ordered."Yes, Sir." James replied."Colonel Lee, Are you sure that is a good idea to send your son with a Company marines to the railroad bridge, the Engine House is about a block away? He's about 15, a little too young for that kind of duty." asked William."Mr. Marks, I assure you that my son is up to the duty and that he will have no trouble handling It.", James's father explained."Yes, Dad. I can handle it.", James said, though he was a little said that he wouldn't see any action."Good, 5th Maryland Marines Company follow James to the bridge." His Father ordered."Yes, sir." said the Captain in charge of the Company."5th Maryland, Forwardâ¦ March.", James ordered, as he rode on Traveler to the bridge.The Company slowly marched following James to the Bridge.An hour laterHarry was disappointed; he still didn't get any action as he was guarding the Bridge. About 20 minutes ago, a truce was sent to John Brown to surrender or be stormed by Marines. Brown determined of whatever his goal is, refused. So Brown got surrounded by Marines, right now the Marines are now trying to ram the door down to get in. The battle was over right away, and Harry only saw the only shoots fired were when he arrived.He didn't want to argue about it, because his Father once told him that a soldier always does his duty, even if it isn't what they wanted. So he decided to let it go and hope the opportunity for another fight to come."Son?" He heard his father call for him.He turned around saw his dad, and said, "Yes, Dad?""I know you're not happy of guarding the bridge, even though it was near the Engine House; but let me tell you why?", his father said, "There could have been a chance that Brown would have escaped to the railroad Bridge, and straight to you."That made James feels a little better that there could have been a possibility that Brown would have tried to escape here, and would run into him. Though he realized it would have been better that he was captured at the Engine House, or else more lives would be lost. Then James thought about it, it was probably better that the fight didn't come his way."Yes, sirChapter will come soon, i'm still working on it. it will probably come sometime next week. so until then, give me some ideas or your opinion of the story so far.

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER/GODS AND GENERALS.In April of 1861 in Lexington, Virginia you could see students of a Military Institute drilling outside of the Institute, while wearing gray uniforms and bronze straps with medals. While inside of the Institute you could see in one of the classrooms, a teacher was talking to his students with disappointment. He had a long beard, a mustache that touched the beard, blue eyes, and a face that shows that one must not mess with him. Unless they want to suffer the consequences."Gentlemen", he said with a stern tone," if you are going to succeed at this institution then you have one common goal. To learn your lesson, if you're energies elsewhere and you will not either with me or in your career is as military officers. I had hoped that with the proper grasp of the artillery principles that I have laid before you today that you would learn to apply these principles with a great effectiveness in your own field experiences but since only Cadet Lee managed to cto grasp these principles. "He looked around at each student with disappointment, except 13 year old Cadet Lee (who actually looks like about 18 years old)."I am forced to conclude that I must repeat the lesson tomorrow, word for word." He said. As the other cadets showed shocked faces that almost all of them dropped their jaws to their desks, as he repeated," Word for Word."While Cadet Lee was happy, he studied hard to pass the lesson as he also learned from his father. He has only been here for a few months and now he's doing amazing. He still wondered how his father managed to get him here, all he had to do was send a letter to a congressman to get some support. Though the only problem he had at the Institute was that some the other cadets at the Institute were insulting him and calls him names like: Jamie Lee, Know It All, Young Blue Light, etc. usually when Maj. Jackson(who they also call him Old Blue Light, Old Fool, Old Jack, etc.) wasn't looking during class or after class. Though James Lee had no problem with it and ignored it, knowing that one day they would be under his command and regret it. He won hurt them or worse, just give them positions that they wouldn't like.Though not too much during the time of war, because in order to win a battle the Army one commands must be loyal to their ranking higher officers. That was one of the lessons his father has taught him, who is in Washington for some reason, right now. His father didn't say why though, he assumed that it had something to do with the newly formed Confederate States of America that is at war with the United States.But before he could think more about it, he heard the yell of the "Secession" coming from the outside. He could tell everyone else heard it, because the rest of the cadets went up to the window to see what was going on. While James walked to Maj. Jackson, who was looking from the window as James joined him and watched as he saw what was going on. Outside of the Institute, you could see a group of people: professors, staff, and even cadets were crowding around the flagpole that that was flying the Stars And Stripes. They kept yelling "Secession" as they got closer and closer to the flagpole, then one of the cadets lowered the Stars And Stripes down to the ground as one of the cadets played tug-of-war with another cadet over the flag."Class dismissed." Maj. Jackson announced as a different flag was hoisted on the flagpole. James took note of the flag that was hoisted. They had nine white stars in a circle formation in the middle of a blue square at the upper left of the flag, while the remaining part of the flag had three Horizontal bars: the first red, the second White, and the last Red again. James recognizes the flag as the Confederate flag, also called The Bars and Stars. The crowd cheered when the flag flew proudly on the flagpole.James tried to look away, trying to not believe that the war would come here to his native State. But he knew that he was wrong, because Virginia was what he and his father called as well as many people up north," Cotton States". Which are states that have the institution of slavery, which is what powers the high production of the cotton industry. James and his father always had a distaste for slavery. It is a curse that ruins a nation, is what causes the pain in separations of families that had done no wrong.Though he knew that other people had different ideas about slavery, thinking that God had made Negroes (or in James opinion African-Americans) in slavery and that ending slavery was an insult to God. James disagreed, thinking that people misunderstood the Bible, like people misunderstood about witchcraft. He could give a good example about the subject: Salem, Massachusetts; which is known for its witch trials (Which none of the people killed were Witches. Just people were pointing fingers at people before the United States was formed and is still dealing with its humiliation, today."Cadet Lee?" He heard someone called.James turned around away from the window and saw that it was Maj. Jackson that called for him."Yes?" James said with a salute.Maj. Jackson saluted back as he said," mind if you have a walk with me, I wish to talk to you about something?"James blinked for a minute wondering what Maj. Jackson wanted to talk about and said," no, sir. I have no problem with that.""Good, follow me ", Maj. Jackson said.James nodded, and follows him as they walked outside; they could still see the crowd cheering and kept yelling "Secession" as the Bars and Stars were flying proudly. James could tell that the possibility that the war would come to Virginia had affected the Major, because he swore that he saw a frown on the Majors face as he kept staring at the new flag, then he stopped as he heard a person that called for his name. James turned the same time as the Major to see who it was."Sir." Major said as he saluted, as James saluted to. Even though he didn't know the teacher.The teacher saluted back as he walked closer to Maj. Jackson talk to him."Major, listen to them." He said pointing to the crowd with a paleface that had a couple of tears," the leaders of our intellectual future, screaming for the destruction of our nation.""Sir, President Lincoln raising the troops." Maj. Jackson replied.James nodded, agreeing with the Major. He read about that on the Richmond Times, where Pres. Lincoln requested a total of 75,000 volunteers to suppress the Confederate States. Many states agreeing to, but Virginia and a few other southern states refused to. James didn't sign up in any state up north, because 1: He was too young to, 2: He wasn't sure that his father would approve, and 3: There was no doubt that Virginia would secede from the union and join the Confederacy. The third problem was the one that convinced him not to enlist."I... I will not stay in a place, where my students dishonor their country's flag. Major, I'm leaving for Pennsylvania tomorrow." The teacher said."War is the sum of all evils, but all I know and all I have is to the service to my home, my country." Maj. Jackson pointed out.That shocked James, as that made his final decision even though he already made it, but it convinced him even more. As he would not want to fight against the Major, he considered the Major as a second father. No, he would not fight with the union. He would fight with the Confederacy, with the Major. He hoped that his father would understand."Your country, Thomas?" The teacher said shocked," your country, my country is all one. Is all one Thomas, all one."He sighed as he walked away, obviously to pack up for his new home in Pennsylvania.James felt sorry for the poor guy, as Maj. Jackson said," Cadet Lee?"James turned around and answered," yes, sir?""What do you plan to do, if Virginia secedes and joins the Confederacy?"James blinked for a second answered," Sir, I plan to join Virginia, until my dying day."Maj. Jackson smiled and said," good, I'll be happy to know that I will be fine alongside you for Virginia.""Thank you, sir. It is an honor to fight alongside you as well." James said as he saluted to Maj. Jackson.Maj. Jackson saluted as he looked at his watch," you best be hurrying to the train station, you're train that takes you back to Arlington leaves in about 30 minutes."James nodded as he remembered that gets to visit his family today for next 3 days, as he said," Thanks you sir, please give my compliments to Mrs. Jackson."Maj. Jackson nodded as James left to the train station faster than a speeding bullet.It took about four hours for the Train to reach Arlington, because it had to stop at Richmond first to pick up more passengers and then head to Arlington. James was wiped after the long trip and couldn't wait to reach home. He missed his Brothers, Sisters, Mother, and Father. He hasn't seen them since Christmas season, he rubbed his eyes. It had hurt him to leave his Family, now he was back to stay for the night and then return to the Institute. Though he didn't mind one bit, at least he'd get the chance to meet his family again.He stepped out of the carriage that picked him up from Train Station, as the carriage stopped near the house. James walked up to the driver and gave him a Double Eagle coin ($20 in gold), as he also said, "thank you."The Carriage driver nodded and left to back to downtown Arlington, As James walked to the front porch. He knocked on the door, and waited a few seconds for the door to open. Which slowly did to show that it was one of his Brothers, Robert E. Lee Jr., though he and most of his family call him Rob. He had brown hair as his mother, grey eyes, and a kindly face."James, it's so good to see you. Mom's going to be excited." Rob said as he hugged James.James smiled as he hugged his brother back, as he said, "It's good to see you too, brother. How's Mom doing anyway?""She's doing better, though she's been missing you.", Rob answered.James smiled as he hugged his brother back, as he said, "It's good to see you too, brother. How's Mom doing anyway?""She's doing better, though she's been missing you." Rob answered.James smiled, happy to know that his mother was okay. It was only a few years ago that his mother had to be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. James couldn't help, but worry about his mother. She had never been the same person after that. Luckily she had the company of James's for Sisters: Mary, Anne, Eleanor, and Mildred. He missed them as well, while he was at VMI."Are the others here?" James asked.Rob smiled and said," yes, and even fathers here; he just got home."James smiled even more; he hasn't seen his father since he left to VMI. Now he couldn't wait to see him."Where is he?" James asked."I think he's in the Dining Room, we were just about to have dinner. We know that you were coming or mom would have waited for you.""It's okay, besides I wanted to surprise mother anyway." James said.Rob as he said," you're going to drive mom crazy one of these days.""Alright, but hope that mom doesn't burst your eardrums." Rob replied with a smirk. As he turned around and led James to the Dining Room.James absolutely missed the place, as he passed all the beautiful paintings that his mother made. She did a really good job on them; they were so amazing that you would feel as if you were part of the paintings. He passed one that his mother had painted of him and his father in one picture when he was about 7 years old, all the pretty colors on it gave him a big smile. James absolutely love them, he couldn't paint as good as his mother. Though painting isn't his thing, but it did give them some good inspiration."Rob son, who was it?" James heard a very familiar voice in the Dining Room."Well father, it is our very own Harry James Lee.", Rob answered, as he and James walked into the Dining Room.James saw that all the rest of his brothers and sisters were at the Dining Table at the left and right sides, while at the back he saw both his mother and father there as well.He smiled as he said," Hello everyone, sorry that I didn't tell you that I was coming home.""It's no problem, James." Said Anne (his youngest sister), who was as tall as James, Blue eyes, Black hair, and in a very beautiful White Dress; as she went up to hug James."Yeah, Shrimp. Nothing to worry about, except mother of course." Said William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, his second oldest brother. He looked almost like his father, only with Brown hair, Brown beard that was as long as his father's, and Brown Mustache that touched to the beard, and was about 29 years old."In case, if you forgotten William, that I'm right here." Said a very stern voice.William winced and went pale, as James turned to the voice; as his Emerald Green eyes looked into a pair of Blue eyes that James swore he saw fire in them."Umâ¦ Hi mom." James said with a small smile.James's Mother glared even harder at James as she said," Young Man, if you were coming home. How come you didn't at least send a telegraph?"" Because I wanted to surprise you, Mother.", James answered with a very large smile.While most of his brothers and sisters groaned , as this isn't the first time he tried to surprise his mother. While his father was trying not to laugh, as his mother yelled so loud that it could be heard all the away at Washington."HARRY JAMES LEE, THIS IS NOT FUNNY. YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF SURPRISE AND THAT I WOULD HAVE MADE YOUR FAVORITE MEALS FOR DINNER, IF YOU HAD SENT ME A TELEGRAPH. I BET THAT YOU LOVE TORTURING ME LIKE THAT. NOW SIT DOWN AND EAT DINNER WITH US. "James quickly sat down at a chair next to Rob, as he put some Mashed Potatoes and a piece of Stake on his plate. While he watched his mother calmed down, as his father talked to her about something. James looked away as he began eating his Stake, knowing that he must talk to his father after dinner.Then he heard Anne asked his father," Dad?"" Yes, Anne?", He replied." How was it that Washington and what did Pres. Lincoln wanting you for?"" Well, he offered me to the rank of Major General of the Union Army to quell the rebellion in the South."Then came the sound of dropped Forks and Spoons, as though looks of shocked faces came from everyone else in the Dining Room, including James." But doesn't he know the possibility that Virginia will be seceding and join the Confederacy?", James asked." Yes, but he doubts it will happen along with the other Cotton States.", His Father answered.James huffed, obviously President Lincoln doesn't understand the picture of the Southern States. He doesn't hate President Lincoln, it was just that he didn't think that President Lincoln was up to the challenge. He could understand the president's belief to slavery, it was just that the South was too independent on it. James believed that to end slavery was to make the South less independent enough , where the South is as industrialized as the North. There the South would have no need to keep slavery."And what did you say to the offer, Dad?" George Washington Curtis Lee asked, who was the oldest of James's Brothers. He had a Black Mustache, a clean chin, Brown hair, and Ocean Blue eyes that matched his mother's."I said no, because I could not stand knowing that if I accept the offer that I would be fighting against my home state. Then I sent my resignation to the Army and sent my enlistment to the Confederate Government; and now the Virginia Legislator wishes for me to be at the State Capitol tomorrow afternoon.", His father answered." Why?", James asked, curiously." I have no idea, yet.", His father answered.James nodded, as he was a little bit happy to know that he is going to be fighting on the same side as his father against the Union." James?", Asked Eleanor Agnes Lee, who is like 20-year-old copy of her mother." Yes?", James applied, as he finished his Stake." How was it at VMI?", She asked, with a smile." Amazing, I managed to pass the Artillery Principles today with flying colors and the only one to pass the exam.", James answered." That's great, it will come in handy when you join the military.", His father answered with a smile." The Confederate Military?", James asked." If you want to, then yes.", His father answered." Dad?", James asked." Yes?", His father replied." I was thinking about joining the Confederate Army right now, but I won't join without your permission. Is it okay?"Then came the long silence again, as everyone stared at James. While James was wondering what he'd did.As his mother said," But you're too young to join!"" If that's true, mother; then am I too young to be in VMI, right now. Dad, you said yourself, that I look like that I could be about 18. So I could fool the recruiters thinking that I'm of age.", James replied back with a kind voice. As his mother realized that she had nothing to say back." Robert, can I talk to you for a minute?", His mother asked.Robert nodded, as he followed his wife to the library. While leaving their confused Sons and Daughters in the Dining Room." James, are you sure this is what you want to do?", Anne asked, very concerned." Yes, this is what I want to do. I want to devote myself to the duty of my state.", James answered." But James, I know you already pointed this out. Though your 13 years old, 13 year olds, like you, should be chasing around skirts. Not fighting wars!" Said Mildred, who is about 15 years old, brown hair that touches her shoulders, Grey eyes , and a flawless face."Well, I'm not like an ordinary 13-year-old. I'm different." James replied."But what if you don't live through this war?" George asked, trying to persuade James."Then it is an honor to die for my state, as I do not fear the death of myself. As God has set my time of death."Everyone bowed their heads, as they knew that they couldn't change James's mind.Then Anne asked," James will you at least promise to write to us when you can? "James nodded, as the sound of knocking on the Front Door was heard.Rob told everyone that he'll get it, as he went to answer it.While in the library, Mary Curtis Lee stared out at the window watching the beautiful stars that filled the night sky. As the moon was at its full stage. She kept staring with tears running down her eyes, as she felt a pair of hands touched her shoulders. She looked up and smiled, as she saw the handsome face of her husband.She then frown as she said," oh, Robert. I don't want to lose James or any of our children in this war. Especially when James is supposed to return to his time where he belongs in about God knows when. If he is killed in the war, then the world will fall into the hands of that Dark Lord â¦what's his nameâ¦Moldemort...Goldemortâ¦Voldemort, who killed James's real parents and what will they say? Since we only taught him Muggle Warfare and not Magical. Especially since we blocked this magic, so that he won't go to any Magical Schools or else the Union Magical Department will discover that he's not from this time period and do God knows what. We only know that the blocks are breaking and that his Magical Core is getting stronger as he ages. What are we going to do, Robert?"Robert looked deep into his wives beautiful blue eyes as he replied," we let him join in the war. It hurts me as much as it hurts you, but you and I both know that we can't stop them from joining. All we can do is pray to God that his magic matures quickly. When it does, we tell him the truth.""And will he react, when we tell him that we aren't his real parents?" Mary asked, with even more tears running down her eyes."All we can do is hope that he understands and is happy about It.", her husband answered.Mary smiled, as her husband gave a kiss to her cheek; as the sound of knocking came from the Library Door."Come in.", Robert said to whoever was at the other side of the door.He heard the sound of the door opening, as he saw that it was James. He walked up to his parents with a small smile and a telegram in his hand.His father noticed it and asked," what is it, James?"James handed his father telegram, as his father adjusted his glasses. As he read out the whole telegram.To: Cadet Harry James LeeYou are to report to the Institute by tomorrow afternoon (though later than one o'clock) to be joining with the Corps Cadets to help with the training of the Provision Army for defense of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Note: You must be in uniform, when you arrive.Superintended SmithRobert closed his eyes, as he knew that the decision was now made; there was no turning back, now. James is going to join in the war. He only hoped that this war would be over quick and that James would survive. He could tell that his wife was thinking the same thing as she had even more tears in her eyes."James." He said."Yes, Dad?" James asked."Are you sure this is what you want to do? Because I'll see if I can pull you out of VMI." His father asked, looking into James's eyes."Yes, father. This is what I want to do; I want to defend my home and state. Just as you are, father." James answered.Robert nodded sadly, as he said," very well, but I want you to promise me three things.""Yes?" James asked." 1. I want you to be very careful, 2. Not to do any heroes stuff, and 3. After this war is over, I want you to resign and live a different life, if possible."James stared for a minute and then nodded."Good, you might want you to get some sleep? Tomorrow is going to be a big day.", His father said.James nodded, as he left to his bedroom to get some sleep. While his parents stayed in the library for a little bit more, knowing that he was never going to be the same person after this war and that they couldn't get him away from it.Finally, I got this chapter. Sorry. It took so long, I had gotten Type B Flu and didn't have the energy to work on this chapter. Though I managed to do some work for story , like events for that could change the Civil War, some ideas for story ahead to make it perfect, etc. The next Chapter will probably come next weekend, it will be on the 1st Battle of Manassas A.K.A Battle of Bull Run. Also please give some of your ideas for the story or opinions.

DISCLIAMER: I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER/ GODS AND GENERALS.July 21, two months after James last seen his family back at Arlington, James shivered as he knew that soon he would experience his first taste of battle. He knew that this battle with either protect Virginia and the Confederacy from the Yankees or mean the end of the war and the Confederacy's independence. It was no doubt that the Confederate Army of the Potomac (led by Gen. Beauregard) was outnumbered a little bit, even with the reinforcements from Winchester. But that never scared James; as he and Col. Jackson (which is kind of like the equivalent of a Major in the Confederate Army) knew that is not the size of the Army that matters, but the discipline of the Army is what wins today.Things happened so quick for James, after leaving his family at Arlington. he had returned to VMI, and then Corps cadets was sent to a camp near Richmond(the new capital of the Confederacy) for recruiting new regiments and training them. Though when they arrived at the camp, James was given the rank of Captain and was made an Adjutant to Col. Jackson, along with a Capt. Pendleton. James didn't know much about him, but he did know that his father is a Rev. Pendleton, who is also in charge of the four howitzers of the brigade. Though James didn't think about it much, because when he heard that his father was made in charge of the Citizen Army of Virginia it had shocked James so much that he almost fainted.James couldn't help, but be proud of his father. As he knew that he would be seeing him more often. Though he did send a letter of congratulations to his father, he still wrote to his other family members Arlington. As he knew that if he didn't, he would get an angry letter from his mother. Though he did write a letter that would be sent to his family, if he were to die at this battle near Manassas Junction.James stopped thinking of everything, as he followed (as he rode on Traveller, who his father sent him as a good luck present) Col. Jackson, and Capt. Pendleton (who were also on horseback) with Col. Jackson's other adjutants, Across the forest near Henry House Hill to where the brigade was standing at attention and waiting for the order to move forward and take part of the battle that was already happening.James could hear the noise of muskets firing, cannons and howitzers firing, and the yell of soldiers both sides at the other side of the forest. James swore that it sounded like as if hell was let loose. He tried to not think about the battle too much, as he remembered the promise he made to his father. But it didn't mean he would try to die for his state, His beautiful Virginia that he loves so much as much just Col. Jackson does.He looked up to the sky and said softly with his VMI hat on his chest, "O mighty father with your hands, I commend my spirit and pray that you be on our side as we fight on this field to protect the loves and places that we so dearly keep in our hearts."He heard voices behind him say," Amen."He turned around and saw Col. Jackson, Capt. Pendleton, and Dr. McGuire (the brigades field Doctor) with their hats on their left side of the chest's and their heads now down with their eyes closed, he saw the same thing with a few of the men of the brigade."Capt. Lee, thank you for that prayer. As many men in the brigade need it to warm up their hearts." Col. Jackson said to James with a tear in his eye.James nodded, as Col. Jackson gave the order for the brigade to move forward. The men slowly marched up the hill to the top of Henry House Hill with hearts of steel, some were nervous; but had some courage in them. As they reached to the top of the hill, they could see the battle going on. Lines of men both Confederate and Union firing at each other with muskets and cannons. Bodies littered the land below them at Matthews Hill straight ahead. James pulled out his binoculars as Col. Jackson did the same, while Capt. Pendleton had good eyes and recognized one of the brigades at Matthews Hill."That's Gen. Bee's brigade." He said pointing to it.James and Col. Jackson turned their binoculars to where Capt. Pendleton was pointing at. It was pandemonium, as Gen. Bee's brigade was being hit by musket fire and cannon fire all around them. James could tell that soon Gen. Bee's brigade would not hold very long."Kindly inform Gen. Bee that the 1st Virginians are on the field. Ask him if he can hold long enough for me to deploy my men?" Col. Jackson ordered an adjutant next to James.The adjutant nodded and rode as fast as possible to Gen. Bee."They may not hold gentlemen, we must assume that they cannot.", Col. Jackson said, as he gave orders to another adjutant to tell the Regiment Commanders to where he wants each Regiment and the brigades artillery to be placed at on the hill.Time passed by as James watched the regiments of the brigade form up where Col. Jackson ordered them to be placed at. He could see that some were even more nervous as they watch the battle on Matthews Hill raged, but their spirits rose as they cheered when they saw the artillery of the brigade came in position at the center of the hill. James couldn't help, but cheer with them as the artillery was ready to fire and Rev. Pendleton shouted out orders to the men of the artillery of things like: target, Range, shell size, fuse length, etc. then came the loud sound of the artillery firing at the Yankee cannons at the other side of Matthews Hill.James then turned his attention to Gen. Bee's brigade, and saw that they had lost hold of the Confederate lines on Matthews Hill; men were retreating to Henry's House Hill. James was nervous; did this mean the end of the battle and the Confederacy? He then turned to Col. Jackson and saw by a look of his face that this battle is not over by a long shot.Then came a man that James believed to be General Bee, he had a long Brown beard and hair that touched to his shoulders, and Brown eyes."Sir, our lines on Matthews Hill are broken. They're beating us back." He said.All Col. Jackson had said was," Well then, general, we must give them the bayonet."Then Col. Jackson ordered for the brigade to move to a position at the center of the hill and for them to stay low.James then saw Gen. Bee head to his retreating boys. He could barely hear what he was saying."Rally, Men, Rally." General Bee yelled, as he was pointing his sword at the direction of Colonel Jackson, "Look, There's Jackson standing like a Stonewall. Let us determine to die here today and we will conquerâ¦ Rally behind the Virginians." His men cheered as they ran to form behind the Brigade.James was impressed with the courage of the men, as he saw that the Yankee's advancing toward Henry House Hill. There were like thousands of them, marching together getting closer and closer to Henry's House Hill, Following the Yankee Infantry was a Battery (Artillery) Unit closed behind them. They set up bellow the bottom of the hill, as a forth of the numbers of Union Infantry stopped to guard the Artillery; while the rest continued advancing. Some were even already firing as they advanced. Unfortunately, Col. Jackson was hit by a bullet on his left hand."DAMN IT.", He yelled.James rushed to Colonel Jackson and heard him curse. To which surprised him a little, because he had never heard him curse before; but sure enough he did. He was positively sure that it could be heard to all the way at Washington."Colonel, are you hurt badly?" James asked corned."I'm fine, Captain Lee. Just a scratch. I will be fine." Colonel Jackson answered.James nodded, as Colonel Jackson then order to an adjutant to have the Brigade to lie down on the ground. James watch was as the first row of Infantry in each Regiment of the Brigade lay chest down, while the second row kneeled. He then turned around as he saw that the Yankee's were getting even more closer as he saw a large flag of the Stars and Stripes being flown by a man in each Yankee Regiment. As they march with hearts of steel.But the next thing James saw shocked him, it was the 33rd Virginia Regiment (one of the infantry regiments of the brigade that was being engaged by a portion of the Union line of Infantry) charging through the line of Yankees sending them running to Washington, but not for long as the 33rd attack the Yankees manning the Artillery, the Yankees pushed the 33rd back and forced them to retreat with the help of the reserves they had guarding the Artillery."WHAT IN THE HELL WAS GOING THROUGH COLONEL CUMMINGS MIND? CHARGING LIKE THAT WITH HIS REGIMENT, WITHOUT THE REST OF THE BRIGADE AND KNOWING THAT HE HAS NO ORDERS TO ADVANCE." James thought angrily."Colonel, Sir. The Day is going against us." said a Soldier from the retreating 33rd.Colonel Jackson stared at the Soldier and said sternly, "If you think so sir, you better not say anything about it."The Soldier nodded as he ran with the rest of the 33rd to reform behind the Brigade.Then came the sound of drum beat from the Yankees as they continued to advance slowly. James followed Colonel Jackson as he rode to the middle of the Brigade.As he yelled to the Brigade, "RISE UPâ¦RISE UP VIRGINIA, STAND UP YOU FREE MEN. STAND UP YOU FREE MEN. WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE THEMâ¦WE'RE GONNA DRIVE THEM TO WASHINGTON! STAND UP, VIRGINIA."That was the moment that James knew that he has to be in position. He quickly rode between the 2nd and 27th Virginia Regiments, as he pulled out his saber and look ahead to line of Yankee Infantry that we getting closer and closer , with the drum beats getting louder and louder. Like a Parade, the Yankees were showing no signs of fear.Then came Colonel Jackson's loud voice saying, "1ST BRIGADEâ¦RESERVE YOUR FIREâ¦TILL THEY COME WITHIN 50 YARDSâ¦THEN FIRE! AND GIVE THEM YANKEE'S THE BAYONET! AND WHEN YOU CHARGEâ¦YELL LIKE FURIES!"James turned his attention to the men of the Brigade. They just looked ahead at the line of Yankee Infantry that threatened their homes and Families. He could tell that they were not going to retreat or run in fear. They were going to send the Yankees running to Washington with so much fear that President Lincoln would have to negotiate peace with the Confederacy, if the Yankees retreat unorganized ; Leaving an open road to Washington. Where the Confederacy can march all the way to Washington in a day.If the capital of the Union was in Confederate hands, then Yankee morale and recruitment would mortally decrease. Especially if a few European Powers see that the Confederacy can win the war, they would recognize the Confederate States and join in against the Union. So James knew that if Confederacy wins the Battle today, then the Confederacy's independence is won.He stopped thinking as he the Yankee's are in range of the 2nd and 27th Regiments, where he remembered his job to lead the two Regiments right before a charge or when ordered to."2nd and 27th Regiments take aim." He ordered loudly.The two regiments quickly put their muskets to their shoulders as they took aim. While James saw that Yankee's were doing the same a few seconds too late and decided to use this to his advantage."FIRE.", he yelled.Not a second later, bodies of Yankee Infantry that came from all the way in Minnesota ( as James can see from the Regiment's State Flag; which showed the name of the Regiment: 1st Minnesota ) began to fall to the ground and never to show movement of life.At the same time, Yankee's were trying to return fire; but with so much bullets flying towards them and the brigades Howitzers firing at them with solid steel balls at a fast speed; it would be a small amount of them returning fire.He then heard Colonel Jackson's yell of "CHARGE BAYONET" to the Brigade.Once it was heard the men did as Colonel Jackson had ordered, they yelled so loud while they charge down the hill that James thought that it could be heard at President Lincoln's Office. The men ran so fast that the Yankee's began running back to the Artillery positions with sudden fear.James followed behind the Brigade (as he remembered the promise he made to his father) with his saber pointing straight at the Yankees."Press on, Press on." he yelled.James could see men in blue uniforms fall to the grass, as the Brigade kept on advancing. the Union Artillery were still firing, desperate to turn back the brigade; but it all was in vain as the brigade attacked the Artillery in close combat. James had to give the Yankee's credit as they fought hard to push the brigade back, but soon they surrendered as they were surrounded as the rest of Yankee's ran in fear.The battle was over, the South is victorious.James smiled and in his mind he the War will end today, if the army marched to Washington right now. But he could tell that the men need a little rest for a little bit. Then the March to Washington would begin, he was sure of it. General Beauregard knows that this is a perfect opportunity to end the war and would take advantage to it. But the order would never come.Sorry, it took so long. I really have been busy, but I also been having a really long writers block of how to make the chapter longer as I hoped to put some more stuff into the chapter. So I decided to go with this for now. I have also decided to do with about 5 or 7 more chapters until James is sent to his original time line. Soon probably in Thanksgiving the next chapter will come ( i hope that it is better than this one), as big things changed after Manassas, and James Lee will possibly change the fate of the Confederacy.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter/Gods and Generals.March 12th, 1862Near the capital of the state of Kentucky over the river that touches the city, there was a battle going on that would determine which side the state will be in. either Kentucky will stay in the Union or leave and joined Confederate States. Many citizens were hoping for the Confederates to win the battle, so that they can become proud Citizen's of the Confederate States of America; but only time will tell as the sound of gunfire can be heard from all the way from Versailles.While at this ensuing battle, on a hilltop looking over the battle , James Lee (who was wearing an all gray uniform and Kepi) watched as regiments of gray were fighting regiments of blue that were beginning to break as they were being riddled by Southern bullets and cannonballs. James even saw a regiment of blue retreating of blue dropping the Stars  Stripes that it once held. Laying on the ground was massive amounts of bodies of blue and gray. James looked away, as he felt sick at his stomach for knowing the horrors of war and the pain it brings for fighting against people of the blue that he would call his fellow countrymen. Now he is faced with the reality of fighting against them to achieve victory for his home state of Virginia and the Confederate States of America.He knew that in order to protect Virginia now, he must ensure that the state of Kentucky is a state of the Confederacy. The only problem now was that the Union has reformed in the high ground now and which also is blocking his way to Frankfort and the general in charge of the weaken Army of the Ohio will not simply retreat and let James liberate Kentucky from Federal hands. Not when the Yankee press was heavily criticizing the defeats that the Union had in the past; which was what forced the newly promoted Gen. Ambrose Burnside of the Union Army of the Ohio to attack James's Confederate Army of the Mississippi the day before.James didn't know much Burnside, only that he was once at the Battle of Manassas and served during the Mexican-American War, he could tell that Burnside was a little arrogant, when yesterday Burnside attacked him believing that his army wasn't fully concentrated at the small town of Versailles while coming from the Troy Pike; instead it was quite the opposite as Jams was concentrated outside of Versailles to the North-East. James had Burnside exactly where he wanted him and at his own terms. To say the least, Burnside has most likely lost about 6,500 men that were killed, missing, or wounded of his 42,000 troops; James only lost 2,500 men of his 70,000 men in just the first day of the battle.Now on the second day, James decided push Burnside back as James only lost a little bit of ground on the first day; but not enough to force James to retreat. James ordered the attack at first light ,taking Burnside off guard as his men were still sleeping and recovering from the first day; but some managed to form up ranks and tried to stop the Confederate advance. While that made James smile a little knowing that he was increasing his chances of Liberating the great state of Kentucky from Federal hands. But as he knew that this battle will not be a victory unless he can force Burnside to Surrender and he already had that being take care of."General Lee?" James heard a voice call out in a Louisianan accent. James turned to where the voice was, and saw that it was Gen. Beauregard.James saluted Beauregard, as he did as well. Gen. Beauregard was dressed in a uniform just like James is wearing; he had along thick brown mustache, brown eyes, and brown hair that were curly at the sides."Sir, the Yankees are broken and are running towards the ridge straight ahead. They are running like chickens with their heads cut off.", Gen. Beauregard informed with a grin.James nodded and said," very well, any news on General Tonks? Has he managed to reach the Yankees rear end?""No sir, but I will find him and have him inform you." Gen. Beauregard replied.James nodded as he watched Gen. Beauregard run to his horse and ride off to find General Tonks. James sighed, as he remembered when he was given the promotion of Maj. Gen. and Commander of the Army of Mississippi. It was a few days after the Battle of Manassas; the Confederate Senate had called for him to be in Richmond. James was surprised as he was curious of why the Confederate Senate wanted to see him; his answer came when he was at the capitol of the Confederacy (which is also where the Virginian legislature would usually be). He was sat down next to his father at the conference room of the Confederate Congress.As the Confederate President Pro tempore of the Senate, Robert M. T. Hunter, stand up and said," Members of this Congressional Senate, I have called upon you by the President of the Confederate States of America to address the results of the selection for who shall be in charge of the future formation of the Army of Mississippi that you have voted for or against based on his qualifications and recommendations by Generals Robert E Lee and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. Let us hope that this man that you have voted for will defend the Confederacy and its people; and also help achieve our southern rights."The entire Senate along with James's father clapped at Hunter's speech. While James wished that man (who would be in charge of the new Army) luck, but he was still wondering why the Confederate Senate wanted to see him. Maybe they just invite him, because he is Robert E Lee's son. That was probably most likely. Just as he was about to ask his father if it was true, Hunter began to speak again."As such I am proud to announce that based on the voting by the Confederate Senate that Harry James Lee, son of Robert E Lee and grandson of Light-Horse Harry Lee, is now to be promoted to Maj. Gen. and Cmdr. of the Army of Mississippi."The entire Senate and James's father clapped again, as James went into shock. Him? A General? This can't be! He was too young and inexperienced for that kind of position, but he knew he must accept this position for everyone in Virginia and the whole Confederacy was dependent on his actions. He would fight to the very end to make sure that he doesn't make the Confederate Senate regret the decision.Every senator was staring at him like as if they were expecting him to say something."Don't just sit there, stand up and say something?" His father whispered to him.James nodded as he took a deep breath and slowly standup to look at everyone in the room. His mouth does not want to open at first for his nerves were kicking into him. He gained strength and talk to the Confederate Senate, as he slowly stood up."Thank you, Mr. Hunter and the great Senators of this Confederacy for making this choice; of which I would have wished you had chosen someone more experience and older than myself. However, I will accept the choice you have made and defend the Confederacy until my last breath; but I feel I must address some issues that worry me and I feel that must be bought to your attention. The first thing I would address is the fact that in order for us to win the war against the Yankees, the Armies of this Confederacy need more men being held by the governors that are too concerned for their state than the whole Confederacy. In order for the armies of Confederacy to win against the Union, we must have armies larger than our enemies.And also for us to achieve victory, we must have an industry that can match the Union's; and finally we must prove to the European nations that we are not fighting to preserve the institution of slavery, only to fight for our Southern independence. If we do not prove to the world that we are only fighting for our liberty against a Tyranny, then if we are defeated; we will be known as a nation that was fighting for the preservation of Slavery."The room could not have gone any louder with the sound of clapping and cheering, while nobody noticed the Golden twinkle in James's emerald green eyes.James was surprise by the effect his speech made, which was heard by every Confederate citizen by newspapers. Industries (although not as much as the Yankee's) were popping up that was worked by women and children that joined willingly. The Confederate Congress even made a law that demanded for slave-owners to give at least half of their male slaves to the Confederate Army, if they had more than one. Though compensation would be given for a Three-fifths of their value. That may James happy a little, because by the end of the war the slaves would be free and be made equal Confederate citizens.After he was made General of the Army of Mississippi, he quickly began to form the structure of the Army. He built four Corps and a Scout Brigade that each had at least three divisions. He then chooses who he wanted in charge of each Corp and the Scout Brigade. Gen. Beauregard was in charge of the 1st Corps, Albert Johnston of the 2nd Corps, and Braxton Bragg of 3rd Corps, and Jacob Tonks of the 4th Corps, and Nathaniel Forrest of the Scout Division. The Scout Division does exactly what its name is, but also still does its role as a Cavalry unit. It basically comprised the Army's Cavalry units.Though James did feel a little lonely, as he was the only Virginia in the whole Army, as the Army was comprised of men mostly from states like Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi. He thought about asking his father, if he can transfer a Virginian Division in exchange for Kentuckian Division a few months after the battle. He still couldn't believe that his father recommended him for this position, after the conference he asked his father why he recommended him. His father replied that it would not only be safer for him, but also because he knew that James can win the war correctly.James proved him right, after a few months of form and the Army of Mississippi. He managed to defeat Union Gen. Ulysses S Grant at the Battle of Fort Henry, where he managed to take General Grant by his rear end as he was trying to capture the Fort. After losing about more than 14,000 men (along with General Don Buell being captured), he was forced to retreat back in Kentucky and Loses his position as General of the Army of Tennessee and be replaced by Gen. Ambrose Burnside from the Union Army of the Potomac. President Lincoln would then order for the Army of Tennessee to merge with the Army of the Ohio, where Gen. Burnside would still be in charge.James knew that President Lincoln now sees how much of a problem James can be, as the merge was made a few days after James decided to march into Kentucky (which was also about a few days after the Battle of Fort Henry) and head straight for Frankfort; forcing Gen. Burnside to follow him and tried to get after have him and ahead. To which he did, only because James and let him. He knew if he made Gen. Burnside a little cocky, then he might be able to win the coming battle.On March 10, James decided to have his Army concentrated at the small town of Versailles and entrench at the hilltops surrounding the town. James even had units marching ahead of Versailles, to convince Burnside that he was still having is on the march to Frankfort. This would have Burnside attacked James, next day. In that decision, Burnside would probably regret it till his dying day.The next day, James attacked Burnside; he had managed to force Burnside to pull in his reserves that was protecting his rear. It will become a grave mistake that he will never make up. The whole point of James attacking the next was to have General Tonks have his 2nd Corps (a.k.a. The African Corps) march around and surround Burnside at his rear end. The only thing is the plan won't work, unless General Tonks completes his orders. While the battle ensues, he had General Forrest and his Scout Brigade completes a special mission that James has set up for them."General Lee?" Said a familiar voice.James turned around and smiled as he saw who it was."General Tonks, have you completed the task I have set for you?" James asked."Yes sir, we have control of the Yankees rear ends." General Tonks replied, proudly.Jacob Tonks had a brown mustache, brown eyes, brown hair, a square bone chin, and was about 25 years old. He was born in the great state of South Carolina (who was the first state to secede from the Union) and a relative of the great Southern philosopher: Mary Chestnut. When the firing of Fort Sumter begun, Jacob Tonks fired one of the first shots of the war. James had become quite fond of General Tonks for volunteering for the command of the 25,000 man African Corps. James had to choose Tonks, because he was the only one who volunteered for the position.Tonks managed to prove the worth of his salt at the Battle of Fort Henry; where he led his African Corps to attack Gen. Grant's Calvary units that were trying to change the course of the battle and beaten them back successfully. For that James sent a recommendation to the Confederate Congress for a Southern Cross medal to be given to General Tonks."Good, have your men entrenched in case the Yankees try to attack tomorrow morning." James ordered, with a grin.Jacob Tonks nodded and saluting as he ran back to his horse to complete the order that he was given. James watched as the sun go down as the sound of warfare became silent and the bodies of the dead disappeared in the abyss of darkness.Washington, D.C.In the telegraph office of the War Department building, Abraham Lincoln was having a nervous breakdown. He just heard from Gen. Burnside of the Army of the Ohio that Confederate General Harry James Lee of the Army of Mississippi; has just beaten Burnside back took all, but one of the high ground decisions. He knew if Burnside retreats from the battle, then Kentucky will leave the Union for the rebelling Southern slave states; but if James Lee was forced to retreat, then not only would the union have possibility to win the war, but to also free the slaves held in the Southern States.But right now, it does not look like that would happen as James Lee was winning the battle, he turned to his Secretary of War and asked," what should I do, Stanton? If Burnside retreats, then Kentucky falls to the Confederates."Stanton was an old man that had a long white beard, said," Mr. President, from the message that Burnside has sent it looks like he is still good to fight, and James Lee has not surrounded him. So I say we attacked James Lee at his flanks it is no doubt that James's men are tired from today's actions. Tomorrow, Burnside will attack and force James back to Tennessee."Abraham nodded and agreed to the plan and said," very well, have a message sent as soon as possible."Stanton nodded as he left to have the message sent, if only they knew that they weren't given the full situation and that the message was sent from Burnside, only from the very enemy that they wished to be defeated.At the Confederate camps of the battle, James listen to the message that was to be sent to Burnside; the thing was that James would be delivering the message. But a few little changes would be made to the message, before the message was to be sent to Burnside; Gen. Forrest and his Scout Brigade managed to cut off all of Burnside's communication lines, and set up a 'special line' that connects between him and Burnside. James smiled as he listened to the message.Gen. BurnsideYou're ordered by the president to attack James Lee's flanks with your whole army in order to have James Lee's tired men retreat back to Mississippi or surrendered. This move must be made tomorrow at first light.Signed,Secretary of War: StantonJames grinned as he knew that he managed to fool Lincoln into thinking that Burnside is still good to fight, but in reality almost all of his divisions are having low morale and possible starvation due to being surrounded. The reason James did this was because once the papers in the north hear about Burnside's surrender and how James fool both him and Lincoln. When Happens the people in the north will have little trust in the government in believing that they were complement enough to end the war in victory. Now James plans to have Burnside do him a favor.Meanwhile at the union camps, Gen. Ambrose Burnside Union Army of the Ohio was drowning his fears in Alcohol of the Rebel Forces that had surrounded him, he knew that if he doesn't come up with a way to escape now then the rebel forces will destroy his army as he got the message from Washington that reinforcements will arrive to support James and. Burnside felt like an idiot for having not realizing that Lee's intentions of surrounding them and now it look like that the Confederates are winning the battle in that there was no hope for victory."Sir?" He heard.He turned and saw one of his telegraph operators and asked with a sad voice," what is it?""A message from Washington." The operator replied, handing Burnside a piece of paper.The operator saluting and Burnside dismissed him as he led the message from 'Washington'.Gen. BurnsideYou're ordered by the president to attack James Lee's part of the Army that has just attacked you. It is believed that the reinforcements that will come to support James Lee will support the part that is surrounding your rear. This order must be carried out by the afternoon.Signed,Secretary of War: StantonBurnside sighed in relief. Tomorrow afternoon, he would have Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman attack James Lee's center. He knew that tomorrow will determine the fate of this Army.The next day on March 13th, when first day light came Burnside began to order for all Artillery to be sent to the South- East as soon as possible and for General Sherman to see him as soon as possible. Time was of the essence, for the existence of this army depends on it. Every second is precious, This Army has to flee to Ohio or else This Army falls and the Union will be endangered by the possibility that James could march into Ohio and into Pennsylvania unopposed. He can't let that happen, if he does than his reputation will be damaged more than it is right now.He watched as he saw that Jamie (a name that he would hear the men call James as a joke) Lee's men were in their tents asleep, resting from yesterday's attack. Burnside could smile a little, feeling that maybe that there is a chance to escape to Ohio and protect the Union. But this attack has to be done correctly in order for the Army to escape."You wanted to see me, Sir?" spoke a familiar deep voice behind him.Burnside replied knowing who it was, "Yes, General Sherman. I want your men to be in the forest behind the Artillery. The artillery will be bombarding James's Center in order to destroy the defenses there. A Feu d' enfer as Napoleon would call it. When the Guns destroy the defenses there, your division will march out of the forest and continue towards the center. Then Jaime Lee's center will break and rout. Giving this Army a chance to flee to Ohio."Sherman looked at the Rebel occupied hilltop that Burnside is referring to and said in shock, "General Burnside, what you are asking is impossible. The Rebels are without a doubt wanting us to attack; I bet that they are just waiting with just 2 divisions and loads of cannons. There is no way than any 10,000 men ever made can take that hill in such open ground in a little more than a mile; the cannons on that hill will destroy about at least half of my division and then the infantry that's behind the Stonewall will cause the men to rout. What's more, as the charge begins; how do we coordinate? How do we lead the attack? ""Nonsense, General. Take a look with these Binoculars and you'll see that it is not as hard as you think." The Commanding General replied.Sherman stroking his brown beard agreed to look through the binoculars and was surprised to see that there were about 15 Twelve Pound Napoleon Howitzers and only a few brigades of infantry to defend the hill. What was even better was that there weren't any reinforcements nearby."That maybe General, but James could be tricking. Remember what he did when Grant was in charge during the Battle of Fort Henry" Sherman informed."That maybe, But Grant didn't think about those rebels that were stationed in Corinth that lead to his defeat and me replacing him." Burnside replied."But Generalâ¦""General Sherman go and have your division form up in the forest. That's an Order."Sherman nodded and gave a salute as he left to form his division in the forest.An Hour later, James watched as he saw the Yankees unlimber the cannons preparing for the massive bombardment that was to come at the afternoon."This is it, today is the day that Kentucky is liberated from federal hands. It now lies upon the actions made today." James thought as he watched as the Clarks division waited below the slope of the hill until the Yankees began to March. While many of the cannons were covered in leaves and branches to look like bushes."General, it's almost noon. It's best that you go behind the hill, unless you wish to get hit by cannon balls." suggested P.G.T. Beauregard in his Louisianan accent.James laughed and said, "Your right. Of course, General. Just curious, what will you do when the war is over; after the Confederacy gains its independence?"The Cajun General smile, saying, "Well, I really haven't decided; but I think I will go back to Louisiana and live a wonderful and peaceful life. And you, General Lee?""Well, when I become of the required age. I plan to become President of the Confederacy and build this country into a better nation.""Well, I know who to put my vote in for that coming election. I believe you would be a great President as you are a great General.""Thanks.""Do you think that Burnside, will take the bait?""He has to or else his Army will either be destroyed by us or starve to death since we captured most of the food supplies they had, yesterday.""Yes, I suppose that isâ¦"Then came the sound of cannon at a far distance."GET DOWN.", Beauregard yelled as jumped to the ground.James did, as soon as he did came a loud explosion not far from James, probably about 20 feet. The sound was ear deafening at so close. Then came even more sounds of cannon firing at the same, the bombardment was massive, James had to assume that Burnside was probably using about 50 Cannons or more in the bombard."General, we must take refuge at the slope of the hill." Beauregard yelled."Yes, your right, but firstâ¦ EXSPOSED ARTIELLRY BEGIN COUNTER-BATTERY FIRE!", James ordered.The Order was passes around to each exposed Napoleon, until they began to return fire. Sending 9 pound projectiles at almost a mile across the open field. James watched with his binoculars, as some of the projectiles managed to hit their target, destroying a few Yankee cannons and even killing a few Yankees."General, you must get to safety.", informed Beauregard."Very well, after each few minutes have one or two of our cannons cease-fire. I want Burnside to think that he is winning.", James replied."Yes, sir."James nodded as he went to slope with Clarks division to safety as the exchange of fire continued at both sides of the battlefield. The sound of his cannons began to go faint as the minutes that felt like hours passed. James began to pray for victory from God, as the sound of his cannons finally became silent. James checked his watch and saw the time is 12:45. James knew that sooner or later Burnside will order the charge. He knew that Burnside has to order the charge or his Army will be destroyed.At the other side of the battlefield, among the Union lines, Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman watched as the Cannons began to send volleys at the Rebels. Probably enough to scare Jamie Lee away back to Tennessee."Maybe, this Charge will work after all.", Sherman thought.He listen as the fire continued for the next 30 minutes. Then the cannons suddenly became silent at both sides. Sherman was confused, until he heard a horse near him and turned around as he saw that it was Burnside in a white horse. He looked at the arrogant general at eyes."You may begin the Charge, General.", Burnside ordered.Sherman nodded as he gave a salute and ordered his brigade commanders to form the Division in double line. Sherman decided that he was going to join his boys in the charge. If his division was going to be destroyed, then he was going to be destroyed along with it. Though Burnside doubted that this charge will fail. He already had a letter wrote for his family back at Ohio incase he died in this charge. He could feel his breakdown coming back, because of this charge. He felt his nerves tingling in fear for thought of this charge failing and the reputation he will earn if he fails. Sweat was coming from ever pour from his body, he shouldn't feel nervous for he knew that this charge will succeed"General, the men are ready." He heard one of his adjutants informed."Very well, then.", he said as he turned to his division.All of the 10,000 men were waiting for him to give the order to advance.He pulled out his sword and raised it up in the air; and said "Men, today is the day; where we managed to break these rebels. They think that they have caught us at our weak spot and our knees; but instead today they will be proven wrong. We will escape this rebel blockade and continue to protect the union. Men, forwardâ¦MARCH."The union boys began to march as the drummers began to play the Union Battle Cry of Freedom; while the whole division sang to the song. Some of them were even cheering as they passed the cannons ; who also cheered to them. They marched across the opened field with Sherman leading them to 'Victory'.James watched and listen as the Union boys sang as well as marched toward their target, while standing on the crest of the Hill. He couldn't help but admit that they have the courage to march across this field. Then he heard his boys play a song as well, to complete against the song that the Yankee's were playing. James recognized the song, it was written from a Northern (surprisingly). Dixie to the Confederacy is like the National Anthem in a way, but only the popular one. There are songs of the Confederacy that are anthems like "The Bonnie Blue Flag" and "God Save the South", But James could say that "Dixie" is probably the best song that represents the Confederacy best."Sir, shall the Artillery begin firing at the Yankee's.", asked one of the Artillery Commander's."Yes, you may. Have the hidden Artillery uncover and fire as well.", James answered.The Artillery Commander saluted as he went around passing the order.James closed his eyes as he watched as the Yankee's were being slaughtered by all of the 100 or so Confederate Cannons and Howitzers. Bodies of blue were falling like rain, the sight was unbearable to watch. He saw that even some of the Union Cannons were being destroyed as some of his Artillery were turning their attention to the Yankee Cannons."I guess what Dad says is true. It is well that War is so terrible, for we should grow too fond of It.", James thought, as the Artillery continued destroying the advancing Yankee's.The sound of Artillery and smell of burnt gunpowder was distracting James as he felt sick to his stomach. He knew he should have eaten lunch before the battle, now he might regret from seeing those poor Yankee's being killed. This was different from Fort Henry, most of the men that Grant lost was only captured, not killed."General, Are you ok? ", he heard.James slowly turned around as he saw it Colonel Strahl of commander of the 3rd brigade of Clarks Division. He had a black beard and hair, with brown eyes, and the same type of uniform that James is wearing, the only thing different is his rank insignia (which is 3 gold stars)."Yes, Strahl. Just can't stand seeing the blood being spilt on this field.", James replied with a small smile."I understand. Sir, shall I move my brigade up to support Cheatham's Division?", Strahl asked."Yes, you may. You shall support Cheatham's right flank and have someone inform Colonel Russell to send 2 regiments to support Cheatham's left flank.", James ordered.Strahl nodded as he quickly went to complete his orders.James continued to watch as the advancing Yankee's that were being destroyed as the trail of dead bodies were left behind them. They continue sing songs like the "Battle Hymn of the Republic", "John Brown's Body", and many others as they closer and closer towards the center, the charge has already lasted for almost an hour and they have already lost almost a quarter of their division to the Confederate Artillery. He noticed the man that was leading the Yankee's. He had his sword pointed forward and was yelling orders.James was impressed with him, here is a man that is determined to fulfill his duty, even if that means risking his life. He watched as the man showed no fear for death, as cannon balls were exploding all around him. He assumed that this man must be in charge of the 4 brigade Division that was marching like Napoleon's Old Guard at Waterloo as they were about to attack Wellington's center, before Napoleon was flanked by the Prussians.James now realized that the Yankee's were range of the Confederate Infantry and before the Yankee's had the chance to fire, the Confederates fired first as almost a whole role of Yankee's fell to the ground; many not showing any other movement. The screams of pain from those poor Yankee boys filled James ear as they were hit by Southern Bullets; he even saw a flag of Stars and Stripes that was almost ripped apart by Bullets and Cannon. He admired the Honor, Courage, and Commitment that the Yankee's were showing as they kept advancing ; while returning fire.Then he saw the Yankee's heading to his center running at a quick pace, James realized that they were trying to press him with the whole Division at one spot. He quickly got on Traveler and rode to Clarks Division. He rode to there so fast that it didn't take long to reach the Division."Get Ready boys, the Yankee's are coming to try to rout us at one spot; but Today, they will be prove them wrong and I know that you will do your duty.", James informed Clarks Division.The men cheered while chanting, "General Lee!", over and over again."Men, Forward.", James yelled.Slowly the Division began to advance to the center behind Cheatham's Division, waiting for the Yankee to try to break them. To which in their minds that will never happen. They could see the Yankee's running to the 2nd and 15th Tennessee regiments, while be riddled by Bullets and Cannon Balls from Cheatham's Division. James order for the 2nd and 15th to fall back behind the division, so that they won't be mowed down by the quickly advancing Yankee's. James watched as the Enemy stepped over the Stonewall, he then saw one of the Cannons fire at the masses of Yankee's. James Looked away as the cannon went off and the ear piercing screams came. Then he heard Clarks Division open fie upon them.He looked backed at the Enemy and saw that they were tired as they were being attack by Clarks Division, who were charging them back and fought them with their bayonets and hands. James knew that the Yankee's were being overwhelmed by them. He watched as the sight of men in blue slowly fall to the ground in a matter of minutes. James saw the man that was leading the whole division on the ground near the Stonewall with two bullet wounds to the chest, he was groaning in paining. James knew that he must save him, he did so as he watched as what remained of the Yankee Division had either had been killed, routed, or surrender out of exhaustion.James slowly rode up to the man, he looked at the man's pale face and his hands covered in his own blood.The man said slowly to James in pain, "Wellâ¦Never thoughtâ¦ that I wouldâ¦ be seeing Jamie Leeâ¦In Person, face to face."James got off of Traveler and walked up to the Man and asked, "What is your name?""Williamâ¦William Tecumseh Shermanâ¦ Brigadier General of the 5th Division of the Army of the Ohio.", the Dying man answered."That was your division that just fell I assume?", James asked.Sherman nodded slowly with tears in his eyes as he replied, "Yes, those were my boys. Soon, I will be joining them.""No, you won't. I'm going to take you to the field Hospital. You there, help me bring this man to the Surgeon. ", James order to a soldier nearby.The soldier nodded as he helped James carry Sherman to the Field Hospital."It's no good, Lee. I have already lost enough blood. Soon, I will die.""Not on my watch.", James said with a voice of determination as he and the Soldier carried Sherman to an Ambulance where he would quickly be taken to the field hospital.Meanwhile at the other side of the field, General Burnside was now having a breakdown. As he saw Sherman's division destroyed. He knew to expected high causalities from the battle report. He was worried about Burnside, whether he lived or not through the charge. He couldn't believe how James had all of that Artillery and destroy Sherman's Division. Lee's Artillery even managed to destroy s little more than a quarter of his Artillery, while the rest had either run of ammo, or able bodied men to man them.What worried him that most was how James knew that he was going to order the charge; because there is no way Jamie Lee would have all of his Artillery at that one hill without knowing about the charge. He couldn't figure out, maybe Jamie Lee managed to listen to his message from Washington; but it didn't matter now. The Battle is lost, this Army is lost. Now, he will be forced to surrender to James soon or else the Army will be destroyed.He slowly rode to his command tent to retrieve a white sheet.Time passed as he listened to the screams of the wounded as some had to have their limbs cut off, because of their wounds. James tried to cover his ears, as he waited to hear about Sherman. Many of his man had wondered he cared for Sherman.To which James replied saying, "the Bible says to Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."He waited patiently to hear about Sherman. Then came out the Surgeon from the Hospital tent with a cigar in his mouth ."Well?", James asked."I have done everything I can do, General. All I can say is might or he might not. All we can do is wait and see. He's asleep, I had to drug him to make sure that he doesn't feel any pain.", the Surgeon replied.James nodded and left to go to his command tent, until he heard one of the soldiers inform him that someone was waiting to see him in his tent. James thanked the soldier and quickly went to his tent. He saw who it and wasn't surprised. There sitting on a chair was General Burnside of the Army of the Ohio. James knew exactly why he is here."Hello, General Burnside. I can say that I'm not surprised to see you, now.", James announced."I figured as much. When I went through you lines, they just only told me to follow them to here. To which I was surprised. But before I get to why I'm here, I must asked if Sherman is in your hands? Because I heard that he was captured after the charge.", Burnside uttered."Yes, he's in the field Hospital. He suffered two shots to the chest, the Surgeon says he might live. He's asleep right now, so you can't talk to him yet.", James replied."Very well, then on to what matters. Since you have managed to surround my army, and the charge today was a failure. General Lee, I have come to offer the surrender of the forces under my command.""Sir, your men have fought honorably. I will ensure that you and your men will be given honorable terms.""Very well, I must return to Washington and informed of the developments, hereâ¦.""Don't worry about, that I will take care of that."Burnside raised an eyebrow, "What do you mean?""All of your communication lines have recently been cut and I have the only line to Washington.", James replied, although he didn't want to tell Burnside that the order he received to do the charge wasn't from Washington. James already felt bad of sending it after seeing Sherman's Charge this afternoon."I assume that it was Forrest's Cavalry division that cut them?", Burnside questioned.James nodded."Very well, I will inform my men of the development that has been. I assume that you will be sending message to the president of my surrender?"James nodded again.Burnside said nothing else, he just left the tent and got back on his horse; then rode back to his lines. While James left the tent to the Communications Tent to send a message to the President of the United States and maybe even to the New York Times.Meanwhile in the Washington War Department Telegraph office, President Lincoln was feeling like he was having a heart attack as he read the message sent from Versailles:Mr. PresidentI thought that I should bring to your attention that General Burnside of the Army of the Ohio has surrender to my Army after being surround yesterday by my forces. His Charge this morning has resulted him and his Army to surrender. Unfortunately, he won't be able to send the message himself; because all of his communication lines to you have been cut by my forces. Hope you are having a nice day. Sincerely, C.S.A. General of the Army of Mississippi,Harry James Lee"My God, what will my country say?", he orated in shock.He would find out when the New York Times received a message from a certain Confederate General telling them about Burnsides' surrender to James Lee. The next day, the following was added on the front page.Burnside surrenders to H.J. Lee at Versailles, KentuckySorry, it took so long to make this chapter. A few weeks ago my computer's mother board died out on me and so I had to rewrite the entire chapter on my new computer. Again, I apologize. Also I would to say that any questions of the story on the reviews will be answered starting on the next chapter. Last thing I would like to post a challenge, this is what is required:Harry must be either raised by a famous person or reincarnated of a famous person.If Harry is raised by a famous, he must return to his timeline during or before any of the school yearsHarry must somehow change the Muggle World, Magical World, or both.

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER AND GODS AND GENERALSJune 18, 1862Frankfort, Kentucky, C.S.A.It has been about three months, since the famous Battle of Versailles and the liberation of Kentucky from the Yankee's and now things couldn't get any better for the Confederate States as more men were recruited for the southern cause, more supplies were able to be sent to supply other confederate Armies. The industry of the confederacy had dramatically improved, thanks to Kentucky joining the Confederacy. Not only just that, but also the Nations of U.K. and France recognize and joined the Confederate States in its war of independence.This cause Lincoln to pull some units from the Union Army of the Potomac and New Orleans, along with other parts that the Union are occupying that belong to the Confederacy. Lincoln even had to make another Enlistment and Draft Act by Executive order to which the Yankee Congress fully supported. James could say that this will cause a major draft riot in the union as people were being forced to serve for their country, and even the people who just came to the Union States for a better life and away from the old life that they had just left. Now they were forced to fight against their will and just wanted to have a new life were now at risk of being killed in war.It was no doubt in James's mind that Lincoln lost any chance of being re-elected for the 1864 Presidential Elections. However, this is what James wanted. He knew that in case this war suddenly turns into a stalemate by 1864, then when a new Union President is elected. That president will give what the people wants and that is peace. Although James hoped to cause enough trouble on President Lincoln to force him to negotiate peace with the Confederacy.That is when James realized that he has an opportunity as the Union Forces face a multiple front war that is not mainly in the south and east, but also north and west. Right now, The Union are trying hard to beat back the British at the New England States and the Great Lake States. However that didn't stop the Brits from capturing the city of Detroit, and the State of Maine. Not only that, The Union Blockade of the South was crumbled by the more Powerful British and French got even worse for the Union as General Polk managed to defeat FrÃ©mont not far from the state capital city of Missouri; which would later have the State of Missouri leave the Union and join the Confederacy. In James's mind, there is no way the south could lose this war now. Though James wasn't going to get over confident. Burnside was over confident and look where that got him at. He knew that in order to bring Lincoln to the Table of Peace, he must cause enough stress on Lincoln to want peace.James read as he knew this report that his radio operators intercept that is for Mr. Lincoln saying that the Union forces that were fighting to defend the City of San Diego for the past 4 days have surrendered to the attacking Confederate, French, and Mexican Imperial forces. James smiled as he knew that San Diego and the Southern portion of California are now in Confederate hands. It even meant that fort that was near San Francisco that is filled with Gold is also in the hands of the Confederates. James could image that look on President Lincoln's face for when he hears the news, especially when the Union papers hear about this.James then heard a knock and said for whoever it is at the door to come in. he turned around looking away from the map of the state of Kentucky along with parts of the surrounding states and realized who it is. It none other than the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis. Jefferson was a man of over 50 years old; he had marks showed stress of being president of a nation trying to achieve its independence, he wore an expensive business suit that was made out of fine Southern Cotton."Mr. President!"James saluted.Davis saluted back as he said "General Lee, I was hoping to see you here. I was hoping for you to attend my speech that will be made at Versailles, tomorrow.""I will be honored to attend your speech, also since you're here. Mr. President, I was hoping to show you my plans on winning this war much quicker?" James asked."Very well and also General-In-Chief James Lee please call me Jefferson. Ever since Fort Henry, you have earned my respect. Although for my vice-President Stephens doesn't agree with everything with you since you managed to convince Congress to pass the Negro Enlistment Act, which I believe helped formed your African Corps, if I am correct?" Jefferson asked."Yes, that is correct, Mr. â¦ I meanâ¦ Jefferson."That was correct; James was made General-In-Chief of the Confederate Army. It was after his decisive victory at Versailles, the Confederate Congress decided as congratulations to promote him to the position. The whole position meant that his is second in command of the Confederate Army; only President Davis is the only one that overrides his orders. President Davis was more than happy to give James the position, while people like Vice-President of the Confederate States Alexander Stephens didn't agree of giving James the position; seeing him as a Traitor to the South after convincing Congress to pass the Negro Enlistment Act.Although they couldn't convince anyone after James's victories at Fort Henry and Versailles, so they decided to shut up and wait for the right moment. As speaking against him was like treason to many royal southerners that have faith in James.Though James hated the fame he was getting. All he wanted to do was to have the south be inspired to fight and see that they have to be stronger to win the war, but personally he wanted to defend the South (as well as Virginia) until the end of his life, but now he was seen as National Hero like the Napoleon of this Era. Especially when he had to do a picture with his hand in his jacket like Napoleon.That was when James understood that every Southern Mother and Child, that now has a relative in the Confederate Army was depending on James to end the war quickly so that they can be with their loved ones. He hopes that the plan he has formulated will do just that if done correctly. All he needs to ensure that this plan will work is to have Jefferson's permission for this plan to be initiated."As you can see here, Jefferson, on this map. The Union are facing multiple fronts to defend against. They have to deal with General Douglas's Army that now occupy Detroit, which is the main gateway for any of our ally's advance (in order to capture all of Michigan), and General Keppel's Army that now controls the state of Maine and threaten to advance to the New England States. While that happens Lincoln has being trying to do a mass recruitment in order to change the tide of this war. So he has fortify and increased the size of the following Armies: obviously the Army of the Potomac (since they fear what my father could do as much as they fear me)...""And I wouldn't blame them. As you did things that no average General could think of in this century. Many people believe that you are possibly Napoleon reincarnated." Jefferson said, in admiring manner.James chuckled, as he said "Jefferson, I ask that you do not compare me to Napoleon the First; because in my opinion that is jinx for when someone is claiming themselves to be like Napoleon, in the future they have their own Waterloo or Humiliating Defeat. For example: Santa Anna of Mexico claimed to be the Napoleon of the West. About a month after his victory at the Alamo, Santa Anna was ambushed at the Battle of San Jacinto and was humility captured and was forced to recognized the Republic of Texas as a Nation. So, Jefferson, I ask that you don't compare me to Napoleon; unless you're asking for me to be in decisive defeat."Jefferson nodded in understanding."Now on to the Union Armies. Now Lincoln has improved the following: Army of the Potomac, Army of the Northeast, Army of the Great Lakes, and the 2nd Army of the Ohio." James continued."The Armies of the Northeast, Great Lakes, and 2nd Ohio are the newer Armies correct?" Jefferson asked.James nodded as he said "Yes, Jefferson, that is correct. Now, as you can see on the map, the 2nd Ohio is stationed at Cincinnati, which is also my best way into Ohio and in order for me to march into Pennsylvania. However, the man in charge of that Army isn't going to make things easy for me. Plus the fact that he has at least over a 100,000 men under his command; but I plan to reduce that by a third in order to even the odds for me. For my plan to advance into Ohio. However, that cannot be done without my father putting into effect a plan I have for him.""I see, so what you are saying is you need a distraction in order for you to achieve that goal of advancing into Ohio and you need your father to make that distraction." Jefferson continued."Correct, Now I will send General Cooper of the newly formed Army of Eastern Kentucky advance into Western Virginia to support my father in his advancement into Pennsylvania, while at the same time liberate Western Virginia that the Union have stolen from our beloved Virginia.", James explained."I see. But do we know who is in charge of the 2nd Ohio?" Jefferson questioned."Yes, sir. We do. His name is Winfield Scott Hancock. Nicknamed 'Winfield the Superb' after some minor Union victories that President Lincoln claim to be decisive in the Union Peninsula campaign that McClellan lead. I sense that he knows that I am as clever as a Snake in the battlefield and will be cautious and nervous of what I can do.", James continued."Yes, the Peninsula Campaign. I still remember how I had to replace Johnson for your Father, after he allowed McClellan to get very close to Richmond. To say I had never been more nervous in my life. However from what I am understanding from your plan; this is a multi-front attack to where the Union are being forced even more to split their forces to where they weaken other fronts.""Yes, Jefferson. When my father reaches into Pennsylvania, I want him to find a place where the Union will face their own Waterloo. Then while that happens, I will force Hancock to attack me at a place of my own choosing as I have reports from our agent inside Hancock's Army that he plans to advance down to Falmouth, Kentucky and then try to head to somewhere to force me to attack him on his own terms.""I, see. But I doubt that you will attack him just like that, General-In-Chief.""No, Jefferson. I won't. I plan to be at Falmouth before Hancock. President Lincoln will demand for him to attack me, even if he doesn't get the high ground that he needs. Lincoln is desperate for a victory and will do anything to get it.""Well, General Lee. I see that you have everything plan out. But there is one thing that still concerns me, how are you sure that Lincoln won't take the bait and send part of Hancock's 2nd Ohio to McClellan back at Maryland?" Jefferson said, looking over the map that James laid out."Because, Jefferson, Lincoln knows that if he loses Washington and Maryland then he would lose all of his support in the war, the Yankee Congress will demand for peace and will threaten to impeach him if he doesn't, and people will revolt against Lincoln non-stop as they fear of the blood being brought to them that they caused.""I see. Well, General Lee, if anyone can make this plan work then it's you and your father. You have my approval of this plan and I wish you the best of luck as well as god bless you."James nodded and saluted, as Jefferson continued "Now, come on, General, we mustn't be late for me to deliver an address to our fellow Confederates.""Yes, Jefferson. Of course, lead the way." James answered as he followed the First Confederate President to the carriage that would take them to the trip to Versailles.Washington, D.C.In the War Office, a frustrated Abraham Lincoln threw his Top Hat to the ground hard enough that it got the attention of every Operator working there as he got the bad news of the surrender of San Diego to the rebelling Confederates."How could this have happened?' he yelled, "This shouldn't have happened."But the Sixteenth President knew that it did and now he was going to have to face the music, just like Versailles after trying to keep it quiet; but somehow Jamie Lee sent a message to the New York Times and other major Newspapers about Burnsides surrender.When Burnsides surrender at Versailles was heard nationwide, everyone was shocked in the U.S. and blamed Lincoln for the defeat. Especially with the fact that Lincoln was fooled by James Lee, when he sent Burnsides orders and turned out that he was sending to Lee's Army. People began then began to think that if the President could be fooled by the enemy then he was not fit to be President of the United States of America. It got even worse when England and France heard about the victory and decided to support the Confederate Rebels, while also declaring war on the U.S. This forced Lincoln to sign a 750,000 man draft by the executive order, but so far only about 285,000 men were recruited for an enlistment and draft.The only reason why he didn't get the number of men that he needs right now is because everyone believe that the war is lost and that there is no hope what so ever. Especially with the fact English occupying Detroit, Michigan and the whole state of Maine. As well as The British and French Naval ships that destroyed all the U.S. ships blockading the Confederate ports and are now blockading the Union. Preventing any transportation of supplies and Reinforcements being able to be sent to the Union Forces that are trying to hold on to New Orleans, as well as escape for the Forces stationed there as the Confederate Rebels and French forces kept attacking. Lincoln knew that it was only a matter of time before General Butler surrenders New Orleans to the enemy.However Lincoln still believed that there is always a chance and that the war is not lost yet. He believe that the only way to change the tide was to destroy Robert Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and James Lee's reformed Army of Northern Kentucky. This would increase Morale and have everyone believe that the war can be won. He knew that soon that Hancock will soon in a matter of a days will be advancing to Falmouth, Kentucky, that will no doubt force Jamie Lee attack Hancock in his own terms. While Robert Lee will obviously will advance into Pennsylvania in the matter of a month or two, so that was not a worry yet. As he knew that if Jamie's Army is destroyed, then Robert will send some units to help out James in future engagements. Making Robert Lee's Army weaker.Lincoln sighed as he went to his desk to drink in shame for he knew what storm the public will make once they heard the surrender of San Francisco. He prayed to God for the plans that he laid out will work or else the Union will forever be lost.Versailles, Kentucky, C.S.A.James sat a stand as the Confederate President Jefferson Davis gave his speech to about 100,000 Confederate citizens that were eager to listen to the speech that Jefferson began to give to which would be famously be known as the Versailles Address."My fellow Confederates, about 86 years ago, our founding fathers built the nation that we were once whole; upon the values of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Now, we are at war with the nation that they built, for the Government there have ignored those values and refuse to acknowledge the laws that our founders have wrote in order to build a more perfect Union. However, that Union is broken by a corrupt administration the North. The ideas that the founders that we honor have always been remembered and right the way it should always be. For that Democracy will always be run by, of, and for the people. Freedom shall always be free and by the grace of god it shall always be, even in the Heavenly Kingdom of the Lord Almighty."The people clapped and cheered as the band began to play Dixie. While the crowd sang with the music as James decided to join in the singing as loud as his lungs would let him. He smiled as he saw people began waving their flags of the Confederate Battle Flag; which has criss-cross bars and thirteen stars inside the bars. The inside of the bars were blue while the triangles outside of the bars were red. James couldn't help and feel that the people in the crowd believe that as if the war is already won; but James knew that not's true yet and he is going to make that it is won.He looked up at the sky and in his mind prayed "Father, you who knows all things, I ask you to end this war and have the Yankee's come for peace to the Confederacy and that after the war, an era of peace and friendship between the Union and the Confederacy to be made; even after I die. Even if it costs me my life, I will consider it an honor. Amen."He kissed the cross around his neck as he knew that the Holy Father is with him right and has heard his prayer.Sorry, again. It took me so long; I've been in writer's block. However I plan to try to make up for that before the summer ends if possible. I am now determined to continue working on this story; I hope to have another chapter soon. Please leave a comment and until next time.

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER/GODS AND GENERALS.June 25, 1862, 12:00 A.M.Falmouth, Kentucky, C.S.A.It was midnight in the small town of Falmouth, The citizens of the once peaceful town couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen later today. As yesterday a division from James Lee's Army of Northern Kentucky attack two Divisions of Hancock's 2nd Army of the Ohio that are holding the high grounds. The Union General in command of the two divisions' was John Buford, who managed to hold out against the assault of the Confederate Division lead by General Evans. Though the Union managed to beat Evans back, there was the feeling that the battle that would continue in the morning would be a Confederate victory once. Once General Lee arrived to take command of the battle with reinforcements.Though they thought that he would continue the battle in the morning. If only they knew that was not how James Lee fights as they would later hear the sounds of war in the dead of night.Outside of Falmouth, ahead of the hills behind the town. James Lee watched through his binoculars at the number of Yankee camp tents filled with sleeping Yankee's, which were unaware that they would be for a big surprise. James was still a bit angry that he had to attack at this time, for it would tire the men. He knew that he must do this in order to have a chance to destroy Hancock's Army and advance into Ohio. When he arrived about a few hours earlier, he seriously chewed out General Mark Evans for starting an engagement without his permission. James knew that if Evans Division had been destroyed it would have lead to the Union thinking that he has a weakness. He definitely didn't want to give the Union that kind of idea, especially President Lincoln.Giving the Union hope was the last thing James wanted to do, and now he was going to crush that Union Pride by attacking when they least expected. His plan was simple, Attack the Union with a full on Charge from their front and rear, along with an attack on their left flank. James couldn't help but smile knowing that the Union would be in a big surprise."General Lee," he heard.James turned around and when he saw who it was, he smiled.The man that called for him was wearing a uniform like his. He had a light blue eyes, a weird type of style of a beard, a puffy mustache, and a smile that looked like as if he was a child on Christmas."Yes, General Pickett? What is it?" James asked."Sir, my Division, and General Russel's Division are in place. We are ready to begin the charge." Pickett answered, with a salute.James saluted back and replied, "Splendid. What about Roberts and Clark's divisions?""They are at their positions, General Lee," Pickett replied with a buck toothy grin.James nodded and instructed that the charge will begin in ten minutes.General Pickett nodded and saluted as he ran back to his horse to spread the orders. James turned around looking at the lights of the Union camps, which were filled with sleeping Yankee's. He could see it now, the blue boys running in terror as they were attacked from all sides from the Confederate Army. It felt like a reality, a dream that became very real. He felt the air breath upon him, a wind of a coming victory."General Pickett is quite the chap, I would say. Would agree General Lee?" inquired a very friendly voice.James knew that voice. It was the voice of the very cheerful Colonel Arthur Fremantle of England's Coldstream Guards. He was sent over from England originally as an observer of Queen Victoria after the victory of Fort Henry. However, After Versailles, England, and France seeing this as an excellent opportunity to join the war and maybe get something out it. Fremantle was then made unofficially as an instructor to help discipline and train the Confederate Army. The men in the Army saw him as a Marquis de Lafayette because the way he taught them new moves and tactics were like the stories of Lafayette in the First War of Independence. They respected him and saw him as one of their own. Fremantle even once told him that he enjoys being a part of this army. It gives him a sense of pride more than he experienced in the British Army.He remembered Fremantle telling in a conversation while playing poker, about that he and the rest of the Confederate citizens are just transplanted Englishmen and that he wished that his country and the Confederacy will forever be allies. James nodded, as he gave a straight out bluff in the table. He shook his head as he came back to the present. Slowly, he turned around and looked at the English Colonel. He wore his tradition blood red uniform and hat with black shoes. He was slim, brown hair, brown mustache, and blue eyes, which were dancing happily.James smiled as he replied, "Pickett is a good man, and he fought with my father in the Mexican War.""Ah, yes, The Mexican War. I believe that was a war fought over the fact that Texas wanted to join the once firm and fair Union if I am correct." Fremantle uttered cheerfully."Kind of," James answered."May I speak freely, General Lee?""You May indeed. It is a free country, mostly.""Why attack Buford at night, instead of at daylight? I mean, there are surely going to be some risks in fighting in the dark. Also, it isâ¦wellâ¦how should I say...not normal in warfare." Fremantle spoke with confusing as he desperately tried the correct word that he was attempting to say.James smiled as he expected this, "Well, Colonel Fremantle, the reason, why I am attacking Buford at night, is because of the fact that he and the Yankee's are mostly asleep. So they will not be able to see this coming at all. Now, yes, there are risks. However, doesn't War always involve risks? I am risking my life to help save my home state of Virginia. Warfare is constantly changing as each one comes and goes. During a war, something new is invented to help end the war quicker. Each war is different."Fremantle nodded in understanding as he went back to his horse to find the tallest tree he could find to get a good view of the coming charge.James sighed as looked at his watch, and realized that there was still three minutes left till the attack starts. He decided what he should do next. Then it came to him, he could join General Pickett's division in the charge. So he quickly ran back to Traveler and climbed up the saddle; while moving faster than the wind, Traveler began to take to where Pickett's Division is positioned. He felt himself shack as Traveler ran faster and faster to Pickett. James had always felt himself connected to Traveler somehow in some way like he knew what was feeling and thinking. Some of the Troops in Army feel at times funny when they see him talking to Traveler like he's a human. However, James would just shrug it off as normal.Then the sight of Pickett's three brigades' came in James's view. He slowly had Traveler slow and stop right beside the shocked General Pickett and his Brigade Commanders."Nice to see you, General Pickett. I have decided to join you and your Virginians in this charge, tonight." James announced happily with a big smile.One of the Brigade Commanders (Garnet, James believed) said with shock "But General, you shouldn't be joining the men. It is too dangerous. We can't risk losing you.""Well," James replied with honesty, "I am willing to take the risk."The Commanders nodded as they knew that they could not stop the Commanding General. James looked at his watch again and noticed the time. 12:10, it was time for the attack. He looked at General Pickett."You may begin the Attack, now."General Pickett nodded as he silently began giving orders. James could see that most of the men around him were ready to the coming fight. He could their faces. The faces of knowing that a victory is coming. These are willing to achieve success at day or night, winter or summer. He listened as each one of the men gave an intense prayer in case if they do not survive the coming engagement. Then came the silent order to advance that from Pickett.It was at first a slow march, just to make sure that they division still has the element of surprise before they make the charge. He slowly followed them at the rear while pulling out the flag that his father had sent him and attached it to a large pole. It was the state flag of Virginia with Virtue standing over the death of Tyranny in a circular seal that the Virginian Motto in Latin; which was "Death to Tyrants". Below the seal was the Lee Family seal with the motto in Latin, "Not Unmindful of the Future". With the Flag, he felt like a proud Virginian.Slowly, inch by inch, he could see Union camps getting closer and closer. It was there, right in the open for an attack from all sides. From Pickett at the Center of the 4 Union Brigades or 2 Divisions, Roberts of the 1st Cavalry Division (part of Forrest's New Cavalry Corps) attack at the rear of the Union, Clarks Division at the Union's East Flank, and Russel's Division at the Union's West Flank. The Plan was basically to choke the Union Divisions to Surrender. He knows this plan will work, it has to; or else this will change his plans.He noticed that they were not far from the Union Camps. He could see Russel's Division about to attack the Union's West Flank. He could tell that they were ready for the fight from the distance. Then he heard the Rebel Yell from Pickett's Division as they made a fast charge towards the Yankee's, waking up the shocked the Blue Boys as they could not believe what was happening. Many of them were yelling to the others to run, few of them were actually giving orders to grab their muskets and form up. However, they were not very successful. James watched as the Virginians began firing into the mass of running Yankee's, this lead to bodies of blue falling to the ground like rain. Then came the Artillery fire to the Union Camps, which destroyed a tent or two. There was a small formation of Yankee's that lined up to try and pushed the attacking Confederates. However, it only took one volley from Armistead's Brigade to take out most of them and have the rest of their running like dogs.He turned to his left and noticed that a large of Yankee's was now surrounded by a detachment of Roberts Cavalry; who were being held as Prisoners of War. The engagement was ended as quickly as it began, as the Yankee's realized that they were now surrounded. At first the attack was loud enough to be heard at Washington, but then about 5 minutes later, it was becoming as quite as a mouse.He slowly rode around the now captured Union Camp and saw rows of Yankee's being held as Prisoners of War. Near were also piles of dead Yankee's; however he didn't notice a lot of Confederate causalities. There were only a few, the ones that were proper taken out by a Yankee trying to change the tide. As he passed probably the biggest of all the tents, he heard a disgruntled voice beside."General Lee, The Yankee Buford wishes to see."James turned to his left and nodded to the soldier, who was dying to kill Buford. Although, he couldn't as before the attack he gave orders to every soldier in the attack to not kill Buford unless forced. The soldiers couldn't lie if they did and turns out Buford did nothing as James could somehow see the truth in the men. He could be able to detect any lies in the men for some reason.James slowly dismounted from Traveler, as he said to the horse, "I will be back in a bit, old friend."Traveler made a noise that James understood as, "Alright."Slowly James walked inside the large tent and noticed that it was probably the command tent of the two Yankee Divisions. The reason is that there was a pair of telegraph on a desk to his left. In front of him was a large table with a large map of Falmouth and the surround areas like the small town about 5 miles away called Morgan. At his right was a desk that probably ran things like the Commanding General's documents. James could already see a list of orders that were approved by Lincoln and Hancock stacked in a pile on the desk. James decided to pick them up and look at them. The first one caught his attention.General Buford,You are to hold your current position as long as possible. If you find yourself heavenly outnumbered, then you have permission by the President to withdraw across the river to the other side of Falmouth and report the positions of the Enemy to General Hancock, until he arrives in about 5 to 6 days.Signed,Secretary of War: Benson"I knew that would be the first thing you would do. Look and see what you find about us, Jamie Lee", said a solemn voice.James looked around and saw a man in a blue uniform, with gold plated buttons. He had light blue eyes, brown hair, and a mustache that was thick at the junction below his nose. His brown hair showed his age, as they had a partial gray to it along with his mustache. His face had few signs of age, but James could clearly see them.James smiled as he said, "Well, General Buford. What can I say? I wish to end this war very quickly."John Buford sighed as he said sadly, "Don't we all. However, each side wants to be the victor and it leads to a long completion to pain and tears."James nodded, knowing exactly what he meant."How old are you, General Lee?" Buford asked, with a curious voice.James blinked, thinking of why he would be asking a question like that. He decided to go ahead and answer the question."14, sirâ¦ I mean 24." James replied, nervous about his secret coming out and being discovered. He prayed that Buford didn't catch that first part.Buford gave him a surprised look and said, "That first answer sounded pretty honest and judging by the look of your face that probably the real answer. So, I am must ask. Why fight this war at this age? And how is it that the fool Burnside get his tail beaten a 14-year-old General at Versailles?""Well, first, I fight this war to protect my native state of Virginia and bring it glory. Second, Burnside didn't know my age and still doesn't know. He got beaten by his own arrogance." James answered with honesty.Buford nodded, agreeing with the second response. However, he was not going to argue with Jamie Lee about the first answer.So he then asked, "Another thing, I must ask about General Sherman. I heard after that Charge that he did, he was wounded and captured. Is he ok?""Yes, but he is still severely hurt. He is suffering from the wounds and the doctor does not think he will live for probably about 3 to 4 years."Buford nodded, feeling sorry for Sherman."His wife has been regularly sending letters asking if he is alright or has returned from being captured." Buford thought"General, I am willing to make a deal with you. I need someone to return Sherman home to his family. He is not strong enough to run a horse by himself, so I was hoping that someone like you could maybe take him." James implied.Buford was shocked Lee's proposal and then became confused. Why? Why has someone like him set free to transport another high-ranking soldier? Lee has the perfect bargaining chip for a prisoner exchange. It doesn't make any sense. It is like letting the fish in the barrel get away and somehow get back into the ocean.He asked James, who replied with a grin, "Well, I have no need for prisoners to be exchanged as there is barely any officer in your country's hold that is being held as a Prisoner of War. Plus someone has to inform the Union what has happened tonight. Think General, about what will happen once everyone finds out that only you came out of the attack? Along with the fact that the President gave you permission to fall back to safety, it makes you the perfect scapegoat."Buford looked at Jamie Lee in shock. He could not believe how devious this teenage general was. Everything he said was true, he was the perfect scapegoat. It probably would not matter if he agreed to or not to take Sherman, he will probably still blamed by the press and Lincoln for the defeat. Even if anyone found out about Jamie's actual age, then that is adding fuel to the fire. Buford did nothing, but a nod at James as he closed his eyes; Tired from the fact that he will face humiliation. He felt his eyes began to well-up with tears.James felt sorry a little for Buford. However, he knew that War can make or break a person's reputation. It can happen to anyone. Destinies change and respect falls after a defeat. The only thing that James could do for Buford was say a prayer for his reputation to be stored after the war."I will leave you here for an hour or two. The Guard will be outside should you ever need anything. Tomorrow, you will ride to Ohio and take Sherman home to his family." James instructed.All Buford did was nod again, willing to help a fellow wounded soldier and head home in shame as he knew that his career is finished. James left the tent to head back to his Command Tent outside of Falmouth.It took about 30 minutes for him to return his as he was being cheered at by his fellow soldiers, who were always shaking his hands as a way of congratulations for his most recent victory. Many of them were offering him to join them in a drink; however, James did not have the time to. He has plans to make; another battle to prepare for.When he reached his Command Tent, he slowly stepped off Traveler. He noticed that some of the troops were circling around the tent shouting in cheerful voices, "General Lee! General Lee! General Lee!" James could not help but admire the love and appreciation that the men in this army have for him. He remembered when first took command of the Army of Mississippi, the men would call him things; like the name that the Union gave him "Jamie Lee". However, after many decisive victories, the men just stare at him like an angel of God. Things do change quickly after one proves their worth in salt.James shook his head with a smile, as he slowly went inside the tent and noticed that all the Corps Commanders of his Army were already inside and waiting for him. As he stepped inside, they all saluted, Saying "General Lee."James greeted back as he said, "Good Morning or Night, Gentlemen; depending on what you wish to call it. We have achieved a victory today. However, Gentlemen, we have another one to prepare. Hancock is his way, and based upon capture enemy reports, he will arrive at least in 5 days. So, we must begin building trench later today."Some of the Corps Commanders looked at James like as if he grew another head.Finally one spoke, James notice that it was General MacMahon of the Army's French 5th Corps, " But General, to build even more defenses to defeat the Yankee's on our terms, we need other things like fences to slow down the enemies advance in the coming battle."James nodded and replied, "and How many more days do you think that we need, General MacMahon?'MacMahon stroked his white mustache as he answered with a strong sense of honesty that fixed well with his French accent, "At least an extra couple of days, General Lee."James nodded in understanding and began to think of how he slows Hancock down to give that extra two days. Then an idea hit."General Tonks was the name of that man that informed me a week ago that he and his gang can any impossible mission?" James asked."I think his name was Jesse James, General Lee," Tonks answered."Do you know where he is?"Then it was General Bragg of 3rd Corps, who responded, "I believe that he and his gang is with my men, General. Shall I bring him to you?"All James did was nod, as Bragg had someone sent for Jesse James."Now, on to other matters gentlemen, I want all of your men to begin building trenches and primary defenses to prepare for the coming battle in less than a week. Here is how I want you all to place your men. ", James instructed putting a large map of the Falmouth region and the heights in the area along with the small town of Morgan."General Beauregard, your are to deploy your men on the Hills that we have just captured from Buford. General's Johnston and Bragg, your Corp's is to extend from where Beauregard is to all the way near to this river peninsula that looks like a tooth. Now, General Tonksâ¦" James began explaining in good detail to the rest of the Commanders.After he finished explaining positions to the Commanders, he then asked, "Any questions, gentlemen?"They all shook their heads, to which James dismissed them.James looked at the map again and began to think of the coming engagement. Questions filled his mind. Will Hancock actually attack, when he arrives? How will he fight? How much causalities should be expected? Is he forgetting any important facts or future moves that he could do to beat Hancock? Should he request more men?Then came a soft voice that said, "General?"James blinked for a second as he turned around and noticed that it was General Tonks."General, sir. Mr. James is here to see you." General Tonks informed.James nodded as he said "Very well, send him in. However, I need you to do two things, General Tonks.""Yes, General?" Tonks asked curiously."I need you to a message to the Frankfort and informed them that I require the Garrison of the City to be sent for reinforcements. However, a small portion may be left behind." James answered.General Tonks nodded as he quickly wrote that down as he asked "And what is the Second thing, General?""I wish for a message to be sent to all of Kentucky's people asking that I am willing to have the Confederate Treasury pay a man at least 20 dollars in gold a day in exchange that they help the Army of Northern Kentucky fight in the battle that is coming."Tonks was shocked, but still wrote it down as asked, "Anything else, sir?"James shocked as Tonks left to send in Jesse James and to deliver the messages.James noticed that as soon as Tonks left the tent, an overly excited teenage Jesse James came inside. James did nothing but smile at the teenager. He remembered when he received a letter from Jesse, requesting that he and his gang of Missouri Guerrillas be transferred to his Army with the promise that they do anything impossible. James decided to accept the request due to the fact that he is a teenager himself and believed that it should be fair anyways since teens are allowed to join the army anyway. He believed that Jesse can do the mission that he is going to assign him, especially with the fact that he will have in support 2 brigades of Cavalry with him."Well Corporal James," he said, "Your time to shine has come. I have a very special mission for you and your gang. You are to bring with you a few wagons of very delicate Torpedoes and plant them here."He pointed at a small map where it showed a junction where two roads are connecting into one, about 10 miles north away from Falmouth.Jesse nodded, while replying in a happy voice "It will be done, General."James nodded as he continued, "After that I want you to delay Hancock's Army as much as possible. You may do this by stealing their cavalry horses at night, sabotaging their Artillery cannons, and a few skirmishes. However, you are not to begin a major engagement or anything like that. Do you understand?"Jesse nodded very quickly like a child on sugar."Good, now, you may begin your mission right now. You are allowed to take with 2 additional brigades of Cavalry with you in support. General Tonks will lead you to where the Torpedoes are being stored. You are dismissed Corporal. Good luck and may God bless you and your gang."Jesse nodded as he gave James a salute and left to start his mission. His first mission to prove that he is a man.James sighed as he looked back at the map, thinking about how his father doing right now. So far, after receiving reports from him, he was right now in Sharpsburg, Maryland. James smiled as he knew that both McClellan and Lincoln have no idea that his father was now in their territory and threaten to move to Washington, DC and capture it; while McClellan was still in Leesburg, Virginia. However, his father will be moving to an area that has very good ground. Luckily, the ground that spies sent over was so well that it was the perfect place for his father to force McClellan to attack; Specially with the fact that Lincoln is desperate for a magnificent victory. This means that Lincoln will force his generals to do the impossible and deadly in order to boost the Union Morale.He looked at the name of the town on the map that he placed behind. It was a very detailed map of the ground that he wants his father to fortify and wait for McClellan to attack at. Its name was black and bold, James slowly touched the name. He could feel the coming victory. However, he knew that in order to ensure the success, confidence must not outweigh logic. He looked over the names of the hills that surrounded the town. Below the names were code names for them, so that when James gives an order for his father to make on a hill, the Union will not be able to know what hill he is talking about at all. Like Culp's Hill is now Satan's Touch. He even sent a message to his father instructing him to keep General Stuart near his Army and not too far, where communication is always possible. He did not want to be ass to Old Jeb, but he cannot afford any mistakes. He believed that even a small victory will make the Union believe that he has a weakness and if that happens, it will give them the hope to use that weakness and turn it against him. He knew that his father would understand and would also have Old Jeb understand.Sharpsburg, MarylandConfederate camps of the Army of Northern VirginiaRobert E. Lee listened as General Jackson explained to the other generals of the Army the importance that they reach to their designated hills once they arrived to the town that they would have the Union engage them at. Robert could only smile as he knew that way of speaking from his son. He remembered the day, when he managed to persuade the Governor of Virginia into signing a letter of recommendation to the President of the Virginia Military Institute, who was happy to accept James into the Military College. Robert smiled as he remembered seeing the look on James face, when he received his letter of accept. That cheerful smile and jumping all around the house, waving the letter like a flag that deserved respect. He even saw James sleeping with the letter in his hand. He chuckled at the memory.However, he remembered the reason why he sent James to VMI. The letter and the magical prophecy! The only person that can destroy Voldemort. Voldemort? The name sounded like as if he was claiming as if he is immortal and invincible. He chuckled as he knew its meaning, "Flight from Death". Well, he will probably be in a surprise when he discovers that the boy that he wanted to kill has become a man and can lead an Armyâ¦or even a country to victory; especially with odds that are impossible to win against. What would his face be like, then? In the past, He imaged a person that was not human, a person that had the face of Satan and with teeth that were sharper than a bayonet. Until, one night before his son went back to VMI to fight in the war and for the glory of Virginia. He had a dream that showed the face of the monster. The imaged of the demon from hell that his son would have to face.It had pale grey skin (skin that made the demon look like it was undead), a bald head that was covered by a robe with a hood that was blacker than night, and eyesâ¦oh Mary Josephineâ¦those eyes were redder than blood. They shown so bright that if one looked into them they could literally see the inside of the realm of Satan. Then he saw his face as a flame of a candle presented it. He literally lost his breath and felt his heart grow weak as he saw the face of the demon that his son would have to face in the future. It had no nose, only two straight lines that were cut to the area where they were supposed to be. The cheeks were hallowed and the lips of the demon were pale as his skin. Then the thing that frighten Robert the most was the Large Snake silvering around the demons arm. The size of it was enormous; it had to be at least 12 feet. Although, the way the snake was staring at him was like it found its lunch. Hissing its tongue in and out very fast.Then suddenly, He felt all of his strength fade always as he saw the demon raised its wand and casted the spell that he once heard from his mother."Avada Kedavra"Then came the green light hitting him and then he woke up in a startle from his wife trying to wake him up. He did with a large cold sweat on him. He remembered his wife telling him that he was shaking and turning uncontrollably and asked what happened. He told his wife about the dream and described the face of the demon along with its snake. Martha had a pale face in the thought of her son facing that demon and told him that it must be a sign from the lord. A sign that he must try harder in preparing and ensuring that James survives the war. Or else the demon, which she believed had to be Voldemort, will bring a reign of terror to both the Magical and Muggle world in the future. Robert had to agree with her as he knew that she was right. She was always right, when it comes to things like this.So, he then went to President Davis about having his Son being made a General in the Confederate Army or at least having him as his Aid-de-Camp. He remembered the reluctance Jefferson Davis had about it. However, more Generals were needed for the Army; he agreed to bring the option to Congress. Nevertheless, he should have some letters of recommendations from other officers and possibly from the President of VMI to booster James's creditability. Robert had no problem with that, both General Jackson and President Smith were happy to write the letters. He even pulled a few favors from friends in the Magical Confederate Government to dose the Muggle Congressman with a potion in their coffees and teas that will have them vote for James. Favorably, of course. He may be a Squib, but he can do a few things here and there.He was happy that he would not have to worry about James being killed while being used as a meat cutter in the front lines. When the news of James's victory at Versailles came, he grinned and celebrated with his men over the fact. Then he was invited to the Presidential Celebration Ball at the White House in Richmond along with other high-ranking officers of his army. He went only to ask President Davis a few questions about the state of the war, so far. When he went there, he recalled seeing General Jackson and his wife or Esposita, as Jackson always calls her. Those two most likely put Richmond's best dancers at jealous during the music. He smiled at the speed of their dancing and the love that they showed to the whole city.He then, finally, managed to have a talk with Jefferson Davis in his Presidential Office. As he asked if the Union are willing to negotiate peace at the moment. Jefferson replied that Lincoln sent a direct message saying basically that they will continue fighting. Robert sighed at the memory. He could not believe this, Lincoln knows that he is losing the war and should sign peace to end this war. Or else the blood that the Union have spilled will be brought into the northern states, causing more radical movements for peace in Washington and all over the country. However, he could not help and admire the determination that the Yankee President has in the cause."If given the chance, he would send in children into the Union Army to free the Southern Slaves.", he thought.He understood Lincoln's reasons to want to end slavery. He and James both understood. However, there has to be other ways than this, to say it and threaten it directly would force the South to fight for it. The South was once too independent in slaves. Until, James managed to introduce the Negro Enlistment Act to Jefferson and even asked Congress to try to find ways to increase the production of the Confederacy. Both of these actions proved to be very successful. However, he recollected Vice-President Alexander Stephens and Actor John W. Booth stating that was against the values that the South was based upon and denounced James as a Traitor paid by the Union to disrupt the Southern Economy. Although, After Versailles and Fort Henry, they lost support in that belief."Excuse, Me. General Lee.", came a voice that Robert knew too well.He turned around and knew that it his Aid-de-Camp, Major Walter Taylor."General Stuart is inside the Headquarters and is also ready to see you." Major Taylor explained.General Lee sighed as he knew that it was going to be an unpleasant talk. It understood James's reasoning, but it hurt Jeb Stuart. He nodded and walked into the small house not far. The owner of the home was happy to lend his home to the Confederate Army and was honored. It was not luxurious, but it was enough for him to use. Slowly, he passed through rotted old wooden door of the house and saw General Jeb Stuart of his Cavalry Corps standing beside the door. He wore his standard Cavalry Grey Uniform, with his impeccable hat that had a feather on top. His beard was like a thick as a bush. Robert smiled as he told Jeb to close the door and then be seated. Jeb nodded slowly, he could see a little anguish in the man. He knew what was coming. Lord, knows he would be like that as well. However, this talk must happen as Stuart is developing a sense of betrayal towards his son.He noticed Jeb close the door a little hard, but not enough to get anyone's attention. He slowly walked beside the chair next to his, then he said with angry, "General Lee, I refuse to sit, as your son orders me not go pass at most 20 miles from the Army. 20 miles! General, that is only enough to screen a battlefield. Not enough to sneak and destroy Union Cavalry as my missions have been at times. I know that I mostly have been only doing screening of Armies. However, I know how to engage Union Cavalry; I can do any impossible mission and at the same time send in report of Union positions. Then, Your son sends in that order, like as if he is questioning the quality I have in this Armyâ¦"Lee held his hand out to stop Jeb Stuart, while rubbing his eyes. He thought for a minute and then looked back at Jeb's glaring blue eyes as they became darker and darker. His hair stand up as if trying to touch the ceiling.He then spoke with a soft and caring voice, "General Stuart, I know how you feel about the order James sent to you. However, let me explain. First, James does not doubt nor questions your abilities and quality to this Army. In fact, he is pleased and is impressed about it. He loves a cavalry man like you. Second, He knows that you are willing to do things that no one can else cannot do. He knows what that is like himself. Lastly, he is giving the order due to the fact that the plans that has been made by this operation does not require you and your cavalry to do as much scouting as you have done before. However, another reason that he gave the order, it is due to the fact that a Cavalryman loves to do some joy-ridding and there have been a few times that you have done that. ..""But sirâ¦" Stuart exclaimed with shock."Those were excusable and understandable. However, James is worrying over the state in the war. Even though, we are winning. It will only take one huge defeat and then everything will be for nothing. Then, our Allies will believe that we are at defeat and stop helping, then leave us to the Union. James does not want that to happen. Like I have said earlier, he does not question or doubt your quality. He is just concerned." Lee continued as he looked down.Jeb looked down as he pulled out his sword and presented it Lee, speaking in a sad tone, "General, Seeing as your son has no use of my Corps, I wish toâ¦""THERE IS NO TIME FOR THAT! THERE IS NO TIME!" Robert yelled with a few tears, as he then took a deep breath and continue, "General, that it not what I mean. He and I have other uses for your Cavalry. It is just that we need you men intact for those uses. You must understand that. I know that you are not happy about the order. I know that with all my heart, it just we have our orders. We must follow those orders whether we like then or not. Orders are not meant to be loved, they are meant to be followed and done. So, as a Soldier, you must follow that order; even if it enrages you. However, James will make it up to you; I know my Son and he will do something in return. You just have to do as ordered and follow it. Do you understand, General?"Jeb Stuart nodded in tears as he said slowly, "Yes, sir."Lee walked up to Jeb and placed the sword back into the holder, as he looked into the sad eyes as the Cavalrymen and hugged him."Let us speak no more of this and do our duty as a soldier. Alright, General Stuart?"Jeb nodded as he apologized for his ruddiness. Lee nodded as he said that it was understandable. As Jeb slowly walked outside to sleep back at his tent.Robert sighed as he felt the pain of yelling at someone that he considered as another son. He wished that he did not do, but it was too late. Now, he must watch as Jeb tries to prove his worth in salt in the coming battle. Even though, both he and James knew that it was not necessary. Slowly, he went to the bed next to him and heard Major Taylor walk inside as he tucked him in to the bed, so that he sleep. He slept feeling a pain in chest over what happened. However, he knew that it would be temporally. As he felt in to the land of dreams, he prayed for this war to end. It has gone on for too long with blood being spilt by the body.Hey, everyone. I am really sorry, again. I know this is becoming a habit and I have no real excuse, only that I had college as a bigger priority. However, I have come to a compromise with myself to where I can do a little work on the next chapter each day. I plan to at least do 500 words each weekday and on weekend days, including Fridays, at least 750 words. Hopefully, this plan will have the next chapter done by the end of next month. I promise everyone that and if it is going to be late, I will let everyone know.Now, about this chapter, I worked hard on it and stay up late to finish it. However, I am glad to complete it. If there is any grammar problems, please feel let me know and tell me how I should fix. I know that I am not perfect, but I will to make this story as much enjoyable as possible. It is just I have flaws in write a storyâ¦hell, I even have flaws in write an essay and have to have it check by the College Writing Center and by the tutors that I have. So, I am now thinking of hiring a Beta to help me make sure that this story is making sense and is also grammarly correct. If anyone wishes to beta my story, be sure to PM me and give me at least a week to look over your please works to see the experience and quality that you have for this story.Another thing, in case anyone is confused on what is a civil war torpedo, it is basically a land mine.Now, besides all of that, please give some feedback off how you felt, liked, or did not like about the story/chapter. Until next time, the Chapter of the fictional Battle of Falmouth. This might be a long chapter.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter and Gods and Generals.Hello, Everyone. I know that this is becoming a habit. But I have a legit excuse. I was during summer school and now in the Fall semester in college as well as a part-time work-study job at the college. So, at times, I would stay up late studying and would put my own education above my own health. However, on 4th of July, I literally fell through my ceiling and hurt my back by landing on my ass. I am recovering and have (luckily) no injuries that require surgery. Although, I learned a crucial lesson and that is "stay on boards; never stand on the sheetrock!"However, while I was busy, I have been thinking on the plot of the story in ending the war. I have been studying the terrain of the city called Falmouth. Yes, it is a real place. It is about 60 miles southeast of Cincinnati. It is surrounded by the South Fork Licking River and Licking River. It has high grounds that would make it the perfect battlefield. More will be explained in the chapter, I think. However, before I continue the story, there is something that I state and reply to. After I had posted the chapter before this one, a guest reviewer commented in a coarse and unprofessional manner. This is summarized version, "Do you hate your F**king country?" I will answer this by saying that I do not hate my country. In fact if I had the opportunity, I would be proud to die for it in times of war (I am not in the armed forces but support it) and am to live in it. The reason why I made this story was original to recreate the events that were happening during the war. However, as time went by, I was curious on how the South could have won the war. That being said, no, I am not one of those people that believe that the South was not fighting for slavery. I know better, Slavery was the main reason why the war happened. I read part of the Texas (my home state) and South Carolina (the state that left the union first) Ordnances of Secession; to which proves that the war was mostly about slavery. Now, Enough about this, on to the chapter.July 1, 1862, at 9:30 A.M. Falmouth, Kentucky, C.S.A.James watched as the troops got up and formed at the trenches. It has been a week and now Hancock's 2nd Ohio has finally arrived to fight. As each day passed, men from all over the state of Kentucky took James's offer and rode the military train's in Lexington and Frankfort to the grounds. So far over 10,000 men came with their own muskets or from the Frankfort Armory. Then the City Guard came with about 12,000 men. James smiled; currently his Army has about 122,000 men; while Hancock has 91,000 men. As President Lincoln ordered Hancock to send 3 corps over to support McClellan's Army of the Potomac and Heintzelman's Army of the Northeast. As his father's Army was discovered at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and the British Army in Maine was making a march towards Boston.He will admit, he did not expect the British to make any kind of attack this soon, but perhaps it was because they may have learned something from the First War of Independence and War of 1812. James could tell that Lincoln was on a last breath of hope. For if he suffers anymore defeats in either front and then the war is lost. There will be no way that the Union will be to build a formidable force to hold back either front. Congress will demand an armistice and end to the war. However, James knew that he must ensure that will be a bond of friendship between the Union and the Confederacy. If nothing were done to attain that then in the future, there would be hate and rivalry between the Union and the Confederacy. Then the Union will try to gain allies that will help her conquer the south and do away with Confederacy. He knew that it must be his job to ensure that. "God provides the brains and the ability to achieve a person's desire, so then I must use them!" he thought to himself.Then he thought about after the war, he believed that to achieve the goal, he will have to either be an ambassador or congressman. To him, it was obvious that Congress will be more efficient. Nevertheless, he will have to start in the House of Representatives; as everyone believed that he was 24. On his next birthday, he will be eligible to qualify to be a Representative of the House for the midterm 1864 Elections for both the House and Senate. He believed to help his goal even better was to form his own political party; especially to help make the confederacy a better place to live in. He already had an idea of the policies that his Party would follow, like Industrialization, Fiscal, and even Progressivism. Like this, the nation needs to be ready to progress into the coming new century. James feared that the growth of Imperialism in Europe will lead to a force of evil that history will forever know in the 20th century; a force that he believed will challenge the Confederacy's Independence. However, James knew that the future will not come if this battle was not won.He looked over at where Hancock's tired army was formed up at across the other side of the South Fork Licking River. It was no doubt that this would not be a position that Hancock would wish to attack him at. If he were him, he would move over to his left and completely force him to follow him to Frankfort. As the river would be a challenge to crossover, especially for artillery. There are few bridges to use for only a Brigade at a time. Especially, since Hancock has even less Artillery and horses for Calvary than he had before leaving Cincinnati; thanks to Corporal Jessie James, who had been effective in stealing Cannon and Horses from Hancock's Army.How he did that, he will never know. However, all that James cared about was that the mission was done and Hancock's Army is weak as well as tired. Since the Torpedoes took the Union by surprise and the number of hit  run attacks lowered their numbers. It was oblivious to James that Hancock is probably begging to President Lincoln to allow him to withdraw to the small town of Butler up north or force James to follow him to Frankfort. So, James decided to listen to the messages that were being exchanged, after having his other cavalry units connect him to the lines that Hancock was sending and receiving messages through. His officers had once asked him why not do what he did to Burnside at Versailles. To which he replied, "It was effective once, but twice is like knowing a Play by heart; you know that lines that are going to be spoken."So he knew that it was best to know what is going to happen, instead of making it happen. James went into the tent used for telegraphs and decoding; as after Versailles the union begun using a code to protect their messages. However, all it took was a few well-paid Spies that were once for the union (but now for peace to be made) and then the code was cracked. So it was very easy to gain a victory when all people wanted is peace. As soon as he stepped inside the tent, a clerk handed him a letter that was just decoded. James thanked him as he read the message. General Hancock, You are ordered by the President to attack the Rebels as soon as possible. Secretary of War: Stevenson James smiled as he knew that exact place that Hancock is going to attack first.Union Camp of the 2nd OhioWinfield Hancock looked at the map that was drawn by scouts that went ahead of the Army. He stared at the way that the enemy was developed across. James Lee was completely entrenched and the advantages of the river. The river would slow would slow his Army down, especially with the fact that Jamie Lee stole about a quarter of his cannon and horses. How this happened, he still has no idea. However, this meant that this battle will be more costly on his side. Leeâ¦well, he would barely have a scratch with those trenches and other weapons of defense that he built. Hell, he just learned that Lee built a road that would transport the food and supplies from the side of the front to another; it is even made to have the movement of reserve in troops that Lee needs to hold the line."This is not the place to fight a battle against Lee. He has too many advantages on his side. We should have Lee follow us to Frankfort. However, the President will not approve such a move, especially with the papers demanding a quick victory or an armistice." He thought.Then came in the message to attack Lee from Secretary of War: John Stevenson. Hancock signed, this first day will be costly. With his Army already tired from the continuous skirmishes by Jessie James and the torpedoes that the Army hit at a junction not far from Falmouth. He could tell that the morale was low and there were already desertions everywhere in his Army. He knew that he had to attack James Lee at a place that will force him to move out of the trenches and possibly withdraw from the battlefield.The heights that are looking over the town that Beauregard's 1st Corps were occupying that would be the place to push James far enough to reform his lines out of the trenches. However, the problem was how many reserves did Lee have in support? With 3 corps less than he received, he would be at risk of being overwhelmed by Lee's Army unless he received reinforcements. But the President will not make such a move as the Union was in danger of being dissolved. Without any other option, he gave General Banks Corps the order to attack Lee at the town heights. He, then, decided to have McDowell and Reynolds Corp's to attack Lee's center to cause a distraction.12:30 P.M.James watched from behind the front lines of General George Pickett's division as they continued to hold back against the stubborn Yankee's. They kept coming and coming up the Hill that overlooked Falmouth, like as if they were determined to win this war with the impossible odds that are against them. James could not help, but admire these blue boys as they are willing to die in the belief of preserving the Union. He watched as troops that came from General Nathaniel Banks Corps, making multiple attacks in hopes of tiring out the Virginian boys of Pickett's Division and the Corps of General Beauregard. In the field ahead, he could see the piles of blue bodies that fell to the strong defenses of the Southern Army.He then heard General Pickett yell to his men, "Stand fast, boys! General Lee is watching, let us shows that we are proud to fight with our fellow Virginian General."The men cheered as they continued firing at the valley of charging Yankee's.General Pickett rode over to James on a brown horse and having a smile that reminded James of a Child on Christmas. He saluted James, as he was right beside him.James greeted back as he asked "General Pickett, what is the status of your men?""General Lee, my men are still strong and willing to fight. We still have plenty of ammunition to kill everyone of them Yankee's sooner or later, they will give up." General Pickett replied."excellent. Just keep the Yankee's at bay. It is imperative that we have control of this hill.""Don't worry, sir, we will not let you down."James nodded as he decided to ride with Traveler over to his command tent. He repeatedly sent messages to his father on what should and needs to be done all the way at Gettysburg. It was not easy to control two fronts at the same time, but James was very efficient at it and it was part of his duties as General-In-Chief of the Confederate Army. So far, he learned that McClellan is engaging his father, but has failed to gain any ground and loses a high number of troops. His father estimated that it that the number of dead Yankee's is about 10,000. It would definitely not be a good number for the Yankee Newspapers to learn.Then as the day went on, James got reports that Reynolds and McDowell's Corps were advancing to engaged Johnston and Bragg's Corps. James smirked as he knew that there are torpedoes placed on the land that divided between the river and the Confederate trenches. So there will already be causalities before they even fire a shot. This will do without a doubt cause some rout inside of the ranks as they advanced. Although, in case if they are putting more pressure than expected, then he will have his Brother Robert Jr.'s Corps behind the other corps for emergencies.He gave the orders to the courier, who saluted James as he rode off. James turned his attention to the positions of Johnston's and Bragg's Corps; as they were being engaged by the 2 Yankee Corps. He could see McDowell's smaller corps was in a double column by Divisions were in the midst of routing as they suffered the most causalities. James could see the piles of blue coats that was laying on the ground dead, most were killed by the torpedoes that were planted. James looked to where Reynolds Corps were advancing. He could see that the whole corps, too, is in double column; using the second row as a reserve as the first row began marching and firing. It was very effective as each brigade took a few steps and fired, as the second row moved ahead and got a few more steps ahead of the first rows position to fire off a volley.However, there was one flaw to the tactic. It made it very easy for the Confederate cannons to fire massive amounts of cannons balls and explosive shells at the Yankee's. Even with the ones that Jessie James managed to steal for him. Slowly it was becoming a slaughter house as the cannons were tearing up Reynolds lines. It was then James noticed that the second line began to retreat after an hour of intensive artillery firing upon them. He watched as they ran towards the river and the strangest thing happened. He saw a man in an ornate blue Uniform riding up to the lines to reform his men. James could tell that this man was a General from his binoculars. However, he was not sure which type. He was pretty sure that it was not Hancock because this General had a much larger beard than what he saw in the Yankee newspapers of Hancock. Then suddenly, a cannonball exploded right behind the poor General and his horse. It was obvious that he was wounded by the explosion as he fell right on the earth in front of his horse and then came another explosive round hit the horse. The horse severely wounded and dying fell on top of his rider. His men already shocked by the amount of cannon firing at them ran like flies and began to move even faster to the safety of the river and bridge. Only a handful stayed to help the dying General out of the dead horse on top of him and carried him to nearby Hospital.James felt sorry for the man as he knew that shrapnel inside the cannon balls would no doubt deal a mortal wound to a man. He knew that the chances of him surviving were slim. He felt even sorrier for the family of that General, losing a member of the family is something that he never wishes to experience. It was one of those things that gave him the desire to end this war as soon as possible; his brothers all volunteered in the Confederate Army at the start of the war. When he got the position of General-In-Chief, he wanted to give them all desk jobs; but he knew that if he did that they would never forgive him. So he allowed them to have an active duty.He tried to stop thinking about it as he watched the first line of Yankee's were all running as they heard the news that the General was severely wounded. The entire engagement at the center lasted for only a couple of hours, James knew that Hancock was most likely done in this section for today. However, James was not as it was only the opening act and he was going to wait where Hancock is vulnerable; then he is going to show him the finishing act. An act that would have the entire Yankee Army on run to Butler. It was something he orders to be made during the construction of the trenches. He had this idea in his pocket since Versailles, in case it was needed for only one time.He did not want to waste a trick like this. Although, he wondered what will history will say about him when he does this action. Will he be known as a monster like Genghis Khan or a hero like George Washington? He knew it depends on the side that asks that question. It is one thing to be remembered as a man that fought a nation that he was once loyal to, in the honor of his home state of Virginia. Virginia was his blood. If she dies then so does he. Her heart controls his determination to fight in her honor and glory. Should her heart stop beating then he will have nothing to live for.Then he received a message from his father at Gettysburg, saying:My Son, We have managed to hold on to the heights and suffered little causalities. Although, I cannot say the same for the Federals as the field is covered with their dead and wounded. Tomorrow, shall we continue the battle with Meat or Fruit Rations?Your Loving Farther,Robert E. Lee C.S.A. General of the Army of Northern VirginiaJames smiled as he knew what that last sentence meant. His father was asking whether he should continue letting McClellan to attack (in the code of Fruit Rations) or attack McClellan at first light when he least expects it (in the code of Meat Rations). He did this to confuse McClellan, in case he was listening to his messages and was going to take advantage of it. Plus, it was entertaining the thought of what Lincoln and McClellan are thinking that each one of the two means."Tell him to continue with the Fruit Rations," James ordered the telegraph, officer."Yes, sir." The soldier saluted with much confusions and hesitation.James laughed as he listenings everything went quiet. The sound of silence was intense as there was not a sound that could be heard in the camps. James then realized that the fight over at the town heights must be over and that Pickett, as well as Bueragrad, held on as they pushed the Yankee's back. He looked at the time on his pocket watch and saw that it was forty minutes past three. He decided to see what the current condition of Pickett's division was. Slowly, he rode over to the heights and thought of the coming peace that he knew that he would enjoy.July 2, 18629:00 A.M.It was at Breakfast when James begin to seriously consider the plan he laid out. He really was not sure about it. The hole the project would create will be an obstacle and a massacre to climb over, so he knew that they must go around it. Several Divisions of Forrest's Cavalry Corps would be needed to direct both Granger's and McMahon's Corps around it. This would be the best route as if the Infantry just charged ahead into the crater then they will be trapped in the crater and surrounded by Yankee's, who would without a doubt make it into a turkey shoot. This would be a tremendous morale boost for the retaliation and press, who will indeed create a war cry that will lead the Yankee's united under Lincoln. This was something James needs to avoid or else the war will turn.However, he cannot attack the Yankee's like they did to him yesterday; that will get him nowhere. Even if they do not have as much cannon as he does, the river will slow his men down to where the Yankee's will aim at them like as if they were hunting for fish. He knew that this move will be the only way to have Hancock running and for him to play chase with him all the way to Ohio. He called for the Chief Engineer of his useful Engineer Division, these were the men he could count on to complete an engineering task that required hard work and determination; they were willing to build anything that James needed. They were even ready to make him his own plantation in Virginia after the war.Before Hancock had arrived, James had them construct a massive tunnel that had several chambers at places that he assumed where Hancock would put his army. The chambers that the Yankee army were above them would be filled with a large amount of gun powered and explosives after the order was given. Then after that task was completed, a long line of fuses would be set up from the barrels to the entrance of the tunnels. James was still not sure about this plan, he felt that it was dirty. Like as if it was a sin against God to fight at this level of extreme. He remembered what he told Colonel Freemantle about Warfare changing, but this is a radical change. He always did not like a radical shift for he believed it was something that should not be down at a quick pace. Some things need more something for a change.When the Chief Engineer came to see him, he knew that it was now or never. He could feel his lips dry out as he gave the orders for chambers 1 and 2 to be filled with explosives. The Chief Engineer nodded as he saluted happily at James, as he went to start the orders he had been given by the famous General Harry James Lee also known as the Napoleon of the Confederacy.James closed his eyes as he wept tears hoping that the heavenly father will forgive him for the sins that he will commit on this day. He went to his journal to write in his memoirs of how he felt about this move and the possible aftereffects that would come. He kept this journal with him since the start of the war, as a book that will explain to future generations of how the Confederate War of Independence was fought and won. He read Napoleon's Memoirs and was inspired to be someone great; someone, that was not afraid to die for his country or state. It was only fair that people will hear his thoughts of his strength to fight; just like he read Napoleon's.In the next hour, he decided to ride over to where the entrance to the tunnel was. He watched as he saw his men loading barrels of gunpowder in the entrance. They rolled it careful to the chambers that were to be filled. James watched as the men were joking about what a 'Good Rebel Morning' it will be for the Yankee's. James always looked as he decided to check on both General Granger's 6th British Corps and McMahon's French Corps. As he did not want to be there to see the mighty explosion that was going to surprise the enemy.2nd Ohio Camps10:32 A.M.Winfield Hancock was nervous and scared. He was sweating from every pore in his body, as his uniform became soaked with his own sweat. The reason being was that his adversary in the Army of Northern Kentucky was quite in communications with Richmond, Virginia. Lee was always sending telegraph messages to someone at least every hour. Like yesterday, during the disastrous attack, he kept sending to both Richmond and Bobby Lee in Gettysburg on the current situation over here in Falmouth. If Jamie Lee is quite then, something was going to happen and it was not going to be good for him. That something is what scares him, what exactly could James be up to? Is he going to attack him? Is he going to pass around and play follow the leader to Ohio? Or is he going to raid his forces of their weapons and supplies again?He is in the unknown and is pretty sure that Jamie Lee knows that; so he is going to do something that he will not forget. He sent another message to the President asking him to give permission to move to Ohio and fortify quickly. But he was denied and instructed to continue the engagement as well as that reinforcements will arrive by the end of the week. Hancock knew Lee, the probably knows that is going to do something to delay those reinforcements. Winfield even believed that by the time they arrive, his Army will already be eliminated. So he had two options: disobey a presidential order and retreat back to Ohio or continue the fight and pray that the reinforcements arrive to support him.He looked at his pocket watch and noticed that it was 10:50 A.M. He knew that it take at least 5 hours till the Army is ready to withdraw. So it was better to start now and escape from whatever idea Lee had. He was just about to give the order to have his army prepare to withdraw from the city until suddenly. BOOM! And the ground around him shock; knocking him down to the ground. Hancock knew what cannons sounded like but that this was no cannon. It felt like it was coming from underground. He was in fear, was this what Lee planned and where was it from? He could not comprehend that it could have happened to his own lines. Then came a second explosion. This one was just as powerful as it too knocked Hancock to the ground.He quickly got up and ran outside of his tent to see right in front of him were two large black smoke clouds in the shape of mushrooms, located where the Corps of both General's Hooker, Sickles, and Reynolds or what remains of it."This was his plan the whole time. He had another reason to have me here. He is attacking me by having my Army divided by two crater's. Lee is fighting in depths that no man has seen before. With the two crater's, He is going to have his men charge and then rip my men to scatters. And he has nothing to stop him now.", Hancock thought.However, He was going to try to plug in the gaps. Everything that can be done will be done, even if it was in vein. Quickly he gave the order for Sykes Corps, who was supporting Banks tired Corps near the town, to move to the craters and assist in defending against the incoming rebels. However, one thing that he did not think, that too was what James anticipated him to do and would make a move that Hancock did not expect.James looked ahead from the small town of Morgan to see the huge mushroom cloud on the Yankee lines. He wept as he knew that the sin was done and now he had to pray to God for forgiveness. Slowly, he looked away and looked at the lines of British and French troops; who were in awe and shock at the size of the explosion as well as its aftermath. James did not want to see what his sin had done but knew that everything in it was inhumane.Then he thought, "War is inhumane!"However, he knew that it is too late to change the past, he must go through with this as he remembered that he is fighting for his home state of Virginia. That is what important, his home. His home is why he is fighting against the nation that he had once been a proud citizen of. He knew that this war has been already bloody and painful to all sides as well as that with this move he could bring this war even closer to an end. He quickly gave the order for Granger and McMahon's Corps to advance around the crater's.He watched as the British and French advanced, as the French Musicians played a loud song that he was sure Lincoln could hear at Washington. James remembered hearing those musicians play the song at the welcoming Military Parade back in Frankfort. If there were one word that James could describe the song, then it would be exquisite. He remembered talking with a young French Colonel Jean Delacour explaining to him that it is called La Victoire est a Nous; which is means "Victory is ours" in French. It was the song that played for the Old Guards attack on Wellington's center at Waterloo. James could see how Napoleonic these French troops were, even though they were most they are a part of the Foreign Legion. They had uniforms that were identical to the Napoleonic Wars. He thought the French as people that were firm and fair at Europe.However, He knew that Napoleon the Third was going to make a move in North America while the Union was busy in trying to keep itself together and united. If he were him, he would challenge the Monroe doctrine and expand his influence of a Monarchy upon Mexico; so that he can gain a valuable ally in America. The reason Mexico would be the choice is because of its past as an unstable country. As it went through more governments than he can count. It was obvious to him that Napoleon would demand in return for helping in the war, that the Confederacy assists him in this plan.James was not sure if he should be worried over this until he heard someone call his name. He turned and saw that it was a courier from his brother's, Robert Lee Jr, Reserve Corps."Sir, forgive me, your brother has instructed me to ask you if he can commence his flanking attack on Banks unsupported Corps?"James began to think for at minute as he looked back to where he could see that Granger and MacMahon have successful managed to go around the crater's. They were now in the process of pushing the Yankee's back and dealing a heavy blow to them. He could see that the Yankee's were tired and fighting hard to make some kind of difference. It was then he knew now is the perfect moment."Now! Now! Now is the moment to end this battle and bring this war to a quicker end. Then I can go and beg for forgiveness to the Lord." He thought to himself.He nodded as he said, " Yes! Yes, he may. He can tell that he can begin his attack to push the enemy off the field and if he desires reinforcements to let me know."The courier nodded as he gave a quick salute and rode off to belay the orders for his General.James looked back at the ensuing battle at the top of the craters. As he waited to see the end of it as he knew if he wins this war is fully won and the Yankee's will never be able to mount a counteroffensive ever again in this front of the war. This battle was already bloody, but he knew that it was just about to get even bloodier as the day ended. He could hear the screams of men from both sides, as well as the piles and piles of bodies in different colors, fall into the crater after being slain. He watched as this battle would last for another 5 hours as the Yankee's were being pushed into so many directions after their right flank was routed and running towards Ohio. They could only take so much, especially as his brother was attacking from their left flank. Then came in Beauregard's corps from Falmouth, where the pressure was too much and the whole Yankee Army began retreating to Ohio. Leaving their dead, wounded, and medical equipment behind without a second thought.He gave orders for the enemies wounded to be treated and given the utmost care. There was even a large number of Yankee Prisoners of War. He had his men count both the dead, wounded, and captured Yankee's to see how much exactly did Hancock lose. It turns out that Hancock lost more than a third of his Army; 37,000 men and out of that 21,000 were dead. James smiled a little, with losses like that the only thing Hancock can do is be on the defensive and hope for a miracle. Then James began thinking that he should follow Hancock and catch him at a point to force him to surrender. However, his men were still tired from the 2 days of fighting. But they were still willing to follow him in any impossible task. He could feel their loyalty to him.He decided that while his father was still fighting over at Gettysburg and forcing McClellan to attack till he makes a mistake. This way even if Lincoln is still stubborn after hearing of Hancock's and soon McClellan's defeat, the news of Hancock's future surrender will give him no choice but to negotiate peace or face a possible Impeachment from Congress. James felt a thrill of excitement as he knew that soon the war will be over and the blood spilling will end. Then his lovely state of Virginia will be safe at last and independent from the Yankee's."Hancock's Army is most likely still an unorganized mob. It will be like Manassas all over again, only this time the Confederacy takes the advantage." He thought to himself, trying to forget about his feelings about the sins that he committed.He gave the orders to Tonks, Bragg, Johnston, and Rob to have their corps ready to peruse for Hancock's Army. It turned out that his gamble paid off a few days later.August 5th, 1862Washington, D.C.Executive Mansion, Oval Office"Are you sure there is not a way that the Southern States will rejoin the union? Seeing as they have proven their determination to preserve the institution of slavery, "asked a desperate Lincoln to James.James could not help but admire the stubbornness in wanting to keep the Union as one. It has been weeks since he managed to defeat Hancock's Army at Falmouth and then surround him about 20 miles northwest of Falmouth. It was very easy as Hancock was just trying to get his Army back to Ohio as soon as possible. However, as soon as James managed to surround the General, he surrendered immediately to save lives. He made an Unconditional surrender that he signed in front of James as a photograph was taken of the event.Then he heard the news of McClellan's defeat at Gettysburg on the 4th of July. It turned out that the Yankee General tired his Army enough to where as soon as General Jackson attacked it was a very quick rout of the whole Yankee. Then began the march to When the news came to the Yankee newspapers, the Yankee began demanded an Armistice or else Lincoln will face an Impeachment. Lincoln complied and on July 15th, he negotiate with the Coalition forces of the Confederates, French, and British. James was happy to hear the news as it was now clear that the War is won and that the South is now free of the Yankees. However, he knew he had one more thing to do to ensure it was over for good. He sent a private correspondence to President Davis in asking to be a part of the Peace Commission that would be negotiating with Yankee's in ending this war in a permanent manner.President Davis was happy to put James in the Commission; in fact he made him in charge of the Commission. He headed the Commission with Vice-President Alexander Stephens and Secretary of State Robert Toombs. James was determined to make peace in any way possible to end a strong friendship between the two nations sure. However, he was not going to demand a lot; only the areas that were run by the Confederacy. He could tell that Stephens had a different idea and wanted a lot from the Union. It obvious that James will have to control him and decided to speak before Stephens causes problems."Mr. Lincoln, you must understand that the Confederacy has already voted to leave the Union and that we are not fighting for slavery anymore. We fought for our independence from the Union. The child has already left the house and has become independent enough to not live off his parents.", James explained to the disgraced President.Abraham Lincoln smiled at the last part as he nodded while Stephen glared daggers at James. Stephens was a little bit over 50 years old with signs of aging over his face, eyes that are light brown, and wore a professional business suit.He then asked, "and what exactly is it that the Southern States demand with their independence?"Stephens was about to answer the question, but James quickly beat him to it."Both me and President Davis have agreed that we want the Union to recognize the Independence of the Confederate States along with that the organized territory in Confederate control below the 37th Parallel, and for state of Maryland to hold a referendum in determining whether or not to join the Confederacy. That's all and no reparations.""WHAT?", Stephens yelled at James."Is that so? but you are asking for a lot of land in return of the promise of peace. Especially where the Southern States will have half of California in their sphere.", Lincoln said, who was a little shocked for he expects to hear some kind of significant demand that was bigger than that."Me and the President also agreed that in return the Confederacy will hand over half of the state of Missouri above the river and Ohio County in Virginia; also, should Maryland stay in the Union then Virginia will also give up the counties of Accomack and Northampton to the Union," James explained.The 16th President of the United States did not know what to think, he really did not want to accept the deal. However, he knew that the people were losing hope in the stability in keeping the Union together. His only hope now was to make peace and start a reconstruction process for the Union. If the Rebels were demanded reparations, then it will be easy to repair the Union."If it goes through Congress, then I will sign it." he replied.James nodded as he said "Very well, we are done for the day. You have a beautiful day, Mr. Lincoln."Slowly, he walked out of the office with Stephens behind him. Just as he walked out and got to the end of the hallway, Stephens pushed him against the wall."What the hell do you think you're doing? Have you got no honor for the South? Of course, Slavery is what we fought for. And what about the reparations, how do you suppose the South should be repaired after fighting this war without them?", Alexander Stephens growled."The South can increase its exports to help in the reconstruction process. And sir, Slavery may have been what we fought for in the beginning; however, that has changed, we fought for States Rights and the Independence of the Confederacy. I understand that you have a different opinion on the spoils of war, but the President has left me in charge of negotiations. So if you have a problem with me, you can telegraph the President." James replied calmly."You know what you do whatever you want because the President will most likely ignore me on the issue. I will not take part in a scheme to destroy the values of the South; and you better watch it, Lee, because not everyone has the same opinion that you have over those God damn Negros and will want to stomp you like the little Niger lover you are." Stephens exclaimed as he let go of James and walked away.James shook his head as he thought Stephens was thinking politically of what he said and his reputation was already strong enough that his views will not damage it. If only he knew that Stephens also meant physically in the next few years.Finally, I am done with this chapter and soon I put James on his own timeline. Again, I am sorry for taking so long.

Disclaimer: I do not Harry Potter and Gods  Generals.Hey, Everyone. I have finally managed to find time to work on this next chapter. So, this is the chapter that will result in James/Harry being sent back to his time. Another thing is that I am setting up a vote to help decide if James should end up with a harem and if yes who (besides Tonks). The vote will last until the next chapter is up, which will most likely be in late December. Before I begin, I would leave a little dedication to the People of France including Paris, as they are going through a moment in history that they will never forget. Let us hope that Justice will be served for them as it has been for America in 9/11. Remember Paris!April 20, 1867Washington, D.C., C.S.A.Meeting Hall of the House of Representatives, Capitol BuildingJames listened to the constant arguing from the men that opposed the bill that he had presented to the House of Representatives. About of half of them were stating that the approval of this bill would bring the end of the South. He watched as some of them were throwing insults like crazy at him. He could see that they were a part of the new political party that Alexander Stephens formed after the signing as well as ratification of the Treaty of Washington. James could say that he was happy the war was finally over. However, he knew that more had to be done to ensure the security of this country.One of the first things that he did after the war was to recommend the Former Governor of Texas, Sam Houston, as the Confederate Ambassador to the United States. He knew that Houston was not very popular in the Confederacy with his Unionist views, but he was the best man that can bring a strong friendship between the Union and the Confederacy. The public was at first suspicious, but let it go as James gave them the idea that it would help bring a trade agreement between the two nations. Then he decided when the Congressional elections came in 1863 to run as a Representative from Virginia. His opponent did not even stand a chance of winning; especially after trying to criticize James's service during the War of Independence with the use of former slaves. This turned out to his worst mistake as the buffoon was booed by the audience as they threw things like fruits and vegetables at him. They even tried to burn down the poor man's house, which resulted in him dropping out of the election. Leaving James become one of the 16 Virginian Representatives in Congress. A few months before it, he resigned his position as General-in-Chief to the Confederate Army and recommend General Thomas Jackson to replace him. Many would compare it to when George Washington resigned his commission to the continental Army.The people in Virginia celebrated for this as they also heard the news that General Tonks was successful in helping the French in Mexico as a way of thanks to Napoleon the Third. It was then James decided to form his own Political Party to face up against Stephen's Nationalist Party; which was following the views of Nationalism and the preservation of Slavery. So, James meet with other Congressmen to create the Confederalist Party; which hold the views of Fiscal policies, Progressivism, and Industrialization. His party turned out to be very popular as they managed to get a majority in the House and the newly created Supreme Court of the Confederacy; however, not in the Senate. He knew that if he wanted to ensure that he got the bill to be passed by Congress was to get the people to demand it to be passed.However, this particular bill will require a lot of convincing to get the people on his side. The reason as this bill would end slavery in the next fifteen years. Many of the Nationalist Politicians called it James's Folly, as they believed that it would end his popular reputation. However, so far, it was them being wrong. As James remained calm during the times, insults were given to him, as he remembered the advice that Sam Houston gave to him before heading to New York, which became the new capital of the Union after the succession of Maryland. The advice heard was "always be calm and remain practical." James kept to it during the sessions and outside of his political life."Representative Lee, may I ask you a question?"James knew that voice. It was the voice of General Nathan B. Forrest, his best cavalry officer in the Army of Northern Kentucky. A man that did not agree with James's view over slavery and joined the Nattionalist Party as a Representative of the House to Tennessee. James always saw him a brother that was everything but blood. Now, he was a traitorâ¦ a person that became a Brutus and stabbed him in the back. James slowly looked up at the Former General that was under his command."What is your opinion towards the negros? Do you want their freedom because you think of them as equal to a white man?" he said in a voice that he gave a hint of the cat who caught the mouse.James knew that Forrest asked that question to gain more opposition against him, but he was not going to lie; however he was not going to give every detail. The press would publish it in every newspaper from here to San Diego."My opinion of the Blacks are that way because of their service to the Confederacy during the War of Independence; especially in the African Corps. They could have run away and not come back, but they did not. Instead, they stayed until the end. So, this is a reward for their service." He replied in a quiet voice, while not saying anything about equality.The people in his party clapped as was the people in the crowd above. Forrest and the other members of the Nationalist Party were not happy. In fact, some began calling to the Speaker of the House that James was not answering the question directly. The yelling continued until the Speaker slammed his gravel to the stand."Order in this session. Order in this session. Now, Representative Lee answered the question with sincere honesty and to the point of the question. I think that unless anyone else has any reason to continue this session for today, then I call for it to be adjourned for the day."James had to give to it to Old Jim Kemper from his Army, he could make a good person in politics. He knew how to get a crowd of children to calm down. Although, officially, he was not in any party at all; he tend to lend towards the Confederalists. He even had friendly talks with him about other people that were in his Army. Everyone agreed to call for an adjournment for the day as James slowly walked out as he knew that he was in for a busy day. The new Presidential election was coming and for his party; they nominated his father, Robert E. Lee to be the second President of the Confederacy and Judah P. Benjamin as Vice-president. The Whitesheets, a nickname because of their affiliate members in the Knights of Golden Circle who wore white sheets as they burned crosses and talked about white power, or the Nationalist Party nominated Alexander Stephens as President and Forrest as Vice-president.So far, James could tell that people wanted to vote for his father. However, he wanted to make sure that they do. So, he had his father make promises to the people that Stephens never held as Vice-president. He even told the press of how the advantages of electing his father outweighed electing Stephens as President.It was then he decided to host an event in Maryland to ensure he gets the state's votes on the ballot for his father. So he chose to have a play be held and it would be free for everyone with no tickets to be paid. The play would be held at Ford's Theater, it would start at night and would provide good entertainment to the audience. However, before it begins, his father would hold a speech. Then after the play, a dinner would be served at a mansion outside of town. It would put Stephens in shame for not hosting an event like this; as he could do more than James at this level but was not willing to fork over that amount of money. James will admit, this was expensive. It came out of his pocket and other politicians in his Party. However, the benefits would be worth more than the total price.James smiled as he knew that he would be attending the event with not only his father but also his big sister Mary Curtis. He missed his all of his siblings and now with the war won; everything was back to normal. However, it changed as his little sister Anne died of thyroid fever on October 1862. James mourned her loss and was never the same as she was his favorite sister. The one he had played with the most in during his childhood and now with her gone, he felt like a part of him was missing. He told his parents that should he ever die young to bury him next to his little sister.After a week, he continued to live on and shape up the Confederate Army to be a more permeant army. As the Army that he had commanded were more of a provisional one. He worked this project until he turned it over to General Jackson after leaving to politics. James still missed being a part of the army, but now he had other duties to attend to in the name of Virginia.The White HouseWashington, D.C., C.S.A.Office of the Vice-President"Now, do you remember the plan?" Alexander Stephens asked the man in front of him."Yes, sir. All I have to do is shoot Lee as the play happens and then run out to escape to Pennsylvania; while you create proof that shows Lee planning to make the C.S.A. into a country ruled by a dictator with his father as a helper." The man responded."Splendid, Agent. Now, what kind of gun are you going to use?""This!" The man replied pulling out a small one-shot derringer."Please tell me your joking, right! Because it will take more than just that to not only kill Lee but to get across the border up North." Stephens exclaim pinching his nose as he then continued."You know what take this, Agent. This should do the job, I would recommend you use the shotgun part of it to kill Lee. However, remember that you have to change the cock which will set it back to firing regular bullets."He pulled out a LeMat revolver, which fired larger bullets than a regular pistol could as well as a 20 gage barrel that can be used as a mini shotgun.Stephens then said with a stern voice, "Now, remember you must not be caught or arrest as it would lead to me being arrested. If you succeed and get across the border, I will see to it that you are rewarded in gold when I win the election. I promise you that.""Yes, Mr. Vice-President."Although, The Agent could care less about the gold. His reward will know that the South will be a pure white nation after the death of the brat Lee. The South must remain all white. No colors."Good, you are dismissed. Also, know this, if you get caught as well as imprisoned, you and I never saw each other.""Understandable.""Good Luck, Secret Agent Booth. Your services for this nation and this agency will not be forgotten."The Agent John Wilkes Booth nodded as he walked out placing the LeMat Revolver in his jacket pocket. Ready to be used for his greatest mission.Ford's Theater7:30 P.M."Do you think Dad is already there?" Mary asked James, as rode the couch to the Theater."I think that he is probably already half-way done with his speech. Meaning that he will still talk like the old man, he is today." James joked, where a fine suit that made look like a Politician.Mary giggled as she said, "You never change, James."James smiled."You still miss her, don't you?"James nodded with a frown.Mary nodded as well as while saying, "I think that we all miss Anne and that she misses us up in Heaven with God. James, you know that people do not live forever. So, you need to understand that it is alright to miss her, but do not let it control you. You have a great career and will earn so much more. She would want you to move on and make her proud. Alright?"James nodded as the coach came to a stop right beside the theater. James could see that his father must have finished earlier than expected and let everyone in the building. Slowly he opened the door and walked out, as he held Mary's hand to assist her out of the couch. He could not help but not how beautiful she looked in the red cotton dress that she was wearing. It displayed her beauty like a flag.He grabbed her hand like gentlemen as he walked her inside the theater. Just as they walked in, James made sure that he had his 1851 Navy Revolver on him. His father always told him to have a gun on in case he needs to protect the lady his escorting. He checked his pants pocket and felt the hard metal that had a cartridge filled with bullets that were ready to be used. James then continued leading his Sister upstairs to a large booth that showed a good view of the play that was going to begin. James noticed that the soon to be ex-President Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina were in the booth as well.James and Mary did not mind at all as they sat next to the two."So James, how did the members of the House react to your bill today?" Davis asked."The Whitesheets were screaming and yelling like a bunch of children. I think I need to try harder to get the public on my side, sir. " James answered."Well, that should not be a problem with you, James. The people love you. They see you as the next George Washington. They will always listen to anything you say."James nodded, as he began to think about Falmouth. The sin that is filled with blood. He never did forgive himself for it and wonder what the future will say about him. He knew that most likely the future will only remember the good and not the bad. He also wondered about his darkest secret. The fact that he is younger than he looks. Hell, He is not even old enough to be in Congress. But here he is a Representative and former Army General with a good history. He wondered how long he can continue with this secret. What will happen once people know about it? He was concerned.He looked around the theater for his father as he could not see him anywhere. He grew concerned as he wondered where he could be. He turned to Jefferson and asked him."Oh, I think he said that he went to go check on your mother back at a nearby hotel. But he will be back shortly." Jefferson responded.James nodded. As he saw the actors of the play come up on stage to present themselves to the audience."Before we begin our performance, there is someone we would thank for giving us the honor of presenting this play to you ladies and gentlemen." Said a male actor, as he turned towards James. He then continued by saying "Thank you, Mr. Lee. And welcome."Everyone in the room clapped at the mention of James's name. James smiled as Mary told him to stand up and say something. James nodded.Slowly he stood and began his impromptu speech, "Thank You, sir. Also, I would like to thank everyone here for coming. I hope you had enjoyed my father's speech earlier. I would like to apologize for missing it, as I had to attend to some very important matters. However, I am glad to be here with you all today on this fine night. Another thing, I would remind you that there will be a free dinner over at the White House; curiosity of President himself. Then after that I would be presenting my own speech over the recent bill that I have presented to the House. I wish everyone a goodnight as we watch the play."The audience and the actors clapped as the play began. James loved plays. He would always go to theaters to see plays. Some of his favorite were Julius Caser, Romeo and Juliet, and the one being played now Our American Cousin. The play was still new, created in New York in 1858. James much to see a play of it in Richmond a week before John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry. He had missed going to plays ever since the start of the war.He listened to the play as it brought him back to the feeling of happiness. A feeling that he did not have since the loss of Anne. The lines coming from the actors were enjoyable and James laughed along with the audience.Outside the booth that James was sitting at as he watched the ongoing play, John Wilkes Booth peeped through the keyhole to see his target inside: Harry James Lee. The man that desired to end slavery throughout the south. The man that could have been another Lincoln. A man that would dominate the South like a true Julius Cesar in the Roman Empire. A man that needs to die or else the South will die with the contamination of negroes through the nation. The southern way of life must be preserved or else the country will fall into anarchy. He is determined to kill Lee, no matter the cost.He kept thinking, "Lee must die! Lee must die! Lee must die! LEE MUST DIE!"He listened to the play. Waiting for the right moment to strike. He knew the play by heart like many other acts that he did in his career as an actor before joining the Confederate Secret Service. He helped bring in funds from Canada into the Confederacy to help fund the War of Independence. He serviced in missions of gathering information up north for the South while doing his career as an actor, this provided a good cover for him. John had a beautiful love that he would join up north and maybe he would be back with her after killing Lee. He pulled the cock of the revolver where it would fire the 20 gage round in it.He put his ear to the door waiting for the line that would have the entire crowd laughing, which would provide a good barrier against the sound of the 20 gage round being fired at Lee. He then heard the beginning of the line that had the funny word " sockdologizing old man-trap." This was it the moment of no turning back. Slowly, he opened the door to see if he had the element of surprise. Then he saw James Lee stand from his seat as he said "Dad?"As James fully turned around and saw the eyes of John Wilkes Booth pointing a gun at him; All that James heard was the loud bang of the 20 gage barrel and then pain all over his chest. James felt pieces of metal enter his body at the force that caused him to fall over the railing of the booth; while failing into the stage in front of the audience. He landed onto the wooden stage with a loud thumb; while the everyone in the audience was screaming at the site before them. As the actors did not know what to do or even what was happening.James tried to stand as he heard the yelling of "Sic Semper Tyrannis" He could not stand as he felt very weak with the blood flowing out of his body and onto the wooden floor. He heard the screaming of Mary and Varina up on the booth as he could barely see Jefferson stand while trying to attack John Booth. This proved to be futile as Booth pulled out a dagger and stabbed the President on the shoulder while knocking him down to the floor. James knew that Booth's only escape route was through back stage and that meant that he would have to jump down. Slowly James pulled out his Navy Revolver and cocked, where it was ready to be used and fired. He watched as Booth jumped off.James noticed the way that he landed on his leg. It would most likely result in it being broken. That gave him an idea of where to shoot him.He watched as Booth held up the dagger to the crowd as he yelled "Long Live the South!"As he ran past James thinking that he managed to kill him. However, James quickly aimed his pistol right at Booth's broken leg and fired. He could see that the bullet had hit its target, as he could see the bone to the man's leg and the blood coming out of it. Booth fell to the ground in extreme pain as he scream like a hollowing dog. He turned to James in shock to see him still alive. Quickly he pulled out the LeMat revolver and pulled the trigger. All that was heard was a click, as it turned out that Booth forgot to change the revolver to fire its cartridge rounds.James responded by firing at a rope holding a sandbag. It turned out to be a bulls eye as the rope snapped and then the bag of sand fell right on top of Booth, knocking him out cold. James smiled weakly as he heard the sweet sound of Mary's voice calling for him.As he saw her face, he weakly said "Mary, I think that I am dying... If that is true, then I get to be with Anne."And then he saw nothing but darkness.Mary went up to James as he closed his eyes. She wept as she heard his words to her. As she yelled for a doctor.She saw Jefferson come with a garrison of soldiers, who gathered a stretcher to carry James to a doctor.She watched as Jefferson pointed at Booth and said "Arrest that man and find out everything that you can."A couple of soldiers pulled the bag off of Booth as they lifted him out without any care for his leg. She knew that he would not be getting any medical help until he talked. Then the remaining soldiers carefully carried James on to the stretcher as the crowd began to panic even more of what had recently happened. Mary began to cry as she still did not see James move or make a sound. She began to see the figure of her father in the crowd trying to find what had happened. Until he saw her, he immediately ran up to her and saw the look in her face. her face of sorrow. He asked what happened. She explained to every detail and action that occurred. Robert went into shock as he knew that he had to find his son."Mary, go to your mother and explain to her what happened. Then I want you to send a message to Richmond and your brothers to explain the same thing. The country needs to know the story. I will find your brother and have someone fetch you, alright?" Robert ordered.Mary hesitated a little until she nodded, while running to her mother.Meanwhile, in another theater not far from Ford's, Thomas Jackson and his beloved family were watching another play. Thomas really liked moving away from Virginia to serve as General-in-Chief of the Confederate Army, but he had only accepted it because of the fact he knew that he was the only gifted to run this position properly. It was a gift from the Lord that his beautiful Esposita agreed to move with him to Washington with their beautiful 5 year old daughter. He never really expected General James Lee would ever think of going to politics. However, he has always knew that he is a special person. He was one of his best students back at VMI. A student that saved not only the whole Confederacy, but most importantly Virginia. He was an example of Virginians fight hard to win a fight.Now, turned to a life of politics, James had new fights to win. Fights that are made through words in verbal and printed format. Thomas understood the stress that the life as a politician can be and that is one reason why he choose not to go that route as well. Soldering is something that will stay with for the rest of his life. He even proved that during his service in the Confederate War of Independence. With the war won, the South could finally rest as a Independent nation. A nation that sacrificed the lives of at least 190,000 good men for victory. It was the Lord will that it was that many and not 300,000 men or the destruction of the South including Virginia.Young Julian Laura Jackson came to him in a feeling that brought a wave of joy. He now has a second child. A child that is blood to him. He had always thought that he would never be blessed with such a gift from god and that the only person that he could consider as a son was James. James was always like a son that he had never had. As his first marriage ended with both his wife and their still born son died before him. He had never fully recovered from it and when that day came each year, he wept and James was there to cry with him as well as pray for them. When Julia came, James sent him a letter of congratulations and praise of having an additional sister in his family. Thomas smiled, as he remembered offering James the title as Julian's Godfather. He knew James was surprised as he showed it in the next letter he sent ,after the surrender of Hancock a few miles north of Falmouth, accepting the title with honor.Thomas stopped thinking as he saw that the play was immediately interrupted by the stage curtains being pulled, blocking the view of the ongoing play. He was wondering what was the reason for this? Did something happen? Or was it just an accident by faulty rope? He got his answer when a man came out of the stage in a clean suit. Thomas could not see his face clearly but he could that he was in shock. This concerned him even more. Something has indeed happened. He listened as he waited to hear the dreadful news."Congressmen Harry James Lee has been shot!" were the words that he and everyone else in the theater heard from the man.Chaos erupted as screams and tears were heard as well as felt through the building. Thomas went into shock. How could this have happened? Who would dare shot James? And why? Was James alright and breathing? He had to know. He had to know as he did not want to lose another child. He did not want to lose James. Not on his watch. Then he heard the man continued."James Lee has been shot by an assassin at Ford's Theater."Thomas then knew where to go. He immediately carried Julia to his wife Mary Anna and instructed her to head back to the house as well as lock the doors until he sent a company of troops to protect them. She nodded as she too was filled with tears about James. He had always treated her like a second mother back at VMI. Mary quickly ran to the coach that they had rode and Thomas told the driver to take her to their house and if not then the white house He nodded as he had the horses pull the coach quicker than an Army. While Thomas went up to the nearest horse and rode on to Ford's Theater.At a house not far from Ford's Theater, people began scurrying around to find the proper medical supplies to operate on James. As they knew that the metal shards on his chest had to be pulled out. Confederate Army Doctors were in the house as they began to prepare for the operation. Hoping that they can save the Congressmen and Hero of the Confederacy. Outside the house a large crowd of people were waiting outside to find out the latest news about Harry Lee. There were even people crying about what just happened earlier and some of them were people that had witnessed the assassination by the once loved John Booth. People were even damning Booth to hell as well as calling for his immediate execution for the crime that he committed.Meanwhile inside the house, President Jefferson Davis began to call for martial law for Maryland in order to find out if this was a plot to depose the Confederacy. He called for the people to remain calm as he was being batched for his shoulder wound. He even explained that the assassin has been caught and justice will be served as soon as more information was found out if others were involved in this conspiracy.However, Robert E Lee looked down upon his wounded and most likely dying son. His son, a southern hero and future savior of the world, was hurt and shot. He knew that he must send James back to where he came from, no longer could he stay here. It was now too risky. He talked with his wife, who had arrived as soon as Mary explained to her the situation. They agreed that soon James must be sent to the future, where he is needed. He has already completed his duty for this time period. Now, he has another duty to fulfill and it was a time where he was born in before he was sent by the grace of god from his real parents. The news would hurt James more than he already was but he knew that his son would understand. However, he must get the Confederacy to think that he is dead.He instructed Major Taylor to go to the magical Washington Alley and gather a couple of potions that would help in ensure that this plan would work. The potions he needed were the Draught of the Living Death and the Wiggenweld Potion. Tomorrow, after the operation was complete, he would give James a glass of water with a drop of the Draught of the Living Death. The potion would take effect in at least an hour and would put James in a death-like sleep. This would have everyone think that James is dead and then when they put him into a coffin, he would then give James the Wiggenweld potion to wake him from his sleep. He really did not want to do it, but he knew that he must. It is time for James to leave this world and travel back to the future. He noticed General Jackson walking into demanding to know where James from the guards. They explained to him that James was still being operated and that the Doctors need to be left alone, which had been ordered by the President. Jackson nodded as he saw Robert and asked about what exactly happened. Robert explained everything that had been told to him by Mary and Jefferson.Thomas nodded as he explained that James was never one to go down without having a shot back. Robert laughed as he agreed."Dad?'Robert turned to the calling and saw all of his children in front of him. They were all concerned and had tears in their eyes.Robert smiled and said "My children. Are all of you alright?"It was Robert Jr. who answer, " We're alright, Father. But what about James? Is he going to be alright?"Robert frowned as he said that he is not sure. He then knew that he had to tell his children the truth and it had to be now. He told that he wanted to talk to them about James in private. He casted a look to his Wife as she sat on her wheelchair while holding a piece of cloth on her face, soaking away the tears dripping down her face. She gave him a look that showed agreement to his decision. He nodded as he lead his children to a empty room upstairs, where he would tell a secret that he and their mother have been keeping for more than a decade. He was not even sure how they would take it.In the Kitchen, Confederate President Jefferson Davis read the witness report of the assassination attempt. Trying to find out what exactly could be the reason for Booth's attempt to kill James Lee. It did not make any sense, Lee was not a traitor in fact he is a hero. According to the report for what Booth said during the interrogation, Lee's only crime to the psycho was presenting a bill to end Slavery in 15 years from now. However, there was one thing that he could not understand was how Booth got a LeMat when only certain Officers in the Army and White House officials were allowed to buy them due to a shortage of attaining them."Mr. President?"Jefferson looked up at the officer that came from the War Department and asked, "What is it, soldier?""Mr. President, we have more information about Booth that we just discovered and you are not going to like it.""Well, what is it, soldier?" Jefferson responded, if it is going to hit hard then it must as well happen now than later."Booth is an Agent from the Secret Service." were the words that silently came out of the soldiers mouth.Jefferson went into shock as the information soaked in. He could not believe what he just heard. He feared if there were other agents that were turning traitor."Should I be worried that the Service should rebel?" he asked."No, sir. The service was not even a part of this, but they are even calling for the death of Booth in the worst way possible. we think that another person is involved in the plot. but we do not know who. And Booth is not talking, he will not say anything."Jefferson sighed as began thinking that he would never find out who else was involved. Then he remembered something about the LeMat."Soldier, We began numbering and recording who owns a LeMat ever since the end of the war correct?"The soldier nodded."Get me the records and have someone bring me that gun. We are going to find out who else is responsible for this crime against the South. Also, find out if Booth was ever in the White House recently. I want to begin a warrant to search for that person, he could being packing to flee up North. If anyone is withholding information arrest them for treason and I will deal them in my discretion."The soldier nodded as he gave a salute and left to deliver those orders.Jefferson smiled, maybe he will find bring justice to James and his family. It is what they deserve and need right now. Hell, even the people will want it right now or else riots will happen all over the South.A couple of hours later, the soldier came back with a few other people and a box filled with papers with the gun inside the box. He stood in front of the President as he placed the record and gun on the kitchen table."Mr. President, These people say that have seen Booth in the White House just this morning."Jefferson nodded and asked "Do we know who he was going to see?""Not exactly, but this one with the funny hat says he was in the hallway where the Vice-President 's office is." The soldier replied as he pointed to a man with a funny colorful hat.Jefferson looked at him and asked "is that true?"The man nodded.Jefferson did not know what to think. He did not want to believe that Alexander would do such a thing. However, his hatred against James was against in his mind. Alexander had the ideas that James was trying to destroy the southern way of life. He knew that he must be sure. Evidence is needed to make such an accusation. The records would tell. He pulled the gun out of the box and looked at the numbers on the barrel:4032He quickly pulled the records out of the box and looked for the one with Alexander's name on it. when he did Jefferson nearly had a heart attack as he saw the numbers beside Stephens's name.4032Jefferson closed his eyes in betrayal. He could not believe it and he did not want to believe it. He slowly opened his eyes and then he went into anger. Quickly, he grabbed the nearest cooking pot and threw it through the window in rage; breaking the glass into pieces. He almost grabbed another pot to throw until he heard the sweet and caring voice of his beautiful Varina."Jefferson?"Jefferson turned to the voice and saw that the love face of his wife standing with the frightened soldier and people. He walked up to her while her black hair was curled back and wearing a beautiful white dress. Slowly he fell into her arms as he wept. He wept like he had never done so before."Oh, Varina. My sweet Varina. I feel so broken. My friend Alexander is responsible for Lee's assassination and I do not know what to do."Varina understood her husband's pain and thought of what to do. Until she decided to give her opinion about it."Jefferson, I do not know what else to say. However, I think there is one thing you have to do and that is confront him. Confront him for his sins and bring Justice for the Lee Family. They need to know that the justice is brought to the monster that hurt their family."Jefferson nodded as he wiped the tears off his face and said with a smile, " My dear, you have always been there for me when I needed your advice. Your right, I will confront the bastard Stephens and bring him to justice. I want you to stay here while I am gone. Keep Mrs. Lee company and comfort her."Varina nodded as she said, "Yes, my love. But do hurry back.""I shall not be gone for no more than 2 hours at most." He said with a kiss to her lips.He turned to the soldier instructed that he will need the Attorney General here by the time he comes back. the soldier nodded as Jefferson exited the house and rode on a horse to the White House. Determined to arrest the man he thought of as a friend."So dad, let me get this straight for everyone. James is not really our brother by blood and was sent from the future by his real parents to be trained by you. His parents are literally magical and were killed by this dark lord who wants to rule the world, while enslaving non-magical people like us. Apparently, you are a squib; meaning that you were born from a magical parents but without any magic." Rooney also known as William summarized.Robert nodded."And you believe it is time for James to return to the time he came from. However, you are worried that his magic has not matured before he returns."Another nodded came from their father."Why did you and mom hide this from use right at the start?"Robert answered by explaining that he was afraid of what they will say ad think of James."Father, we would still love James no matter what he is and where he came from. We still love him." Mildred explained.Everyone nodded in agreement with her."How do you know if his magic is matured?" Rooney asked."He would have been glowing bright when it happened." Robert answered.Mildred gasped as she remembered a few weeks ago, she saw James in his office at the Capitol glowing like the sun for a seconds. She was there to visit James and see how he was doing. She was concerned about James after seeing that first hand. Quickly, she told Robert about it."I guess that it means that it is time to have James sent home. His true home in the future." Robert explained sadly.Everyone bowed down their heads."Dad, do you think that we will ever see James again?" Robert Jr asked in a low tone."Yes, we will be able to watch for him up in Heaven with the Lord."His children nodded as they felt it was time to go down stairs and think about what is going to happen.James felt weak. He felt really weak as he slowly opened his eyes. His chest hurt like crazy like as if something had stabbed him there over and over again. Then he remembered Booth had shot him at the theater. Then he remembered taking Booth down. He tried to get up but every time he tried to move his chest would hurt more. He realized that this prevented him from getting up. He decided to look around him to see where he was. The room was wooden with red paint. There was a window to his right with the sun shining bright. To his left was an old wooden door and a small table filled with flowers. He heard a voice began to speak in front of him."Relax, sir. You need to rest. The doctors were successful in operating on. You need to sleep."James knew that voice from anywhere. That voice was of the man that had been under his command since his time as General of both the Army of the Mississippi and then the Army of Northern Kentucky. It was General Jacob Tonks, Commander of the newly organized 1st Confederate Army; which had just returned from its expedition through Mexico."General Tonks, is that you?" he asked in order to make sure as he began to feel tired again."Yes, General Lee. It is me. But please I have told you to call me Jacob or Tonks, sir. I do not deserve the respect that you have through the war. When I heard what had happened to you, I requisitioned a train from South Carolina to get to you. Now, how do you feel right now, sir?" Tonks asked with concerned, while walking to James's right side."Tired and like as if a thousand needles had been pierced through my body." James answered."That is expected, sir. Those metal bits did a good amount of damage to your chest. The doctors think that it may have damage you body to the extent that it will have unable to stand up for a while. ""Where is Mary?""Your sister and family are outside talking with Mr. Davis about what happened. I must say that Mr. Stephens will have a lot to answer for; in fact I hope that he is sent to the gallows for his actions.""Stephens? You mean the Vice-President?" James asked confused a bit."Former Vice-President, sir. It turned out that this was planned by both Booth and Stephens. Booth did the act, but Stephens provided the gun and was trying to make your death as a excusable attempt; he was in the process of making you look like that there was a plan where you would rule the Confederacy as Dictator. They caught him with the false documents that he created. He was trying to have you killed for you were wanting to end Slavery and I guess the act that you had presented was the final straw as it was not well planned. Stephens forgot that every LeMat owned was recorded in the War Department as own High-ranking officers and government officials are allowed to own them. Right now, Your father is acting as Vice-president until the end of Mr. Davis's term as president. Oh sir, your bill went through Congress quicker than a mule. because as soon as news of death became known. They held a special session as people who believing that you were dead demanded the passing of the Bill as a way of remembrance. Only a few fools said No to passing and they are being harassed by the people of Washington everywhere they go. They now call your bill 'The James Lee Amendment'."James smiled as he said, "Anything else?""Well, Seeing that Stephens was Presidential Candidate for the Whitesheets. The whole country is killing anyone associated with them. Hell, Forrest resigned as congressmen this morning after saying yes to your bill and dropped out of the campaign in order to avoid being hit by the people. I mean sir, The people are wanting the heads of the Whitesheets and the Golden Circle. Last I heard, the citizens of Nashville were killing dozens of them in the streets. Some were even tarred and feathered. The Tennesseans were crying 'Remember Lee' as they were chasing the bastards all the way to the Yankee border. The entire country is crying out for your vengeance."James nodded as he felt even more weaker."Sir, are still alright? you look pale." Tonks asked concerned."I do not know. I think that I am still dying, Tonks. My body feels weak. I feel that I may soon float away to Heaven." James answered with sincere honesty."Here General, drink this. Its Whiskey. I know that you do not care for alcohol, but your father says that it will help you a lot." Tonks said, while pulling the top off a sliver flask.Slowly he put the flask to James's lips. James took small sips and as he tasted the liquor; which was really strong but sweet. He stopped drinking it after having a few swings. Tonks put the top back on the flask as it put on the table next to James."Tonks!""Yes, sir?""I need you to get some paper, ink, and a quill. I wish to leave a letter for the Confederacy to read in the case of my death."Tonks was surprised, but nodded as he pulled some paper out of his coat pocket and set it on the table. He grabbed a bottle of ink and quill that was placed on the table behind the flowers. He sat on the chair beside the table and was ready to write a letter that would go down in history. It was then that James started speaking. In the letter, he called for the end to the massacre to the Whitesheets. Stating that it was alright to hate, but it was a sin against god to murder them in cold blood. He continued to exclaiming that the Confederacy must remain friends with the Union or else the nation will fall into a bath of blood. He even explained that the Confederacy must treat the African-Americans well or else the country will fall into a world of dictators that will bring the country into anarchy. James then explained that he is not really the age that everyone believes him to be and that he is really 19 years old. This really put Tonks into shock as he continued writing.James then asked that the people not be angry at his parents for allowing him to make the decisions that he made as they were against. He apologized for all the trouble that his caused and wished for their forgiveness. Suddenly James began to feel sleepy, his eyes were getting heavy and his whole body was turning weak. He knew that he must finish his letter before he died. He began to explain that he wished that he had more time to serve for this great confederacy and see that it lives on. He began to end the letter with the Confederacy's motto " Deo Vindice." Then he fell into a death like sleep that was noticed, until Tonks asked if that was all. When he got no answer, he turned to the Former General of the Confederacy. There was no movement from him.Slowly, Tonks walked up to the young man and put his ear to mouth. There was no breathing. Just quietness. Tonks closed in his eyes. Tears began to form in his eyes as he knew that the youngest General in history was dead and being sent to heaven. He cried as he lost a friend and a great man. God had now welcomed Lee into his arms leaving others to mourn for him. Pulling out his pocket watch, he looked at the time. It was April 21st at 10:23 A.M. 2 minutes since Lee died giving his last message to delivered. Only it would be delivered to the whole country to hear.Slowly Jacob Tonks walked out of the room to tell everyone the sad news. There would be a lot of tears to be wept over the loss of a man like James.James woke up to the taste of a disgusting liquid going down his throat. It was so disgusting that he began trying to spit it out. He did not think that anything could be as disgusting to whatever the hell it was. As soon as the taste was gone, he noticed that Tonks was no longer in the room. Instead, it was his family with his father holding a vial in his hand. Everyone was dressed in black and just regular back, the kind of black one would see in funerals. James also noticed that he was dressed in a suit and it was not the one he was shot with. It was brand new and more expensive than the other one. He wondered what was going on. Was it all a dream?"Dad, where am I and why am I wearing this suit?" James asked.Robert smiled while saying "My son, there is so much that I have to explain to you. So, I ask that you listen before you ask me another question."James nodded as he was willing to listen to whatever his father had to say. Robert explained to James that he was put under a deep sleep to have everyone think that he is dead from the wounds that he suffered and that there is a society which exists filled with magic. Right now, they are dressed for his funeral where they would replace him with a rock transfigured to look like him. Apparently, he was not from this time and that they are not his real family. His real parents sent him to the past in order to have ready for his destiny and his real name is Harry James Potter. James did not know how to react to this, it was like hearing that hearing that everything that he knew was a lie. Robert explained that no matter what they still love him as their son and that he must understand that he must return home in order to defeat this supposed dark lord. if he did not then Virginia would be lost to this monster. James nodded as he cared for his home state. He knew that he must defend Virginia, no matter what the threat is and he will fight to the end."Alright, Father, I understand." James said."Good, now before I hand you the item that will take you home; why don't you say goodbye to your brothers and sisters." he said.James nodded as he went over to his siblings and hugged them to death; exclaiming that he will miss them and will not forget them. He went over to his mother and saw that she tears in her eyes."Mom, please, don't cry. We'll see each other again in heaven, I promise you that." James said with a comforting voice.His mother looked up and said in a loving voice, "I know, but it is just that I am again sending my little man off to fight another war. Promise me that you will be careful, alright James?"James nodded as she smiled at him, "I promise mother."He turned to his father and stated that he was ready to begin his journey. Robert handed him a golden necklace with a red jewel in the center. James touched the jewel, it was warm and hard. He still could not believe everything that was going on. He still felt that it was still a dream but he knew that the sensations that he was having are real."Son, before you leave, I would like to give you this suitcase. I got it from a friend. The insides are larger than they appear. In it I put some of your things inside, like your Navy Revolver and the uniform that you wore during the war." His father said, handing him a small black suitcase."Thank you, father." James said holding the suit case tightly, not sure how the transportation to the future would work."Now, all you have to do is say these words 'there is no place like home'." His father explained."Alright." James said with a hint of uncertainty. Slowly he said those words and suddenly, he began to see that everything was spinning around him. His body was getting dizzy, he did not know how much more he could take. The jewel was glowing brighter and brighter until it covered his sight, where all that he saw was red. James kept praying for it to be over as he closed eyes. His ears only heard a loud ringing that was deafening. The whole thing must have lasted for only a few minutes, because it slowly began to stop and then came a voice. There was strange about this voice. It did not actually sound human."Young Master Potter is back. Masters returned."Slowly James opened his eyes and saw his surroundings. One thing was certain, he was not in Washington anymore. He was not even in the same house that he came from. Everything around him was different.Finally, we are done with the past and now we are in the future. It has been an experience to do the past chapters and now I cannot wait to do the next chapter. However, I have Finals to be ready for and the GRE to study for during the winter; as I want to get into the BA-MA fast-track program for History. Now, let me give some information about some things that are new from this Chapter. Basically, it is a history lesson. Because some of this I just learned and knew that I had to add.The Knights of the Golden Circle was a secret society that wanted to expand the power of the slave states through the annexation of Mexico all the way to the upper portion of South America, with the Caribbean including. They were like the Klu Klux Klan of the Pre-Civil War America, only they did not do burning crosses that like the Klan did; I only added as I believed that a movement like that would still have happened even if the South had won the Civil War. When the Civil War began, their membership grew largely in the South to numbers that would never be matched. The society even had members in the north, but when the Civil war ended with the defeat of the South the Golden Circle fell as well. But today, there is theories stating that after the war people of the Circle tried to fund a Second Civil War. People like Jessie James robbed banks in order to attain the funds for the never coming war and the rest is history.Now on to why I had Booth do his assassination on James at Ford's Theater is because I believe that he was insane enough to want to kill anyone that wanted to end slavery or 'The Sothern Way of Life'. If he was psycho enough to kill Lincoln for ending Slavery and the Civil War with a Northern Victory, then I think that he is crazy enough to wanting to kill James especially when he present the bill that enlisted slaves into the Confederate Army. The bill that would end Slavery could be enough to drive Booth into the desire of killing James. There is the belief that Booth was a part of the Confederate Secret Service, which does more than just protect the President; they were like the Civil War version of the OSS during World War 2; however, there is not much proof showing that Booth was ever a part of it. Now, I am putting up a poll on my account for you to answer on the question on whether James should have a Harem or not. And if yes to a Harem, then how many women and who?The second poll will be available when the next chapter is uploaded. The maximum I will go to is 5 women. The names of girls to select will be put up on a different poll and is suitable to people who said yes to the first poll. You will be allowed to make only 3 choices on the second. If the second Poll is not pull by tonight, then it will be sometime next week and leave a temporary message to everyone know. After the poll is closed, I will choose the number that has been accepted in the first poll, if a Harem is allowed. I know that is kind of weird to have a second poll that can be cancelled if the answer to the first poll is no, but I like to do things at the same time. Plus I do not know when I will start on the next chapter, so this is there if It takes a while in the next chapter. Also, the polls will be up in my profile page.If there is anything that you do not understand from this chapter or the story, please let me know and I will answer the story in the next chapter. If there is a problem with the polls, please let me know; because this is my first time doing a poll on this account and I just learned how it works. If you would like to leave a review, then feel free to leave one. Until next time.

Disclaimer: I own nothing. I do not own Harry Potter nor Gods  Generals.PLEASE READ THE BLACK WORDING BEFORE GETTING TO THE STORY, IT HAS SOME INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.Hello, Everyone. I know that it has a little more than a month since I have last updated. However, after I had completed the fall semester, I was busy with two things. The first was looking for a new car to buy as I finally got my license and I am sure that some of you know hard it can be to the perfect can that one wants to buy. Second, I was on a much-needed vacation for a week and I somehow forgot to bring my laptop along with my flash drive with me on the trip. Now, I am able to bring my full attention to this story before the next semester starts on the 19th of January; where I will be very busy in getting the grades that I want.Also, I have decided to end the poll. The poll will determine whether or not James should have a Harem; if yes then how many. If the have you have already done it, then let me give some more information and I hope that I explaining correctly enough for people to understand. When counting the votes, I will add up all the yes's against the no's. Even though there are four different yes's on the number of women in his harem. Then the Yes section with the most votes will determine how many women will be in it. So, Basically, I am making this two polls into one. I like to make things easy for myself as I at times have a busy schedule. If anyone is feeling cheated about this, please let me know and we can try to work this out in any way possible. Information about the next poll will be displayed at the bottom along with the results of the recent survey that are now completed.Now enjoy the story and please leave a review.Potter Manor, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom2:00 P.M., June 15, 1993It has been four months since James arrived at the time that he had originally come from and now he still misses everyone at his old time. He lost his family, Jefferson Davis, The Jacksons, and little Julian. Oh, he would love to see them one more time. But the house elves of the manor helped in providing great company to James. They even made sure that he was up to date on the history of the world after he left his old time. He found that his own memoirs were published a month after his death. The first day that they were released, it became a best seller in the Americas and Europe. As everyone wanted to read the mind of the Confederacy's Napoleon. Every General looked to as a manual to learn tactics from the famous Child General. They are still selling as much as the Bible today. Right now, there are works of a miniseries being made with a very famous actor; which are based on his memoirs.After that, he learned that after he 'died,' his body was put in a coffin and traveled the whole Confederacy where people mourned the loss of their savior. Even World Leaders like Napoleon the Third, Queen Victoria, Czar Alexander The Second and even Former President Abraham Lincoln; who was quoted in saying that "Had the North won the War, I would have been the one in that coffin, not James Lee." Apparently many Historians do not that doubt one bit and even his rival Northern Generals came to see his body like Grant, Hancock as well as Sherman. The next year Sherman would die to his wounds from his famous charge that many re-enactments try to recreate.However, before Sherman died, he published his memoirs that showed his military career during the war and his capture after the charge. Another person that came to see his coffin was the former Dictator of Mexico Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna also known as the Napoleon of the West. Apparently, the new Emperor of Mexico that was backed by the French wanted someone who could deals with any rebels that would destroy his throne. Santa Anna fitted the bill, but it caused problems with both the Confederacy and the Union who agreed with Confederate Ambassador Sam Houston that it would make them future targets should be the Demon of the Alamo and Goliad gain power in Mexico. The Confederacy managed to negotiate a treaty with the Union stating that should the Empire of Mexico ever attack either one of them then both nations will declare war on Mexico. As they would both send units to fight a common enemy. Meaning that the two countries are now allied with each other a year after he died and 4 years after Independence; now that is efficiency. To say, James was proud of his nation, they had followed through one of his first wishes.After a month of traveling, His coffin was sent to Richmond to be buried in a tomb where his little sister would be a move to as well. Jefferson Davis wanted to ensure that his wishes were followed. The tomb was completely made out of marble and many people came to his 'final resting place' to say goodbye. However, while that was happening many of his opponent politicians were trying to reverse the laws that he passed and presented to Congress; they were even attempting to get the Supreme Court in on this. When the people found out about this, it caused a rebellion that even Soldiers in the armies and militias took part in. They violently beat them up as they tarred and feathered them, some of them were even shot to death. The French Ambassador to the Confederacy compared it to the French Revolution in 1789, only there were no guillotines used to chop heads. The Supreme Court not wanting to be next in the lie of sight declared that while it is true, James was underage to be a Congressmen, there is no official procedure in how this problem should be solved. They decided that no action will be made against it but for future cases like this, the move will be done. After the 1867 election, His father was made the second President of the Confederacy with all the states along with Judah P. Benjamin as Vice-President. Then on 1870, the French Empire fell in a humiliating war against the Prussia and the other German States; where the Empire fell and France lost Alsace-Lorraine to the recently unified German Empire. In its place, the French Empire was replaced with a Republic.As time went, the First World War came in 1914. Both the Union and Confederacy declared neutrality as they did not wish to get involved in a European War that does not concern them. That belief changed as 118 Americans from both nations were killed in Sinking of the Lusitania on May 7, 1915. The two nations were outraged but still decided to stay neutral in the war; while still trading more goods with the Allied nations against the Imperial Germans and their allies. Even James could tell that the goal that the current President of the Confederacy Woodrow Wilson had of staying neutral was not going to work. One could hope for it, but James could sense the conflict in Europe was so intense for it expand to another continent. Then came the surprise from around the world in January 1916, something that Germany built that they believed would keep both American nations busy. They created an alliance with Mexican Empire, which had expanded all the way to Panama. The Mexican Emperor Manuel The First with his top General named Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna the Second were promised that in return for the alliance, they would get all the land that they lost from the Mexican-American War in 1846. The offer was something the Emperor desire and ordered an Invasion into the Confederacy through Texas, New Mexico, and California. This lead to both nations declaring war on Mexico and Germany, as the offer was discovered through a telegram that the British decoded, which was for the Germany Ambassador in Mexico to send the Emperor.At first, the Mexicans were making greater pushes into the Confederacy as they occupied Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, as well as Confederate and Yankee California. However, all that changed at the Battle of Beaumont or the Texan Golden Triangle as it more referred to; where both Union and Confederate Troops were entrench around the cities of Beaumont, Nederland, and Port Arthur. As the Mexicans were advancing after burning and sacking the cities of Austin and Houston for revenge both the war and Texan Revolution. The battle lasted for more than two months until the Mexican General Santa Anna the Second became impatient as the Mexican Navy was destroyed by both American Navies off the Floridian and Confederate Cuban coast. He ordered gas attacks on the Americans and a Full on the charge on all flanks. However, it became their downfall as the Americans had deployed their newest weapon from the British and French called the Tank; which was highly recommended by James's old friend Jacob Tonks, who was General-in-Chief of the Confederate Army at the time and the Seventh President of the Confederacy in 1898 - 1904.At the Battle of the Texan Golden Triangle, the Mexican forces were turned back at the cost of losing the manpower to help defend their occupied lands. Historians called the battle as the turning point of the war's American theater. As it started a chain reaction where the Americans gained an increase in morale, where they would attack hard for revenge over Austin and Houston; especially after hearing the news that Santa Anna killed all the men who tried to defend Austin and surrendered before the Battle of Beaumont to be executed. This brought out the battle cry "Remember Austin" among the Confederate Troops as they charge the Mexican Troops, particularly at 2nd Battle of Houston; where it is compared to the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, only this comparison the captured Santa Anna the Second was killed by Confederate Forces.However, by December of 1917, the Mexicans were pushed out of the Confederacy and were retreating to ground to better fortify their positions. At the same time, the Mexicans faced another problem. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Columbia joined in the war on the American side. This forced the Mexican Emperor to divide his forces to fight two fronts at once. The action he made would result in the Confederate forces charging towards Mexico City to make significant breakthroughs in the Mexican lines; while the Union sent their troops to Europe to fight Germany. Although the Confederacy did send a small expeditionary force to help the Italians in reaching Bavaria. The war would finally end with Mexico Surrendering on February 18th, 1918, after losing its capital in a bloody three-week battle and Germany surrendering on October 21st. The final peace would come two years later after the signing of both the 2nd Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and Treaty of Versailles. The terms of both treaties were something that James believes is unfair and unjust, even for what happened in the war. While Mexico had to pay substantial reparations to both America's, form a new republican government, limit its armed forces, and give up parts of its land up north to the Confederacy; Germany, on the other hand, suffered worse. The Treaty of Versailles looked like it something planned right up to the start where other European nations were trying to eat up Germany or be the more dominate nation. Germany had to pay 20 times more reparations than Mexico, limit its Armed Forces even more than Mexico, admit responsibility for the war, and even give up some of its land in Africa as well as in Europe to the Allies.It disappointed James to know that his own party passed both treaties with a majority. His party signed a treaty that he knew who lead to another Great War, a war worse than the first. It turned out that he was not wrong as a man named Adolf Hitler used the problems that the treaty brought in Germany in his rise to power as Fuhrer. He start the Holocaust and start the Second World War. James knew that he was not wrong as the war had almost all of Europe under Nazi rule. The Confederacy and Union stayed neutral like last time; until suddenly on December 7, 1941, Japanese forces bombed Pearl Harbor damaging the Union Navy to extreme levels. It led to the Confederacy joining the war with the Union after the Japanese also bomb Dutch Harbor on the Confederate Territory of Alaska; which the Confederacy bought from Russia as the Union was still recovering from the war. A few days after the attacks, Hitler foolishly declared war on the American Nations. The war would be a bloody one as the Allied forces had to fight on two fronts at the same time. Eventually, Nazi Germany fell in May 1945 and on September Japan surrendered after the two Atomic bombing of Hiroshima as well as Nagasaki. When James saw footage of one of the bombings, he went into shock and fear. What he saw was a weapon that could bring the wrath of God, It was worst than what he did at Falmouth. At least, he did not blow up civilians. He also knew that without having to find out more that it would lead to the opening of a Pandora's Box.James stopped thinking about the history he missed and thought about the future. One of the elves had explained to him that he will have to go to the magical school Hogwarts, even though he is of age to do magic outside of school. He has to as it will help him control his magic better. Soon, He would even have to reveal himself to the entire wizarding world and deal with his big fame. As everyone in the Wizarding England knows that he is somewhere alive and are waiting for his return. However, as he waited for his letter; the elves taught as much about much as possible for him to skip a few years and graduate early. James really did not feel comfortable about the house elves, he felt that it was another version of slavery. He would have released them, but they explained to him that freedom was the worst that would happen to them as it would lead to their death. He knew that he had to accept it and not like it.When he received his letter yesterday, it was then he decided to go to this Diagon Alley and do his shopping for school. If the world is going to see him, he might as well do it now than later. Although, he was concerned about what kind of crowd that he was going to face; once he arrived. He thought about to bring his Navy revolver, in case if it was needed to defend himself. He doubted it, but he suspected he needed it at Ford's Theater until he was shot by Booth. So it was better safe than sorry. He grabbed his letter and read the supplies that he would need as a fourth-year student of the studies that his house elves gave him helped him advanced to a suitable level to not spend all 7 years at Hogwarts. Although, he knew that he would be most likely safe to a Muggle profession. Maybe he would go back to the Confederate Army if he can explain his case to the current Muggle President of the Confederacy. He wondered if he was actually born in the South if he were not then it did not matter. The reason to that is because he is a Southern and Virginian by heart. He will always be loyal to the land that he fought for during the War of Independence. The South is his heart and he will still defend it along with Virginia till his dying days.Slowly he went into the Manor's furnace and grab the Floo Powder in a jar nearby. He was still surprised that methods of transportation like this existed. This powder could transport him to any place that has a Floo connection. The world has changed or his world at least. Magic can be really strange to get used to at times. He quickly muttered "The Leaky Cauldron" and dropped the powder to the floor as the green flames engulfed him. Then suddenly the next thing he knew he was in a tavern filled people. People that were staring at him with looks of surprise and happiness. Looks that he got everywhere back in Richmond and Washington. He really did not like those looks.Then he saw nothing but lots of faces wanting to shake his for his fame in this time era. He still did not wish to believe that as he is sure that it took more than himself to take out a supposed Dark Lord. James did not know what to do, he did not want to be rude to these people; especially when they are grateful to him."Welcome, Mr. Potter! Welcome!" One man said with a cheerful."It is an honor to meet you, Mr. Potter. I cannot believe my eyes." one woman said."Mr. Potter, over here." a man with the funniest hat that he had ever seen.He began shaking hands as he tried to walk out of the tavern and into the shopping area that he was attempting to get towards. However, these people had no kindness or demand as everyone wanted to see him and shake him. He was no sure if he would be able to get out until he heard a loud yelling. The yelling was in a sweet female voice that sounded like heaven to him. He wondered who was the owner of that view of an angel that came to save from these people."Alright everyone, break it up, everyone. Break it up. I am sure Mr. Potter has some shopping for school to do. So leave him or else there is going to be some trouble."James looked to the owner of the beautiful voice and saw a face. A face with the shape of a heart, eyes with the color of purple that did not stop him from wanting to look into them, her body was one of a Greek goddess, and her clothing was one that matched with her beauty. She wore a red robe that was tight around her body. James felt that he stand in front of a woman that is more beautiful than a Southern Belle during his time before, during and after the war. She was a woman that spoke nothing more the sounds of beauty as he realized that she began to talk to him. He quickly shook his head as he started to listen to what she was saying to him while everyone in the crowd was calming down a little bit."How about I show you how to get to Diagon Alley from here, Mr. Potter? Before everyone in this place begins to go crazy again," she said with her sweet voice.James did nothing but nodded as he could not trust himself to talk. He did not want to have her think that he was one of those perverts that had existed in his time and now. He listened as she began to take his hand and lead him towards the entrance of Diagon Alley. Slowly they came up to the door and James noticed that it was blocked by the brick wall. Then she tapped a few of the bricks, when in a speed of a flash the bricks of the wall began to move creating an entrance to enter the Alley. The Alley itself was busy with people, there were shops and stalls with many different items. James recognized some of the items from his studying with the Manor's elves."I know it is an excellent place to be. I remember when I came here on my first as a child. "The woman of beauty said.James nodded as then he realized that he never knew of her name. It was rude to with a lady without knowing her name."Excuse, I am sorry. But I never got your name." James said in the kindest voice that he could produce.The woman frowned, at first, he feared that he somehow upset her. He was about to apologize to her."OK, but please do not say aloud near anyone please," She said.James nodded."Tonks. Nymphadora Tonks. But only call me Tonks out in public." She said with a blush.James went into surprised. However, it was not of her first name; but her last name. It was the same last name of his best friend of the South, Jacob Tonks."Um...Forgive for asking, are you by any chance related to a General Jacob Tonks in the Confederate War of Independence?" James asked silently.Tonks looked at him for a second in surprise as well."Yes, he was my great -great Grandfather. One of his sons moved to England after the Spanish-Confederate War after marrying the daughter of an English Noble. "She explained.James nodded as he remembered reading about the Spanish-Confederate War. It was a war that lasted literally for three months. The war was fought over the control of Cuba, which its people was rebelling for Independence against the ruling Spanish. It started with the Battleship C.S.S. Texas blowing up in the Havana Harbor. His friend and President at the time was recently elected, the president before him signed the Nation into War. Forcing Tonks to lead the country into a war that he had not even called the nation to get involved. The Spanish surrendered after losing control of Cuba and the Philippines. Jacob negotiated peace with the Spanish, ensuring that the terms were fair. The terms of the Treaty of Paris stated that the Confederacy would annex Cuba along with other islands in the Caribbean and that the Philippines would become a free nation under the protection of the Confederacy. In exchange for Cuba, The Confederacy would pay Spain about five million dollars. The treaty would be ratified by the Confederate Senate with the needed two-thirds majority. James could say that he was very proud of the hard work that General Tonks has done for the Confederacy; even after his own 'death.'"Why did you ask?" Tonks asked with a beautiful look on her face that showed curiosity.James knew that he had to come up with a quick answer to her question. He knew that he could not tell her the truth, she will never believe it. He had to lie to her. He did not like to people, but he knew that he has no choice to. Even with this situation."Well, I remembered reading a book about him." James lied with a small fake smile on his face. He hoped that she bought it.She nodded as she continued, "do you need to go to Gringotts? So that way you can collect the money need to purchase your supplies."James nodded as he remembered Jacky, the main house elf of the manor, explained how the Wizarding World works. She told him as much as he needed to know and handed him over the keys to his vault at the bank. She also reminded him to find out about his current finances in the bank; as he will be responsible for that as Head of the Potter House. Then he decided to ask Tonks another question; one that just came to his mind."Hey, Tonks. I was wondering what exactly your profession is?"Tonks happily answered that by saying "Well, Mr. Potter, I am an Auror. Basically a dark wizard catcher and magical policemen. However, when it was discovered that you are still alive and will go to Hogwarts soon; the Auror Department felt that it was best that I become your personal bodyguard. As they felt that you were in need of reliable protection. I am sorry for not telling you this when we meet earlier, but it slipped from my mind that I had to say you."James nodded as he felt like that he did not need a bodyguard to watch and protect him. Sure, he was caught off guard by Booth shooting; but he got his payback when he shoot his leg. The damage done to it was enough where Booth's leg was cut off with nothing to sooth the pain during the process. Leading to him to literally die from all that pain and screaming the day after he 'died.' James really did not feel sorry for Booth at all upon hearing the history of it. Alexander Stephens, on the other hand, was put to death by firing squad on the charges of Treason, Conspiracy, Murder of James Lee, and Attempted Murder on Jefferson Davis. Davis did not even attend Stephens's execution, as he made to reforms in the Confederate Secret Service after it was discovered that Booth was an agent of the branch. The branch had to face a public relations nightmare as they were trying to make a good face to the public. Eventually, it was decided that new restrictions would place on the branch, which would limit their abilities on politics and other things. Over time, they were able to get a good face from the public during the First World War or more important the 2nd Mexican-American War; where they did secret missions that helped in turning the tide against the Imperial Mexican Army and Navy.When he walked into the large bank, he noticed that the place is run by the goblins. James really did not feel relaxed about this fact as these creatures looked like little green devils that cared nothing more than money. He thought that this thing should be kinder to people. However, he knew that was a long shot. He walked up to the main counter in front of him and greeted himself as the gentlemen to the Goblin; who was busy counting gold coins. James waited until his attention was on him. He waited for about five minutes until the goblin noticed that he was there."Yes?" he asked with a growl."Yes, sir. I am here to check on my inheritance and make a withdraw. My name is Harry Potter." James answered with a smile; as he handed him his keys to the vaults."Very well, but your companion will have to wait outside until we are done with you." The Goblin exclaimed.James nodded as Tonks told him that she will wait outside of the bank for him."Follow me, please." The Goblin ordered.Slowly James followed the Goblin to the table that had a little tiny golden needle. James wondered why that would be there. It seemed odd for that to be on a table or even in a bank, especially since it is not holding any papers."Please put a finger on the needle, so that way we can collect a tiny drop of your blood. This is to determine that you are Harry Potter." The Goblin explained with a smile. Most likely hoping that he is a fraud.James nodded as he did it quicker than a Cavalrymen. Putting his thumb on it as he felt a tiny bit of the metal inside his finger. There was not much pain as he pulled it out at a slow rate. He looked at the Goblin wondering what was going to happen next. The goblin then told James to wait here, while he collects the records of his inheritance.James began to think more about the History of the Confederacy since his 'death.' He understood that after the Second World War, the idea of Communism grew and began the Cold War. James shuddered at the knowledge about the supposed War of Words. Basically, the war starts with the Soviet Union building their own Atomic Bomb after the Confederacy and Union dropped them on Japan. Then it intensified as the Soviets became successful in making one and the Americans building other Nuclear Weapons that can destroy a city. The two sides were literally pointing missiles of each other and people were fearful of a Third World War was coming; which would destroy civilization on the Earth. James could say that he is glad that the Soviet Union fell in 1991. The thought of Nuclear Apologise was scary to James, especially where it is worst than his sins in Falmouth. This event proved his theory to be right' of how as each era and war comes as well as goes, warfare goes into a new step whether it is big or small. The Second World War brought warfare to what he believed a level that would never climb up to another ever again. With Nuclear Weapons as weapons that can end wars in just seconds after being declared.James remembered watching a film on what a nuclear war would look like. He shuddered at the movie as it was realistic to him; he did not even want to get a start on those Horror films that this generation is creating. That is why he stays on books, books may give the head an imagination, but it will not give out these jump scares; where the death of the character by a demon is showed to where the monster is popping out to the direction of the viewer. He did not like all films of this time, just the horror ones. He did enjoy the documentaries from the Historical Channel on his television. It provided him with enough information in helping him understand the current world and years that he missed. He was addicted to the channel, as he wanted to learn more from. He even learn about things during the American Revolution that he did not already know about. James felt that this was a place that he did not want to leave ever again. He went sadly as remembered his old Family and parent, who are now already dead now of age. They were his true family while he is grateful to his Birth Family. There was always that love he had that deeper family that raised him in Virginia. James wished he could see them one more time. One last time to see his brothers, sisters, and parents. However, he knew that he was out of luck. God has other plans for him that he must follow.It was then the Goblin return with some papers in his hands. He walked up to him and gave to James. Slowly James looked at the statistics in the papers carefully, like he did when reading reports during the Confederate War of Independence.Inheritance of Harry James Potter-LeePlace of Birth: James Lee Hospital, Richmond, Virginia, C.S.A.Date of Birth: July 31, 1981Birth Parents: James Charles Potter (Father) and Lily Laura Potter nee Evans (Mother)Adopted Parents: Robert Edward Lee (Father) and Mary Ann Lee nee Curtis (Mother)Houses: Washington (Muggle and Magical) [By Transfer] Potter (Magical) [By Blood] Gryffindor (Magical) [By Blood] Curtis (Muggle) [By Transfer] Lee (Muggle and Magical) [By Transfer] Slytherin (Magical) [By Conquest] Ravenclaw (Magical) [By Blood] Pendragon (Magical) [By Blood] Black (Magical) [By Blood] Evans (Muggle) [By Blood]Finances:Washington (10.4 million Galleons [Equivalent in total from both accounts])Potter (140.8 million Galleons)Gryffindor (1.9 billion Galleons)Curtis (25.3 million Galleons [Equivalent in total from both accounts])Lee (12.5 Million Galleons [Equivalent in total from both accounts])Slytherin (1.4 billion Galleons)Ravenclaw (1.6 billion Galleons)Pendragon (3.7 Billion Galleons)Black (263.5 Million Galleons) Evans (75,418 Galleons [Equivalent in from Muggle Currency])Total: 10,026,978,831.28 GalleonsInvestments: Dixie Jewels 79% (Potter)Sony 52% (Potter)Diagon Ally 81% (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Black)Saint Mungo's 50% (Ravenclaw, Potter, Black)Richmond Motor Co. 42% (Potter)Washington Ally 100% (Washington and Lee)Confederate Sweets and Wine 63% (Potter and Lee)Confederate Air Lines 92% (Potter)Cunard Line 58% (Potter)Confederate Cruise and Shipping Lines 43% (Lee and Curtis)Nimbus Racing Broom Company 74% (Potter and Black)Microsoft 40 % (Potter)Welsh Steel and Welding Co. 72 % (Potter and Evans)Grunnings Drill Co. 100% (Evans)Properties:  Potter Manor, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom  Number 12 Grimmauld Place, London, England, United Kingdom Lee Manor, Arlington, Virginia, C.S.A.

Potter Villa, Nevers, France Camelot, Scotland, United Kingdom Potter Island, Caribbean Sea, Near CubaJames nearly lost his eyeballs after seeing his inheritance. He is rich. Richer than any man that he had ever known in his time. He could buy the entire Confederacy if he wanted. James wondered why he had control of his adopted family's finances. Not that he had a problem with that, but it was something that he could not get out of his mind. That was until the Goblin handed him a letter in the crest of the Lee Family. He knew exactly who that is from then. Slowly he broke the seal and opened the letter as he started reading it.My dear Son,By the time you are reading this, then you have successfully made it to your original time. This also means that I, your mother, and siblings are long dead by age. I ask that you do not cry for this fact as we have served the Confederacy until our dying day and are now serving the Holy Father in Heaven. Know this we will be with you in every step you take, as your mother says that she still wants to find the woman who will actually controls that thing you have of dying for other people; even if you will not see her there at the wedding. Now you are probably wondering why you have full control of the Lee, Washington, and Curtis finances. Well, I and everyone else thought that you have deserved it for your services to Virginia. We all are very proud of you. We wish you the best in your new life in the future. Although some of us like Rob is jealous of you for your ability to travel into the future. James, I will admit you have always been my favorite son. You have made me a proud old man. I wish you luck in your quest to protect Virginia and the Confederacy from the evils of Lord Voldemort. I hope you find happiness in your new life in the future. Your loving Father in the Past,Robert E. LeePresident of the Confederate StatesJames has a few tears in his eyes. As he started to miss his family even more. He wished that he did not have to leave them. However, he knew that he has a duty to fulfill. A destiny of sort. A destiny to protect the love that he loves in the new world. He must fight for Virginia and the Confederacy. He slowly followed the Goblin to one of his family vaults to make a withdraw for his school shopping.An Hour Later, Outside GringottsAs Tonks waited for Harry to come to the bank, she began to think of what she thought of him. He was friendly and pleasant, unlike other men that she was within Hogwarts. He treated her with respect and she liked that about him because nobody in the Auror Department gave for her abilities and clumsiness. She felt welcomed by him and wished that there were more men like him. Though, she did like that Southern Accent he had on him. She still remembered playing with him when he was a baby and she was a little toddler. Making funny faces, that would get him laugh. She smiled as he remember how cute was a baby, now he is a handsome young man that has a great life ahead of him.When he walked out, she stood ready to show him around Diagon Ally and help collect his school supplies."So everything settled?" She asked."Yes, and I am ready to get this done," Harry said with a smile."Just follow me, Harry. I will show you around the area and help you get everything that you need.""Please call me James, a lot of my friends do.""Very well, James. I will lead you to the place to get your wand. That should be the first you need to get and most important.""Lead the way, my lady," James said with a sparkling smile.Tonks blushed as she led him to Ollivanders Wand Shop. The nicer he was becoming to her, the more she wished for a chance to be his real lady.After what seemed like hours, James was finally done shopping. The shopping was hell. First, the wand that he bought has the same core as the one that murdered his Birth Parents. Then he was surrounded again by people wanting to shake his hand at the bookstore. Luckily, all it took was Tonks to threatening to put everyone in Jail. Next, he found the most racist person he has ever seen since Stephens at the clothing shop. Tonks told him that was her cousin Draco Malfoy, apparently a spoiled brat from a wealthy family that gets away with everything. She meant that in a literal sense, as Malfoy's father was a Death Eater; who were followers of Voldemort. Lucius Malfoy managed to buy himself out of prison and make bribes protect himself. This showed James the stability and cleanness of the British Ministry of Magic. Tonks exclaimed that she is glad that her mother is disowned from his. James felt sorry to hear that, no one should disown their family for personal or racial reasons. Not even an angel like should be disowned. After all that trouble, James bought himself a snowy white owl that he had named Hedwig. She is one that James really likes. It was probably the right result that happened throughout this shopping experience he had today. He gave her that name after reading from one of his school books and thought for it to be an appropriate name for her.He was looking forward to watching more from the Historical Channel when he gets home. Then a nice warm shower after that. What he could say for sure is the future has improved the technology that was used in his time. The closest thing to a shower was either rain or pouring a bucket of water over oneself. He looked over to Tonks, his bodyguard."So, I guess that you have to go home to, right?" he asked her with a smile.She blushed as she answered with a small voice, "Actually, as a Ministry Bodyguard to you, I have to move in with you. Is that ok?"James went into shock for a minute. As he knew that it is going to be hard to sleep with a Beautiful Lady in the house. How was he going to handle the problem? He knew that there was no fighting it. He had to go with the flow as they say and get used to it. The one concern he had been how, long he is going to be able to keep his secret for a while. He did not want the world to know that the Famous Confederate General and Congressmen James Lee is still alive but at this time. It would have been better if he was still alive in the past, as it would cause fewer problems and make a more perfect story to tell. Another reason was that he was afraid whether what he did at Falmouth would be considered a war crime and be sent to trial at the United Nations for his crime. His crime that he believed was atrocious, while it was not as bad to what the Nazi's did but still he considered that it was bad enough. He should be put in prison for it."Very well. If you insist, my lady. I will take you to the Manor "James said, as he led her to the Leaky Caldron and grabbed her arm like gentlemen. So that they can travel back to the Manor through the Floo connection.Tonks smiled as she followed the Gentlemen into the Tavern. A gentlemen that she wish was her lover. She felt her heart wanting to grab this man that showed her so much kindness.Well, That is it, for now, everyone. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I promise to do the next chapter whenever I have the time, but I go back to College on the 19th; so I will be busy. Now, Let me give the results of the first poll. For: No is 18. Yes is 39. (WINNER)Now for the vote on how many people in the harem in the yes section: 2 Women is 4 votes. 3 Women is 14 votes. 4 Women is 6 votes. 5 Women is 15 votes. (WINNER)So in total, the results are that James will have a Harem but with only five women.  Now, here is the information for the second poll; which should be up in my profile by the time this chapter is up. The poll is to determine who should be in James's Harem. The max on choices you are allowed to make is four as I already intend on put Tonks in the Harem. For those that select the OC choice, just leave a review on what you think the OC should be like and such. The poll will last for 3-4 weeks or until there are at least 50 unique voters. Now if there are not any names in that you think that should be on the list, PM me before you put in your vote and I will see if it should be put in there. However, there will be people like Bellatrix and Narcissa in the list. There will be another chapter before the poll is done, I will try to give guys another before I go back to College; where I will be busy will a Math Course, 3 History Course, and a French Language Course. Now, let me give a few History lessons or reasons why I put some of the stuff in the Alternate History portion of the chapter.First, hold on to your hats this is a long one, let me say about the Mexican Empire and why I think if they had existed on during the First World War that they would accept the Offer from the Zimmermann Telegraph; which is the reason in the original time line why the United States got involved in the War. However, let me start a lesson on the short-lived Second Mexican Empire. The Empire was formed by the support of the Second French Empire, who wanted to gain back money on loans unpaid by Mexico and gain access to the markets of Latin America. Now, for anyone who knows the Monroe Doctrine, this would have violated it as the doctrine was something saying to Europe that the Americas is off limits to them and America will get involved. However, at the time, America was busy with its Civil War and the French knew that they would not have the time nor resources to intervene; which is why I think that they would be happy to recognize the Confederacy in the Original Time Line. However, they knew then England would then get involved to stop them if they did as it would be seen as a rerun of the Napoleonic Wars, even though England and Spain, as well as other Europe countries, supported France's Intervention into Mexico; as they believed that American cannot be able to live up to its Monroe Doctrine with the Civil War going on. France waited until England recognized the Confederacy, but that would never come. Then, The French recognized Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph as the Emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. They sent him troops, supplies, money, and more for his supposed rise to power. At first, the Imperials were winning, but that all changed immediately after the end of the American Civil War. As America forced Napoleon the Third out of Mexico diplomatically in a style that I would relate to the American pullout from Vietnam; where as soon as the French withdrew, the Republican forces began to kick Imperial butt out of the capital and other places in Mexico. Then it was all over when Emperor Maximilian the First was captured and executed in 1867, even though he had the chance to escape with the withdrawing French Army before being captured. Now, on to the alternate history of the Mexican Empire. First, let me say that if anyone was offended by this, I would like to apologize if it did. I was not choosing Mexico by any hatred, racist (especially with this coming election), or any bias. I only did that as had an opinion on what I think would actually happen, and I could be wrong. However, we will never know as this is alternative history and if the Empire had existed during World War One, then it could have gone differently. However, there is no evidence that it could have happened because the processor events to it have never happened. The Mexican Republic of the Original Timeline declined the offer because they did not want to cause any problems with the ABC Nations (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), knew that occupying the reconquered land would be impossible as the American civilians are well armed, and that the Americans are better armed than the Mexican Army. Now, let us got to the Alliance between the Union and Confederacy made with each other, many alternative theories say that a sort thing would happen between the two nations where it would be like North and South Korea with a Demilitarized Zone at the border. However, I think if there were a common enemy then an alliance is possible along with Treaty between the nations over Confederate Independence were fair then chances are stronger for the nations to have friendlier relations with each other. I think if the Empire won in the French Intervention then Maximilian would have hired Santa Anna as a General for he knows how to deal with rebels in his past and military history, excluding the part where he got captured at the Battle of San Jacinto. If one looks at his past, one would see that he has been known to be cruel and fearful in dealing with Rebels; see what he did at Zacatecas and one will see it clear as day. Or watch the movie the Alamo and I am talking about the newer one, not the John Wayne movie. The fact he has a hostile history with the Americans and Texans (like the Mier Expedition) could have both the Union as well as the Confederacy worried about what he will do if he convinces the Emperor of Mexico to Invade the two nations.Let me continue on the Confederate-Spanish War or as it is known in the Original Time Line the Spanish-American War. I think that even when the Confederacy got involved the Union would not, as it believe that the country would still be in the process of Reconstruction after losing basically half of its land in the Confederate War of Independence, they would be very busy in trying to prosper in other ways to repay its war loans. The Union would not have the resources to want to get involved in the war or even buy Alaska. However, the Union annexation of Hawaii would still happen as I think that it would help speed of the process of reconstruction as Hawaii is like the New York of the Pacific; a lot of trade goes through there as it is basically a stop and rest area for shipping. Think of it as a stopping area for 18-wheelers, it is to help the drivers rest for the night and refuel for their journey; that is essentially how economically important Hawaii was during annexation. Now, in the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war. The original timeline one allowed America to have Cuba and the Philippines as Protectorates and have control of islands like Porto Rico. I think in this timeline, the Confederacy would annex Cuba as it would be a big booster to the Economy with the Sugar and Tobacco in the area. The Philippines would still be a Protectorate as the Confederacy does not have Hawaii as a refueling station for helping control it in a major way through annexation; especially if they have a rebellion from the residents of that land after annexation. Now, let start with why James has control of the Washington House. To put it simply, Martha Lee nee Curtis is related to one of the four children that Washington raised with his wife, Martha Washington. They were not his birth children, but he cared for them as if they were of his actual blood.That is enough about that if anyone has questions about the alternative history of the story that I have forgotten please PM me and I will post it in the next chapter. Now, I would like to remind everyone about that challenge I posted in the story.

Disclaimer: I do not own anything. I do not own Harry Potter and Gods  Generals.Hey, Everyone. I met my promise and uploaded another chapter before I go back to college. Now, recently, I have received some PM's on some confusion and plot holes that the last chapter had, so to help fix that it will be in this chapter. For those that I have a message with on PM, thank you for informing me about those problems and I hope that in this chapter that I have answered your questions at a very detailed level.I would encourage everyone that if they see any holes or have any confusion, please PM me and I will give you a response with an answer as soon as possible. Now, as a reminder to everyone, I will soon be going back to college and then after the spring semester be most likely doing the Summer Semester. However, that does not mean that I will not be updating. I will be posting a new chapter, it is just as everyone knows the rate will be slow. However, I promise to bring a new chapter at most every 6 weeks. Also, one of the questions that I received in PM was about the nature of people that James will be with or more particularly their age. Especially since, I am moving James to 1993; where people like Hermione will be 13. If Hogwarts students are too young for James, then I will either do a marriage contract or aging spell or potion to help solve the problem. Another thing is about the inheritance last chapter, I would like to say that I think that I should improve it a little. However, I am not sure how. So I was wondering if anyone could give me some ideas on that issue? Also, contracts and powers for the inheritance are going to be in another chapter. It is just that inheritance in the last chapter was the finical inheritance, I did not add the other stuff as I have not decided yet and plus the poll for the women in James's Harem is still in progress. So, I did not wish to cause any problems there.Now, on to the chapter and please leave a review.Potter Manor near Cardiff, WalesSeptember 1st, 1993James woke up with the cold sweat on him as he heard screams of men after the sound of two loud explosions happened. He knew the meaning of those sounds, those where the sounds he heard during the famous fights of Falmouth. A battle that he still regrets to this day, where he did the most inhumane thing that he has ever done. James wished that he could go back and do something different. He could have had Rob move around Hancock and take him from the rear, but the Union Cavalry and Reverses would be blocking that move from being made. He could have used the tunnels to attack through Union from within, but he would not be able to get enough men through those tunnels at a good rate. It would be more of a turkey shoot. Every idea he had at the time and now would be another thing that a serious problem of initiating.He looked at the pocket watch that he kept with him during the war and saw that it was Seven o'clock. Tonks had told him that the Hogwarts Express leaves the station at exactly Eleven in the morning. He already had everything packed. Although, he prayed to God that he was not bombed by crazy fans again. James had enough of them in the History books both in the Muggle and Magical ones. As apparently, the Wizarding World was lead to believe that James was the one to defeat Voldemort by this Albus Dumbledore, who somehow knew that James was still alive somewhere. No one knows how exactly the Old Man figured it out as he did not say. Then when he had returned to the present, the House elves told him that there must have been a glitch or something wrong with the Time Traveling Portkey; as he should have arrived at least some time in 1991. This meant that he was somehow off course by two years in where he should have been. James guessed that it was an intervention by God, as he can make ultimate decisions for the world. This gave him the assumption that God did as he believed that James is more needed ahead of the time that he should have been.James also learned how everyone in that damn tavern knew who he was. By some stroke of luck, the Ministry of Magic detected his return through the magic inside the Portkey; where somehow his magic was also found in the signal that it gave off. Then Minister of Magical Cornelius Fudge decided to announce it to the whole country while showing off a picture of his late birth father's face to the Newspapers. James thought that he left the degree of stupid after Stephens conspired his 'death' with Booth, as he could tell that Fudge was looking for some public support to the Ministry. As people recognized his face by his father's face in the papers. He wished that idiot of a minister had not done that. However, it is too late now as everyone has a good idea on what he looks like. He told Tonks that Fudge will not have his vote in the next election. However, he was disappointed to know that the Minister is only elected by the higher officials of the Ministry. Those higher officials were the Wizengamot, who were the Legislative of the Ministry. Tonks compared to the British Parliament for James to understand, where basically government officials are in the Legislative Body. James at times felt that a Parliament like that should be elected by the people, not through the position that they are a part of. The Legislative Body is suppose to represent the interests of the people and being elected by the people is the best way to represent them. However, he was an American Congressmen; everything is different on how the people in European Countries want things done.After the circus, he went to watching a documentary about him in the Historical Channel. He was surprised to hear what history had to say about him. Apparently, there were moments erected with his name; like a stone statue of him sitting on a chair in Washington. The Confederacy even still views him as a hero, a young hero that fooled the world into thinking he is of agreeing to be in Congress; but only in a good way. Apparently, the revelation of his aged led to the allowed age to vote to be 17 in 1870 during his Father's presidency. James could say that the law was a perfect idea, as young men that died during the War for Independence deserved that right. History even gave him many titles like the Young Napoleon of the Confederacy or the Young Fighter of Virginia. There were even ships in the Confederacy that bared his name; the built as a Battleship in 1913 was the largest and most powerful ship afloat for some time until the British built their King George the V Battleship Class as well as the . The Battleship C.S.S. James Lee would be bombed by the Japanese in Dutch on December 8th, 1941 to the pointed that it turned on its side and the crew in that was alive inside the ship was trapped in there for at most 2 weeks.Then his name was on Aircraft Carriers, which showed James the turning of Naval Warfare as the sky can dominate the sea. Currently, the ship of this period that bears his name is one of three of the Confederacy's Supercarriers. James wished that they did not put his name on ships as he felt that he does not deserve that honor for what he did at Falmouth. During the documentary, he managed to keep his emotions to himself with Tonks in the house. He even remembering about the time he learned about the invention of the Automobile. To say he, at first, thought it was a Horseless Carriage, but he accepted the fact that the world has changed a lot since his 'passing' in 1867. He knew that the old world left is gone and transformed into something that he does not recognize. This means that it is something that he will have to adjust with.Tonks was a good guest to have in his house, she is kind and cheerful to him. She has a heart of gold, but when one angers her heart, it can turn into a monster that has not mercy for its victim. Tonks likes the Historical Channel as well as, especially when it shows documentaries about the Confederate War of Independence or more specifically her ancestor Jacob Tonks. She even likes his Southern cooking. Although, he does not do it much with the House Elves in the house. It makes them feel like that they are not doing their job of taking care of their master, which gets them crying so much that it could overflow the Mississippi River.He did wonder what kind of threat would want to hurt, besides the followers of Voldemort. It was then Tonks told him that Sirius Black had escaped, who was responsible for not only for the murder of 13 Muggle's but also for the betrayal of his parents to Voldemort, which led to their deaths and his arrival into the past with the family that he now misses very much. He escaped after being given the newspaper that announced his arrival back to the wizarding world. The last thing that the guards heard before he escaped the inescapable prison was him saying that "he's at Hogwarts." No one knows how he had escaped, some of the papers claim that it was dark magic. Tonks explained to him that the Minister was concerned that Black was now after James to finish what the Dark Lord had started many years ago before James was sent to the past. So, to make sure that he had public support Fudge assigned her as his body; especially with her abilities as a Metamorphmagus; which James had no idea what it was until she explained and showed her ability to him. As she transformed her mouth to look like one that a duck would have, which made James smile at the funniness of it.James slowly returned to the presented as he heard a knock on his door. He knew that since he already has his pajamas on that, it would be alright to let the person in his room. He careful got out of them bed and yelled for the person to come in. He could hear the door open slowly. When he turned around, his breath was taken and began to feel the light head. In came, Tonks with one of the manors red bathrobes around her body. The robe was a perfect fit for her body, he could say for sure that many men in the South from his time would want her hand in marriage. Even with her abilities, she has the best looks that would be the envy of all the Southern Belle's. As she wore this, she was brushing her teeth. James wondered why must the Good Lord must torture him with such beauty that has an ability that shows a man's true self. Her eyes...Oh lord...Her eyes shown bright with the color of red that matched the robe that she was wearing. He stopped in his train of thoughts as she spoke to him with a heavenly voice."Wotcher, now! Did you have a goodnight's sleep, Harâ¦I mean James?"James nodded, slowly. As he grabbed his glasses and put them on. He may be partly blinded, but he can still see well."So, what time we leave for the platform, Tonks?" He asked as he was not sure how long it would take for his baggage to be loading in the Train."We probably need to be there by no more than 10:30. As it does not take long to load our luggage into the baggage cars and to find a seat. Most of the students do not board until the last minute just to say goodbye to their parents and relatives." She answered.James nodded as he knew that he did not have anyone besides the House Elves to say goodbye. He felt a wave of sadness wash over him as he knew that he had to accept the fact that he really is alone in this world. An outsider with no one that he knew still living. Tonks saw his face and felt concerned."Are you alright?" she asked softly.James nodded as he said, "I will be okay. Thank you, though.""If there is anything that I can do for you, please let me know. I cannot handle to see a sad face like yours," she explained with a tone of concern."I will, thank you.""Now go and get yourself cleaned. The Elves are almost done cooking breakfast and we need to leave by 9:45 to get close enough to the platform without being seen by Muggle's." She instructed him with her sweet and kind voice.James nodded again, as she left to get fully dressed. Slowly, he looked to his small cabinet and opened the first drawer to pull out a small photograph. The photo was in black and white that showed him with his family before. He put his fingers on the faces of his now dead family. His family that is now in heaven and in the loving arms of the Holy Father. Oh, how he wished that he could be with them again. Just one last time is all he asks. But he knew that is impossible, a wish that will never be answered. He put the photo into a bag that he will take with him to the train. Slowly he walked into the bathroom to shower and crying for a little bit.Meanwhile in the hallway outside of James's room, Nymphadora Tonks was really concerned about James. As she knew that there was something bothering the young man. Something that was very painful to him. She really wished that there was a way where she could be of some assistance to James. She remembered back when she was just a toddler, where her mother would take her to see the man when he was just a little baby. She smiled as she had a flashback when she would make funny faces with her abilities, which to Baby Harry or James to laugh and wanted to touch her. Both of their parents laughed at it. After James's parents were killed, she always wondered he went. Now, she wondered who raised him and taught him to be such a gentlemen. It had to be someone from the Confederate States of America, as James had that Southern Accent. As that accent is hard to fake, it was a natural one. One that his adopted parents or caretakers had when they raised him.However, for some reason, he looked very familiar to her as someone else. Someone besides the picture of his dad in the newspapers, she is talking about someone that she had once read about in her father's book cabinet. She did not know why she thought of it, but her head was telling that there is something that is awfully familiar about James and the answer lies inside her father's Cabinet. But the only thing in her Father's cabinet were old history books that talk about all the popular wars that had happened in the world. She shook her head. No that would be any helpful at all. But she did think about at least checking whenever she has the chance.Hogwarts Express on its way to Hogwarts1:00 P.M.To say that Richmond had the best Train service that he had ever seen was no wrong, on the way to the Platform was somewhere James had no idea existed first. The number Nine and Three Quarters sounded like a joke to him, until Tonks pushed him through one of the barriers between Nine and Ten. He was taken by surprise of the magic in the place and now he loved it. Tonks was showing him that there was more to magic than just a bunch of wand waving.Although, he wished that he did not have to go to School; he could just do a Muggle job and live a happy life. However, he remembered that the House Elves had told him that as much that they can be a teacher to him; He is required to learn magic at a magical institution for at least 4 years when taught through tutors or home schooled. It was by luck that the Ministry accepted it for James, as Dumbledore wanted him in Hogwarts for all seven years of education in his school. However, his grades were very high through the homeschooling that he received in a truck that inside is like a small house and slows down time at a very good rate. This has what helped him be able to skip four out of the seven years in education that he needs to take. James decided to let it go, as he remembered that his birth parents went to this school. He figured that he will go just to honor them and everything that they did for him when he was a baby; he figured that he owned a huge debt for his survival during the confrontation with Voldemort.The train comfortable for its size. The compartments were not large, but luxurious for a bunch of school students. He ran into many students that looked like they were his age during the war. A good portion of them was as uncivilized as the people in the tavern, many of them kept pointing at him saying things like "That's Harry Potter," "Why does he have that scar on his forehead?", "He looks old enough to be a teacher!" and many other things. That had really annoyed James, who wanted to pull out his Navy Revolver and shot every one of them. This generation really has no sense of humanity, civilization, and maturity. He damned Booth for causing him to meet these little brats that do not respect his privacy. He wished that he could meet another person that is not like these uncivilized children. Someone that was like Tonks, who luckily got him to the nearest compartment for safety. He guessed that Auror's hate Hound dogs as well as. He never did tell her that he has a Muggle Gun, he did not want to take the chance that she would take it away from him. He really wanted to have it with him, as he kept to his father's rule of protecting women at all times of travel; even though Tonks is here to keep him safe.It was then he noticed the compartment that they had entered and locked was not empty. Inside there were two people. One was old and the other was young. The older one had brown hair with a little gray that showed his age, he had three scars that looked like that they were from claws on his face, and James guessed that he was somewhere in his late thirties. He wore heavy clothing that was a mix of brown and gray. James could not tell what the color of his eyes was as he was asleep. In fact, he was so asleep that he was snoring loudly.James then turned his attention to the other person. He could only guess that his age was at least 15. He had brown hair that was darker than the old man next to him. The clothing he wore were the same kind of black robe that James is wearing right now. Only the difference is that he had the crest of the Hogwarts House of Slytherin. Tonks had him explained to him about a week ago over each of the four houses in Hogwarts. The young man's eyes were blue and his body was really skinny. James felt that he was similar to someone that he once knew. Someone from his time that he knew very well during the War of Independence; but he could not be able to put his finger on it. His answered came when the Young Man spoke."Hello, Champs. I guess that you are Harry Potter. Do not worry, I am not like those savages in the hall. In fact, it would be against my family honor and name to be like them. People should really learn to be more polite and respectful these days. I am glad that I was raised differently. My name is Jacob Freemantle, son of Mary and James Freemantle, and the Descendant of Colonel John Freemantle during the Confederate War of Independence; where he got the famous title as the Marquis de Layette of the Confederacy. I must say that it is an honor to meet you Mr. Potter and Missâ¦?" he stated in a perfectly English tone as he looked at Tonks in trying to guess her name."Just call me Tonks" Tonks answered with sincerity."Miss. Tonks. A beautiful name for a charming Woman." He said.Tonks never had blushed so hard before. Meanwhile, James was surprised. Here he found another person relate to someone that he fought with in the War. Either he has gotten lucky or God is trying to help him adapt to this time period. He can say that without a doubt that Colonel Freemantle's Family is still the honorable one that it was in his time period. He wondered who else was going to meet at the school."So what brings you here Tonks? You looked like that you are old enough have already graduated from Hogwarts. I do not mean to be rude to you, of course. It is just that I am curious." Jacob asked with a kind voice."Well, the Ministry assigned me to be the bodyguard to Harry where every he goes. Yes, I did graduate Hogwarts and it was in 1992." She answered."Ah, that is understandable with the Ministry. Especially with Black scurrying around the country. They say that he is heading to Hogwarts to kill Mr. Potter. However, I doubt that he will take this train to get there. It is too risky. He would have to walk there, because the areas to walk to there are rarely checked for anything dangerous." Jacob replied."I hope that you do not mind me asking, are you a Muggle-Born? Because if you are, then let me also ask is how did you survive being in that house filled with Pureblood Supremacist?" Tonks asked with a serious tone.Jacob chuckled as he said in his English accent, "Well, Miss. Tonks. The answer to the first question is yes. I am a Muggle-Born. The answer to the second question is that it takes all of the courage and willingness to handle insults. My father is a politician and has to deal with verbal insults from his opponents. He managed taught me many of his techniques to remain calm, as I wanted to be just like him."James remembered Tonks telling him about how that there was a lot of racism given from Purebloods, who wanted to be rid of the Muggle-borns in the Wizarding World. As they have the belief that they are better than the "Mudbloods" as the word that they called them. To say James thought it was just that one little shit named Draco Malfoy that was a racist, now he felt like he was back in the days of extreme racism towards slaves. Lord, why must he always have to face problems like that. He can just leave in peace with people that are civilized and respectful."Who is that beside you?" James asked.Jacob looked at the man and said, "To be honest, I have no clue. Lord knows, I do not even know why he is even here. I mean the reason I choose to sit in this compartment was to avoid Malfoy and his fat goons. I highly doubt that the man is a student. Maybe he is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. I mean every year the school needs a new one as something bad always happens to them. I say last year's Professor turned out to be a fraud, during the Chamber of Secrets Crisis. Hell, I was the one with Neville when we found him packing his bags and had to force him to follow us into the chamber after we followed Ginny to it. Poor girl, she was possessed by the demon Tom Riddle and compelled to do his bidding. I hope she has gotten the proper help needed to recover from it. Then the year before, we had Quirrell; who completely fooled us with his bloody stuttering. He had the Dark Wanker Voldemort or Tom Riddle literally on the back of his head from what Neville told me. Good thing Dumbledore arrived in time to save Neville. Quirrell was close to killing the poor boy."James was now concerned. It appears from what Jacob has been telling him, Voldemort has been making attempts in the castle to kill people. He did not know much of the Chamber of Secrets, but, by the way Jacob has been explaining it that Hogwarts is not safe. Hell, Children should not be there after what happen. How could this place still be opened after everything that he just heard? Were people in the Wizarding World foolish or greed for the money in the tuition that parents pay for their child's education?"That is Remus Lupin. I remember him from my childhood, before theâ¦" Tonks stopped as if it was something that she felt ashamed about."Nevermind," She said sadly.James was concerned for her. It had to be something dreadful if she was feeling like. Something that could hurt her and her family."Well, seeing that he is asleep. I will say these word. He better be a good teacher with good knowledge of the subject that he is instructing, a good guy with high morals, and does not bloody stutter. If not, then I will pack up my bags and swim my arse across the Atlantic to learn at the Richmond Institute of Magic." Jacob said.James and Tonks chuckled at him. As James could see that Mr. Lupin had a small grin on his face. This told James that the man was not asleep and just faking it.Then the door to the compartment opened, revealing a plump woman with a cart of sweets in it."Anything off the trolley dears?" she asked.Jacob looked at James and asked if he had any wizarding candy before. James shook his head and said that he did not want anything. Jacob looked at Tonks, who said that she will have some Sugar Mice; while Jacob asked for a Chocolate Frog.Hours went by as the weather outside began to get rougher. However, that was not what James concerned. He began to think of everything. How his life was now in a different world, the world where everything he had known has changed to something else. He wished that he was home, back home in 1867. Everything different is too much for him to handle. His nerves were getting to him. Then it all stopped when the train came to a screeching halt. The train stopped so hard that it nearly threw Jacob to the other side of the compartment. Then the next thing James knew was that the lights went out. The only light he could see was from the window. However, the strength of the light from it began to reduce as it was suddenly covered with ice. James did not know how it happened, but it did. James started to feel cold and see his breath as the cold intensified.He could see that everyone else was cold. He looked to the man, who was still 'asleep.' James really doubted that anyone could sleep through this; so he just shook his head at the man. His thoughts stopped as the train shook back and forward, like as if something was trying to push it or break in. James was now concerned, as this was not something that was broke in the train. It was something trying to get into the train and do god knows what. When he heard the door to their compartment open, he quickly pulled out his wand; ready to cast a spell on whoever was trying to get inside."Wait, I am a friend of Jacob's," It said in a scared and male voice.Jacob stood up as he recognized the voice and said, " Neville, is that you?""Yes, it is me. I just came back from Hermione to check on you." The voice responded.James watched as Neville sat next to Jacob. The dark was preventing James from describing the looks of Neville. Then James heard a noise coming down the hall. The noise that he heard frightened him, as it sounded like something that came from hell. Something not human, something like a demon. Quickly, he closed the door and locked it. He had Tonks move aside as they both pointed their wands at the gate. Ready to take down whatever it was inside the train. They could see the black figure of something. Something that is definitely not human or unholy in James's opinion. It looked like something that in a black robe with a skeletal figure. Then came the greatest shock to James, as he saw that it had somehow unlocked the door and opened it. As it was looking at each and everyone in the compartment. James could see that it had a hood covering its face, with only a small hole for a mouth. It continued to make the demonic sound that James heard it achieved in the hall. James wondered what it was going to do next, now that it found people in this compartment. Until it turned its attention towards James.Then suddenly, James began to feel colder. His head and mind were losing strength. He felt like something was being sucked out of him. Then things started to get worse. Voices were being heard in his head."Run Lily, It's Him. Take Harry and Run. Start the Ritual.""Please, not Harry! Please Kill Me Instead of Harry! Please!""Move Aside, You Silly Girl!"It did not stop there as he began to hear memories and sounds from his past.{BANG}{Screams}"Sic Semper Tyrannis!""Long Live The South!"He then heard the sounds of his adopted mother crying loudly. He barely remembered hearing her as he was in and out before the operation on his chest. Then the next thing he knew was that his world went black.When he opened his eyes, he felt the air turn warm again. He then heard the sound of the Train's whistle blowing. He looked around and saw concerned eyes looking at him. Everyone in the compartment was checking him to see if he was alright. He heard Tonks ask him if he was alright and he responded that he was fine. He heard Jacob ask if he was sure; to which James responded even stronger that he was fine. He saw that Mr. Lupin was awake and pulled something out of his pocket."Here eat this, it will help," He said as he handed him the item.James looked at it for a second, trying to determine what it is. It was soft but a little hard with a sweet smell to it. The item was shaped like a rectangle with one side being rough and the other very smooth."It is alright. It is just chocolate. " Lupin assured him.James nodded. Slowly, he took a bite and found it very delicious. It had a sweet texture, unlike anything that he had ever tasted. It was like nectar of the gods. He began to feel much better than he was earlier. As he gathered more strength, he looked back to Mr. Lupin and decided to ask him a question."What was that thing?""That was a Dementor. One of the Dementor's from Azkaban. They guard the Wizard prison. I suspect that they entered the Train to see if Sirius Black was in here. Do not know why they tried to suck your soul out, but I promise that you will be fine now. They left now after I banished them. Now, I am going to speak to the conductor. We will be arriving near Hogwarts at about two to three hours. Now, just keep eating that chocolate, you will feel better." He said while walking out of the compartment.James nodded as he felt that Train speeds up to the rate that it was going before being stopped by the Dementor. He looked at the others in the compartment and decided to ask them a question."What happen while I was out?"He heard Neville speak, who was a skinny boy who looked 13 with blond hair and wore the crest of Gryffindor on his robe."Well, when the Dementor came in, you sort of went out like a light. Then as soon as you fainted, Mr. Lupin came up and casted some sort of spell. Then it just left, as the spell gave off this bright light. Like it was poison to it.""Are you sure that you are alright?" Tonks asked again."Yea. I am alright. What about you guys?" he asked looking at them.They are replied saying that they are fine. A little shaken, but fine.Meanwhile, James could not help but think of what had happened and heard from this encounter. He wondered why he heard the memories that he had, especially with it having him understand his parents death and his own assassination from Booth. He even questioned the humanity that the Ministry has towards using these demons from hell as the guardians of a wizard prison. Surely the UN would not approve of this. Hell, even he thought that the utilization of these monsters is a crime against humanity. These demons should eliminated. He could say that this would be the only time, where he believes that an entire race of something should be extinct. As these things do not have a care in the world that suck a soul from, but only that they get one; whether it is collateral damage to the Ministry or not.Outside of Hogwarts8:00 P.M.The castle was beautiful. James could see that everything in the castle was medieval. The stone walls looked like they were centuries old. Even the sight of it outside when he rode the carriage that was being pulled by a horse with wings. He could say for sure that this place is magical and that was just from seeing the external portion of the castle, after seeing it from all the way from the Hogwarts Express. The area was large and put on good land; as there was a lake that was connected to the sea, which is west of the property. There was also a large forest that was near the castle, with a kind of creepy vibe to it. James believed that it was probably a good idea to not go exploring there as it had the signs of death awaiting anyone willing to go inside the forest. He did not why, but he had that feeling of it.When he left the train after it stopped on a platform not far from the school, he really did not like the idea of going on a boat to see the view of the school. As he saw what he could describe as a giant direct the First-year students to the boats. James did not know how to swim, in case worst comes to worst. So he told Tonks that he was going to follow the other students to the school. At first, she felt that he should take the boat to the school, but allowed it as she remembered her job and after James explained to her about his inability to swim; which at times activate a fear of drowning on him. He never did learn how to swim back in his time; as the Potomac was too deep for him to swim in normal conditions. James did really enjoying the comfort that the carriage ride to the castle offered as it helped fall asleep on Tonks's shoulder until they arrived after about fifteen minutes. As she woke him up, which led to him realizing whose shoulder he was sleeping. He continuously apologized to her as he felt very ungentlemanly to her. She said that it was alright and that it did feel good, though; where she then blushed after realizing what she just said.He followed her into the castle, where she led him to the entrance to the main hall. As the students and teachers were already in there, as he noticed that somehow he was late for something. The reason was he heard names being called out at the front of the room, where they were the first-years huddling up at the front as their names were being called. The room was spectacular, with its ceiling being concealed by the some sort of illusion of the night sky; with stars that made it more real to James. He even noticed that there were four long rows of tables in the Great Hall, which were filled with lots of students that are of each school house. He could say for sure that this Castle and school was amazing by everything inside of it. Particularly with the Ghosts floating around. He kept walking forward, as he heard Tonks whisper to him."I will wait by a corner. Now, know this, do not worry about what others will think about the house that you go into. It is only about you. I think that your parents would still be happy for you, even if you were placed in a different house than they were in."James nodded as he waited for five minutes to hear his name be called."Potter-Lee, Harry"Slowly he walked up to the woman with the green wizard hat and glasses; while hearing the other students talk."The Harry Potter?""Harry Potter? The one who defeated You-Know-Who and disappeared all these years?""Why does he have that scar on his forehead?""Why does he have Lee after his last name?'"Where do you suppose he has been for the past years?""Fighting for the Independence and survival of a nation!" He thought to himself after hearing that last question.The woman instructed him to sit on the stool. The kind of seat that reminded him of teachers during his time would have delinquent students sit on near a corner. He carefully placed himself on the stool noticing that everybody in the room was looking at him. They were staring at him to find out what house he is going to be in. He saw Jacob in the Slytherin table waving at him. James smiled at him, as the woman placed a very old hat on the top of his head.Then he heard a voice in his head said, "Well, Well. Very Interesting. Very Interesting."James looked around and did not see anyone speak."Do not worry, Mr. Potter. It is just me the Sorting Hat. Or should I call you Congressmen or General Lee, instead of Mr. Potter?" The voice continued.James began to get concerned as the Hat knew his history. He wondered if the Hat was going to tell everyone his greatest secret."You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Potter. I am bound by the magic of the founders to not reveal anything about students unless it concerns their safety and health. I cannot even betray the heir of three of the houses."James wondered what the hat meant on that last part, until he remembered his inheritance. He had control of three vaults to the founders of the school: Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor."Ah, but you have control of more than just. Look for the Come and Go room, which is where you find out more about what you do not already know. Now, on to the sorting. Where was I? Oh, yes. You are a very interesting and challenging person to sort. You have a high strength of Loyalty that fits as a Hufflepuff, particularly to your State of Virginia. But you have the Intelligence of a Ravenclaw from your intelligent during the war and the Courage of a Gryffindor from your determination to defend your State. However, you have the cunningness of Slytherin; especially with what you did at Versailles and Falmouth. This causes me a problem as all of those traits are all equal to each other; which means that I cannot be able to choose on what is best for you. So, I think that the best way to solve this problem is by allowing you to choose your house. Now, which one do you wish to be in?"James began to think. He did not what the Come and Go room is. It was something that he will ask Tonks about later. As he started to think about he is on this stool for, which is to be sorted into a house. James decided to look at the ups and downs in each one of them. He did not mind being in Slytherin with Jacob, but he was afraid that he would kill Malfoy with his pistol one of these days; which could be very soon. He looked over to Gryffindor, the house that his birth parents were once sorted in. He did not mind being in that house, the only problem was that he recognized most of the hound dogs from the train in that house. Well, excluding Neville, of course. Neville did not do what his housemates did. However, he decided it would be best for his health to not be placed in that House. Either Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff would be a better choice. They have their advantages, but he could not see anything against the two houses. He began to think more of his past and thought which House was one that fits his career during the War. It was then he made his made choice, loyalty to his state of Virginia is stronger than any of his other traits."I wish to be in Hufflepuff," He told the hat."Very well, if you are sure. Then better beâ¦HUFFLEPUFF." The Hat said, yelling out the last word as an announcement to the school.Everyone clapped as James stood up and walked to the Hufflepuff table; where many people in the house welcomed him in their house. James felt happy after that was over while noticing that as soon as he took a seat Tonks came over and sat right next to him."Congratulations on making Hufflepuff. You know it was my house during my days here at Hogwarts.""Really?" he asked."I am not kidding you."James nodded as he decided to watch as the sorting continued for ten minutes, where all the rest of the first years were sorted into their houses. As Hufflepuff got a couple more new members in its House. Then suddenly, food appeared on the tables out of thin air. James could say that he was for sure surprised and amazed at the beautiful things that Magic can do. All the students quickly grabbed some food and put them on their plates. James could say that this was not a dinner, it was a feast as they were so much food that it could feed a homeless man for at least a year. After the stool had been put away by disappearing like how the food on the table appeared on the table, James looked over to the table where all the teachers and staff sit. He noticed one of them was looking at him with a hateful glare. It was not like a glare that he hated his looks or anything, but it was one of those glares that told James that he hated everything he stood for. The man had black hair with a lot of grease, a hocked nose, eyes that were as dark as one's soul could, and a black robe. James was concerned if he had done something to cause the man to hate him that bad. He asked Tonks if she knew anything about the man."Oh, you mean Snape. Do not worry Harry. He just hates everyone that is not in Slytherin. But expect him to be a prick to you in Potions because that is what he teaches and be favorable to his little snakes as Head of Slytherin. No offense to Jacob, of course. It is just that has a bad name for being known to have been the house that has had the most Death Eaters during You-Know-Who's time of terror." She informed him.James wondered what turned that man into who he is, and was concerned about if there really is fairness inside this school. Teachers are supposed to be equal to all students. James really hated it when people called Voldemort names like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who, as that is what still brings the fear of him in this country. It should be time to move on and not continue to live in fear. However, he doubts that he convince everybody in the world with that message. He then turned his attention to an old man with lots of white, he looked ancient, had a weird type of robe, and spectacles. The old man was talking with the woman that had taken part in the sorting. He had no idea who that was and trying to find out while everyone was eating."Oh, that is Professor Dumbledore. He is the Headmaster of the school and along with other titles as well as duties that I cannot remember because there are so bloody many. He is a genius and a little nutty at times. But he is alright." Tonks explained to him, as she began to eat some mash potatoes.James nodded as he went to eating. However, he decided to eat like gentlemen. Like wearing a napkin around his neck and eating slower than everyone else in the tables. This got a few stares directed at him from the students, which he ignored. As he was raised to be a Southern Gentlemen and no one will change that from him. He continued eating for the next hour until he heard the tapping on a glass by a spoon. He and everyone else turned their attention to the person making the noise. It turned out that it was Headmaster Dumbledore. James could only guess that he had an announcement to make. It ended up that James was correct, as the Headmaster stood up to begin speaking.He welcomed everyone the first years and the old students back to Hogwarts. He gave his reminders that no magic is to be used between classes and corridors, that there are certain items banned by the Caretaker of Hogwarts, and that the forest outside is strictly forbidden. He then continued on that Remus Lupin, who was the man that helped James in the train, is this year's Teacher in Defense Against the Dark Arts. He then explained that for this year the Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts Rebus Hagrid is the Teacher for the class in Care of Magical Creatures. Both professor's received claps from everyone in the school, except a good portion of the students in Slytherin. James could tell that it may have to do with the fact that the man is very tall. Abnormally tall, as no regular human could ever get that tall. However, he had nothing against the man; he looks like a person that is gentlemen that would fit in with a southern society. He wondered if the man has ever since the beautiful land of Virginia, as he developed the belief that he has done a lot of traveling around the world.James then turned his attention to Dumbledore as he continued on about the Dementors, as they are here to guard the School from the wanted criminal Sirius Black."Yea, but what is protecting the school from the savage Dementors?" He thought, as he still thought that these demons should not even be on this earth.In his mind, the monster should only be staying with the Devil in hell. The Dementors should only guard the realm of hell, not anything that is of the living. He did know what that idiot Fudge was thinking, but he is really close to wanting to tie the fool to a tree and execute him with his Navy Revolver. The only problem with that is it would damage his Southern Honor and would make him as bad as Sirius Black. Although, James did want to find Black and bring him to justice for the betrayal that he has done to his birth parents. A man that betrays his best friends deserves nothing but death, where he face judgment from the Holy Father. He heard Dumbledore explain that it is unwise to leave Hogwarts grounds at night and to provoke the Dementors, as they feast on happy memories.Dumbledore then finished off his speech by having the entire school sing the Hogwarts anthem, which the lyrics were painful for James's ears as every student had their own tune to it. He swore that he heard someone make a sad like tune that sounded like he was at a funeral. He did not know who made that, but what he did know was that it came from the Gryffindor table. James was glad that it was over, when Dumbledore dismissed them as he explained that it was time for everyone to go to bed. Tonks thought that it would be beneficial for him to follow the first years, but James told her no. he had enough of the Hound Dogs for today and hopefully for the rest of his life. However, he doubted that last part. Tonks understood James as she decided to take a detour to the Hufflepuff Common Room. She showed him the grand staircases, which gave James a real shiver as he hated heights. She then showed him Library, which was beautiful and filled with loads of books that he will read in the future.By the time, they reached the kitchens it was almost Eleven O'clock. James wondered at first why they were in the kitchens until she led him to a large stack of barrels. The barrels were piled on their sides, where James could see the lids on them. He watched as Tonks tapped the middle lid on the second row from the bottom. However, she tapped in a tune that James could tell was in some kind of name. He played a lot of tunes on instruments during his time and could tell when it is of a word.He watched as the lid to the barrel opened to show a hole that is large enough for him to crawl through. To which Tonks told him that is what he has to do. Although, James told her to go first as she is a Lady. After they crawled out of the other side of the entrance. James was shown a beautiful room filled with lavish couches, a large fireplace with the moving painting of a beautiful woman above it, and with many plants all over the place."So, what do you think of it?" Tonks asked with a smile.James looked at her with a smile as well as saying "It is beautiful. It is probably the closest thing to heaven that I will get."Tonks yawned as said, "Well, I am going to sleep in the Girls Dormitory. At least, that is what Headmaster Dumbledore said that I would for now. You will be sleeping in the Boys Dormitories, the entrance to it is at that the right tunnel covered by that lid."James nodded as he said, "Thank you, Tonks. Goodnight."Slowly, he opened the lid and crawled through the tunnel; as he was looking forward to a goodnight's rest. He really needs it.I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Also, I would like to let everyone know that when the week that I am off of college and work for a week; I will use that time to fix any grammar errors or anything else that has to edit in all the story's chapters. Maybe, I will even add some extra stuff if needed. I do not know when that week is, but when I find out; I will post an update about it for everyone. If there is anything that needs to add or fixed, please let me know through a PM. Again, I would like to thank the people that have informed me of the plot holes that I accidently left in the last chapter. And I encourage them and everyone, to please PM me should there find any plot holes and I promise that I will reply to you. I promise to do my best to even fix those plot holes.Another thing, if there is anyone from the United Kingdom, If I must understood on how Parliament works and got it wrong; please let me know. I am not very good at understanding on how your government works and if I had insulted you in any way; then I would like to apologzie. i would have used Wikipedia, but as a college student in a History degree program I have developed a belief in not using it until I know the sources used are reliable. I even used some of the stuffed that I have learned in College inside this story.Also, I am pretty sure, some of you wanted to vote on what house James goes in. However, I thought it would be better for the story that James goes into Hufflepuff, as I drew many connections to his past and character. However, in the future, I can do something where a new house is created. If you want to do that then let me know in the comments. One last thing, I would like to remind everyone about that challenge that I have posted.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or anything. Hey, Everyone. Sorry, It took so long. After school, I have been busy getting ready for the summer semester and for another attempt at the GRE. Although, the last Semester, I have done very well and missed write a chapter for this story. I want to continue writing this story, but I want to write another story in order keep my creative juices flowing; whenever I have a writer's block for this story. But my priority will be on Harry Potter-Lee. So, I created another story about the time jewel that James uses, to return to the future, malfunctions and lands him in the Red Alert 3 Universe of Command and Conquer. This results in him having to join with the Allies to fight against the advancing Soviet Union in a type of war that he has never fought before and will really have to put his skills to the test.  Also, I would like to announce that after a full college semester the poll for which girls gets to be in James's Harem is over. At the end of the chapter, you will see in the chapter. For those that voted, I would like to thank you.  Another thing, I would like to mention is that next week I will be doing Summer school; so I will be busy. However, this will not impact my ability to write chapters for you guys. If there is anything that might hinder my writing is the coming release of Heart of Iron 4 next week, which I am really looking forward to. But I will balance it out with my writing if it becomes a problem.  Now, in this chapter, James goes to Hogsmeade with Tonks to relax and along the way he meets some new friends.Hufflepuff Common RoomNovember 12, 1993So far, this school proved to be easy for James to learn at. He excelled greatly at the subjects like Charms and Transfiguration. He worked hard to make his parents proud. Another reason that he worked hard was that he knew that he would need this education for his coming fight against the Dark Lord Voldemort. Education to a soldier is a major factor that is necessary to win a war against the enemy. However, soldiers need to perform greatly in their education to be successful in a war; just being a school and not learning will not work. It is another form of overconfidence to James, and that was what resulted in his enemies during the War of Independence to be defeated as well as humiliated deeply.The only class James was having trouble with was Potions with Professor Snape. It turned that Tonks was not wrong when saying that the man was unfair and biased towards the Slytherin House. He treated everyone in the other houses like as if they were shit and James was against the idea of a teacher doing that to children. James may have gone to VMI, but he was more mature than any of the children in his class. In his mind, James thought that this man should never have been a teacher. Especially in how the greasy bastard has personal been treating him. The Snake criticized him in just about everything from his hard work as well as knowledge all the way to his very existence. It was like as if Snape had something personal against him like somehow he hated for something than just being in Hufflepuff or whatever.When the Asshole once made a comment about his father, James wanted to shoot him with his Navy revolver; even though James knew that he was talking about his Birth-father. Although, it did tell James that the hatred Snape had for him was because of something that his father, James Potter, had done before James was actually born. The Snake was actually hurting his grade because he was grading James and pretty everyone else not in Slytherin unfairly; and without even seeing the result of their potions. One girl named Hermione Granger, who was in Ravenclaw and academic rival but a friend as well as a student that managed to advance a year ahead in the school, worked very hard on her potion in class and followed the instructions correctly. However, Snape made up some bullshit that she did something wrong, and it really had hurt the poor girl, as he also called her a "silly girl." James felt sorry for the girl, no one should be hurting a person that is willing to work hard for their grade. It was at this point, he was getting ready to plans in reporting the Snake for the trouble and pain that he is causing to the students, who are not of Slytherin House.He told Tonks this, who said that many had tried to report the bastard before but Dumbledore just waved it off. It was at this point, James knew that if he were to make his move; then he would have to report it to the authorities that are higher than Dumbledore. The only people would have to be the Board of Directors in Hogwarts, who can override Dumbledore and get rid of Snape; where they would then have to find a new Potions Master to teach the Students. But what he will need is evidence and plenty of it. Tonks agreed with him on this idea and said that she would help him in his plan; because according to her, Snape was one of the reasons why she had to work harder than she needed to get the grade required to become an Auror.The new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts was fantastic, James would have to say. He taught the subject very well, and he was better than the previous professors before him; according to Jacob Freemantle, at least, who James was becoming great friends with. Professor Remus Lupin made sure that everyone understood the content that he was trying to teach and showed them a practical example; which was very helpful. The only problem that James had with him was that for an unknown reason he canceled class, he could only assume that it was maybe because of some kind of rare illness. But he was not completely sure. He could tell that Tonks knew, but she was not telling him anything. She had that look showing that she knew why Lupin was canceling class. However, he was not going to force her to say him; that is something that a gentleman does not do to a woman and would hurt his Southern Honor. He decided to let it go and continue on with everything else.However, on Halloween, an event had happened that put the entire school into fear. The bastard Sirius Black had tried to get into the Common Room in Gryffindor. It was discovered when the Fat Lady, who guards the entrance to the Common Room, was removed from her painting by the rageful murderer after denying him access. Dumbledore ordered for the Castle to be on lock down and for every student to head to the Great Hall, where they would all sleep for the rest of the night. James did not mind sleeping in the hall, but one thing was on his mind. Why did Sirius Black try to get in the Gryffindor Common Room, particularly as it was after James? James sleeps in the Hufflepuff Common Room, not Gryffindor. So this confused James in a whole new level and asked Tonks this question. Tonks replied that Sirius was best friends with his father, and they both were in Gryffindor. Black might have thought that James was in Gryffindor like his father, and that would be where he would have to look for James. James figured that would make sense. He remembered that he did not find that the Come-and-Go Room that the Sorting Hat was talking. He knew that it was something important, but he wondered what exactly would be in there that required his full attention.Besides all the negatives that he had, the school itself was great. It was big and a comfortable place to be. The library was big and spacious. The grounds of the school were beautiful. He felt like he was in a land of wonder, with all the friendly ghost and paints that he could talk to whenever he wanted to. Tonks showed him around the castle the day after he was sorted into Hufflepuff, and found everything about the castle to be excellent. It was ultimately bigger than his own house and any fort that he saw during his time in the Confederate Army.He frowned as he thought back to his time in the Confederate Army and during the War of Independence; he missed everything back in the old days of his life. He missed Jacob Tonks, General Jackson, His father, His Siblings, and everything. The most famous thing he did was serving the Confederacy in politics where he could continue ensuring that it stays firm to defend it when it needs to against any invaders. He damned Booth and Alexander Stephens for preventing from serving the Confederacy and his home state of Virginia; which he is glad to find out that he was actually born in the Old Dominion State, as it turned that his parents decided to go for vacation and tour it all the way to Cuba. Then the moment they landed in Virginia, he was born; at least according to the House Elves back at Potter Manor. It made him happy to know that he is still a Virginian by birth and a citizen of the Confederacy.He wondered if his parents saw the statue that the Confederacy made of him near the State Capitol in Richmond, which was an accurate likeness of him. It even had his lightning bolt scar on the forehead with a plaque that one of his sayings in warfare. He even remembered writing it inside his memoirs or journal. It was saying that he pretty much told every officer in the Confederacy and it was even published in the newspaper. Now, people use as a saying to life and a good portion of individuals who had heard of it actually follow it correctly.His phrase was: Never be overconfident about something or it will result in you being humiliated in the future.James never intended to be such an influence on people, he only wanted to serve in the honor of both his home state of Virginia and the Confederate States of America. A confederacy that has today become one of the strongest and power nations in the world; with a strong economy and military, it has become one of the most influential nations that have ever existed. With the alliance between the Union, the Confederacy was a force that survives anything that the world could throw against. It and the United States of America are the leaders of Democracy, who have been protecting nations that have followed the democratic principles of a republic since their involvement in the Second World War. Oh, how James would have loved to be a part of the Confederate Armed Forces and serve it until his dying day. However, he must do his duty in the United Kingdom first; which was to take the Dark Lord Voldemort and ensure that he will never be a threat to the world or the Confederacy. He will continue his oath to defend Virginia by fighting the Voldemort, who will want to kill all Muggle's and conquer the entire world; which is something that will never allow happening on his watch. No, he will beat the Dark Bastard and then after that, he will return to Virginia and see if he can go back to into the Confederate Armed Forces somehow."James?" He heard from being him, which from a voice of Tonks.James turned around and saw that it was Tonks."Yes, what it is that I can help you will, My Lady?" he asked with his Southern Charm.Tonks blushed as she said, "You know that today is the day that you can go to Hogsmeade, right?"James had forgotten about that. Nearby Hogwarts was a small magical village called Hogsmeade. In the village was all kinds of shops range from shop supplies all the to candy and alcohol. James would do with a nice shot of Kentucky Whiskey, he was not a drinker much, but he did like to have a little shot once in a while. However, he doubts that the Village had Muggle whiskey or even knew exactly where Kentucky is at all. So, he was not going to be sad about it. He could go to the shops and just browse around and see if there is something that he might like as well as take with him back to the castle. Usually, students would have to have their guardians sign all permission form in order to gain access and be allowed in the village. Although, seeing that his was of age to be on his own, he did not need one. Nevertheless, when the Orientation over the rules was commenced for the Hufflepuff's in the Common Room; Professor Sprott, his Head of House, tried to convince that it may not be such a good idea to go to the village. James managed to stop the Professor from telling him to not to go, by saying that he would be fine and that he would not do anything stupid. He figured that she tried to stop because of Sirius Black on the loss and with the latest rumor that Black had escaped from prison in order to kill James. James was not afraid, he already had one person try to kill him with a surprise, he was not going to allow that to happen to him again; which was why he still had his Navy Revolver with him in the side pocket of his pants."Your Right. Thank you for reminding me, Tonks. Would you like to join me? I mean, I know that your suppose to protect at all times and at every place. But I would like for you to enjoy it with me at the same time." James asked kindly.Tonks smiled. Ever since She had met him, he has done nothing but treats her like a person that belong and like as if she was a Queen. The more he acted like a gentleman, the more she could not stop herself from developing a crush on the man acting like a typical man from the Confederate States. She wished more men were like James, most of the men that she encountered were more into her Metamorphic powers. Although it was mostly during her years at Hogwarts, she still ran into men that were perverts in the Auror Department. She had actually almost decided to bat on the other team for a minute because of how all the men were treating; not that she mind being on the other team. It was just frowned upon in the Wizarding World."I'd be glad to go with you, Mr. Potter." She answered James with a bigger smile.James thought about his last. Should he go by Potter-Lee or something? He did not want to get rid of the Last name that he had in the past, but he did not want to dishonor his birth parents by replacing their last name. So which should it go? Potter-Lee or Lee-Potter? He really was not sure. They both had a ring to it. He decided that he would think about it later as the year went by, where he could then talk to the goblins at Gringotts and see what can be done in the legal documents containing his name. They would know more than the House Elves, not that he had anything against the Elves as they had treated him kindly and like his adopted parents had treated him in the past. He really cares for the House Elves, they were another set of parents that he never had. They had taught him everything that he needed to know about the Wizarding World and somethings of the political organization of the British Ministry of Magic. He understood the basics of how the ICW or the International Confederation of Wizards works like the United Nations in some ways, but he figured that the United Nations works better than the ICW. Although, he did not know why he believed that; it was just the way he felt."Is there any place that you would like to go, first in Hogsmeade?" James asked."Well, we could do Honeydukes. I do have a sweet craving." Tonks answered. She had missed going to that place ever since she had graduated from Hogwarts a few years ago and really wanted to go to it."Sure, let's go. My lady," he said with a smile, as he acted like proper gentlemen and grabbed her arm as well as escorted her to the village.Meanwhile, in a Shack that is known to shriek"Did you see him?" One man said with black hair."Yes, I did." was the answered that he received from another man in the shack with him."What was he like?" He asked with concern."He is a hard working student, and he seems a lot older than he should be. I mean he looks like to be in his twenties. Also, he likes to be called James."The man with black hair was confused. How was it that his Godson was older? His Godson should be thirteen right now; not in the twenties. He knew that he had missed a lot in life with his Godson, but not that much. Maybe, he had matured more than a typical teenager would have today. Although, he wondered if there was something that else that might have resulted in his favorite Godson to mature more than the rest of the Teenagers."Also, Harry is a fourth-year student in my class, not a third-year student. I asked Dumbledore about why Harry was a year ahead, and he said that Harry had already completed the third year material while being homeschooled. However, he did not tell me much about where Harry was the whole time, and I doubt that even he knows because before he surfaced, no one knew where he went."The man with black hair nodded as he stroked his beard, as he could help but think again that he had missed so much time with his godson because of his stupid actions. How could he have been so stupid in trying to go after that dirty and betraying rat for revenge? The first thing on his mind should have been going to check and see that his godson was alright, which was his duty as a godfather. He felt like that he had let James and Lily down. He would make up for his mistakes to them by going for the rat first and then raise Harry, himself. he would raise Harry the Marauder way, he would be the king of pranks at Hogwarts. The teachers would fear him as he pranks and humiliates the entire student population in the school; no one would dare mess with a prankster. Especially, one that was raised by a marauder. Women would want to surround his godson and more, as they would a prankster like him.He would raise his Godson to be the greatest prankster in the whole entire world.Hogsmeade VillageJames could not help but admire all the buildings inside the little village of Hogsmeade. It was like Diagon Alley, but a much calmer version. There were not the occasional idols wanting to meet for something that he did not remember. He really hated those people, they did not have any manners at all. Like as if they were not raised to be proper civilized people. Although, what was more uncivilized were those damn Dementors. He thought those demons should not be used for any individual and should instead be exterminated from the face of the earth. He sent the Minister of Magic Fedge a letter demanding that he send those monsters back after they tried to suck his soul back in the Hogwarts express on his first day of seeing the school. The Minister denied him by saying that the Dementors were there to protect him from Black. James really wanted to kill the stupid bastard. He really is uneducated to even be in a political position. How the fool even became Minister he did not know, but he really wished that there was a way he gets rid of those blasted demons from hell or else one of these days his soul will be sucked from his body.Tonks understood the anger that he had towards Fudge. Her boss, Madame Bones was always angry at the idiotic Minister as he had again cut the funding of the Auror Department. The Auror Department was always getting smaller and smaller as it was hard to get in nowadays, thanks to Snape as Aurors were required to pass an exam on potions. He seriously thought that Snape was the way he is now because he had once served the Dark Lord Voldemort. But Dumbledore, for some dumb reason, had pardoned the Snake. Snape has been severely harming the strength of the Auror Department for the return of his Master Voldemort. The bastard needs to die before he returns to Voldemort, should he rise soon.He stopped thinking about the Snake as he followed Tonks into Honeydukes. She was jubilant to be here. He could see it on her face, the was as the modern saying goes like a kid in a candy store. She could not help herself from having a glint in her eyes, which showed James how happy she is to be here in the candy store. She probably missed being here at this place and wanted to be here again."If there is anything that you want. It is on me." James told her with a grin."Oh, James. That is not necessary, I have my own money. You do need to spend anything on me." Tonks replied with a shocked face."But I want to, and it is my money. So, I can do whatever I want with it right. Plus, It would not be very gentlemen of me in not giving you something for protecting me from the evil little demons that could be after me." James said with a smirk. He really was wanting to treat her like a Lady. A lady that he cannot help but admire.Tonks nodded as she went to the candy store to browse and see what she wanted. Although, she did not want to take a lot. Even though, James was paying for it and all. She thought it would be rude and greedy to get like a whole buck full of candy and stuff. She thought of James as such a unique man, he was better than most of the men that she knew. If there was one thing that she could not stop herself from was the fact that she kept blushing in front James. Generally, she would hide her blushes very well; however, the way James has been treating made it hard for her to hide as she was blushing so much that it was hard for her to hide from anybody. She could say that James has multiple checks saying that he is a perfect man for her should she somehow develop a relationship with him. But she doubted it, as she was to protect him not fall in love and it could affect her job as well as her life. Especially, should that bitch Skeeter catch wind of it; it was just not worth the risk. Her mother wanted her to find someone to spend her life with, but Tonks was sure that she did not mean by loving the Boy-Who-Lived. Plus, she was sure that James was thirteen; which is another reason why she could not develop any kind of romance with James as it would be illegal and get her into Azkaban for a few years to maybe life. That is not a risk that she is going take as she would instead want to live free than in a cold prison with the Dementors.She stopped think about that as she finally got the pieces of candy that she wanted to take with her and saw that James had a big of candy as well. She just smiled as she saw that he was smiling as well. She really did miss Ha...James as the last time she had seen him was when he was just a baby. After his parents had been killed, no one knew where he went; not even Dumbledore knew. They did a worldwide search James but had no luck. People wanting a chance to actually see the boy who had killed the Dark Lord or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in person. But no one knew where he went or if he was even still alive. The story of the Boy-Who-Lived was made by Dumbledore claiming that the disappearance of James somehow meant that You-Know-Who was killed by James. People were unsure at first but went with it as they were happy that the War was finally over and that peace was back in the British Wizarding World. The search continued for over a year and a half as people began to give as well as admit to the idea that James was dead. However, Dumbledore did not give up as he went to Gringotts and ask if they had the location James; the answer that they gave him was that James was still alive, but they are not to disclose the location of James. This gave some hope to the Wizarding People, but there was not much that they could do as they still were not able to find James.However, when a spike of magic popped up in the Ministry recognizing the signature as James's Magic. It caused a wave of hope and joy as they felt that they had finally found James. They did want to know where James had been the entire time, but they were not able to get much from him nor from the jolt of magic that James released. She did wonder what James did that released that particular spike of magic, but she was not going to ask him as she thought that it rude of her to do that.She turned her attention to James as paid for both his and her candy, which was two bags full of godly sweetness. She did wish that he did not have to pay for hers, but she did not want to upset him if she had said no. She would look for a way to pay him back for it later somehow or someway. Slowly, they went outside to enjoy their bag of candy in the cold or somewhere quite. However, just the moment they stepped was when trouble came."Oi, Potty." came from a voice that James really wish he could shoot right now, as he knew that nothing but trouble and racism came from that mouth; which needed to be washed with soap.James turned around and saw that it was Draco Malfoy; a little boy from Slytherin that has nothing better to do with his life. He meets the little shit in the Hogwarts Express, who wanted James to be his ally and all that. However, when the shit saw Tonks, he instantly made a comment about she was half-blood from a disowned blood-traitor whore. This resulted in James give the little shit a good punch in the face and saying that if he ever said words like to a Lady then would find a way to end his life. Of course, the Little Shit was dependent on his father and stated that his father will hear about this. James really did not give a rat's ass, if the Shit was going to run to daddy in order to get revenge; he would hit again if he wanted to."What do you, Malfoy? Have you not gotten enough punches already?" James said."So, I heard that you are afraid of Dementor. Better watch out, they might be sneaking up right behind you and your slut." Malfoy said, smirking like the little shirt that he is. Then he began to laugh and snicker with his two goons, Crabbe and Goyle, who were behind him.He really was starting to tick James off, who was actually thinking of pulling out his pistol and just put a bullet into the little fucker. But he would really not get into any trouble with the law. It was then he decided to look for a legal way to put Malfoy on his ass and learn a lesson or two. He looked up to where Malfoy was standing and saw that he was near the edge of a roof. James did learn some useful spells from the House Elves and had an idea on what exactly he was going to do with Malfoy. He moved his in a direction while still having his sight on the roof above Malfoy and knew that it was working. He was aware that it was working because he could see that the snow on the roof was shaking as some of it fell to the ground. Malfoy and his goons did not notice it as they began to give more insults to him and Tonks, which had made James even angrier as he now more snow to fall on the little shit. Then more and more snow began to fall, which Malfoy started to snow as some landed on him. He then screams as all the snow that was on the roof above him and the goons began to slide and fall on top of them. The amount of snow that fell on them was so much that ultimately knocked their asses to the ground, and the only thing that was sticking out was their heads.James and Tonks chuckled as they saw the end of the show of Malfoy being buried in snow with his bastards."That should definitely cool you off, hot head," James said with a grin, as he led Tonks away from the buried Malfoy.He led Tonks to a pub called Three Broomstick in order to get some peace and quiet for once in this village. James personally escorted her to a table as he examined the interior of the pub. To say, it was quite beautiful. It was evident that a lot of hard work was put into the building of the bar. It was better than most of the pubs that James went to inside the Confederacy and Union, before the War of Independence. The place was well polished and had beautiful wood works that were all made by hand. There were plenty of tables to house at least 5 large families. He stopped looking around as he turned his attention back to Tonks until he heard someone familiar call out his name. He turned around and sighed happily as he saw that it was Jacob Freemantle with a couple of girls beside him."Jacob, how are you doing?" James asked kindly."Oh, I am doing fine. Mind if we join you and Tonks?" Jacob asked."Sure, your more than welcome to join us.""Great."Jacob went to the other side of the pub to grab a few extra chairs. He then set them up on the table that James and Tonks were sitting at. After putting the chairs in place, he let the ladies sit first as they thanked him for his kindness to them. Then Jacob sat on one of the chairs himself and decided to introduce his companions."James, allow me to introduce these ladies. This here is Susan Bones."James looked at the lady that was to the right of Jacob. She was like a piece of heaven with beautiful red hair. She had brown eyes that were hard to look away from. James remembered seeing her back in the Hufflepuff Common Room, but only a few times as he was more into his studies. However, whenever he saw her, she was always with a friend that had brown hair. He studied her face and determined that it was one of paradise like as if it was crafted by the finest sculptor in the world. She was as beautiful as a Southern Belle in his time in the Confederacy. He did learn about a little bit about the background of Susan from Tonks. Apparently, she was the niece of Amelia Bones; who runs the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Tonk's Boss below the Minister of Magic. Susan's parents were killed in the War that took him to his adopted parents and was the one of the last members of her family with her Aunt Amelia. James felt sorry for the poor girl to lose her parents and being one of the last remaining members of her family is very hard on a person's childhood as well as life." It is an honor to meet you, Miss. Bones. " James said with his Southern Accent.It accent somehow caused Susan to blushes to the shade of freshly picked rose as she said, "Please call me Susan."James nodded as Jacob began to introduce the other girl beside him."And this is Daphne Greengrass from Slytherin House. Do not confuse her with being like Malfoy, she is one of those Slytherin's that hate Draco's guts."James then turned to Daphne and saw that she had blonde hair that touched her shoulders. Lips that were as green as her house colors. Her eyes were as blue as the ocean, and her face was charming. James could not help but feel that she was actually different than the Slytherin's that were like Malfoy, as she had a serious look that strengthened Jacob's claim. Her face was one that does not deal with nonsense. Although, he did hear a little bit about the Greengrass girl. According to some of the other students in his House, she was known as the Ice Queen of Hogwarts. He did not know what the term meant at first, as this was new to him. He was aware that he should have invested in a dictionary as he still does not a lot of things that exists in this world like the telephone and radio. It actually made him feel like that he was stupid to even though he came from another time period where they were no such thing as Automobiles and machine guns. When he asked Tonks what does it mean when someone is an Ice Queen, she explained to him that it basically meant that Daphne was the kind of girl that refuses any sexual advances as well as is kind of cold and heartless at times. James wondered what would force a girl to turn toward such a path. It stopped thinking about that as he returned to the present."It is happy to meet you, Miss. Greengrass."Daphne had no emotions on her face as she said, "Thank you, just call me Daphne."James nodded."So, How has everything been treating you and Tonks?" Jacob asked."Fine. Until we ran into Malfoy." James answered."Oh boy. He is always looking for trouble. I am telling you, one of these days he will go too far and then he is going to regret being a pain in the arse. I and Daphne really wish that there was a way for us to get rid of the bastard because he is one of the reasons why Slytherin has a bad reputation. So, what did he this time?" Jacob said as Daphne nodded in agreement, while they were wondering if Draco got his ass beaten by James today."Oh, nothing, but wanting to talk shit. However, let us just say that he is on the ice right now cooling off his head." James replied with a smirk."What did you do?" Susan asked with a smile."Well, I might of have gotten rid of the snow on someone's roof and dropped it the little shit as well as his goons."Everyone was silent for a minute, until they all started laughing and loudly. They continued to laugh for an entire minute until they began to calm down. Although, the women were still giggling at a hearing of the fate of Malfoy on ice and snow. Finally after another two minute, everyone was relaxed as they ordered some Butterbeers. The drink was alright for James, it actually did taste like Butter, but it did not have a good kick that he would get from regular alcohol when he was back in the past where they were no underage drinking laws. He did not drink much, only on special occasions like a large-scale victory or when he was in mourning. His favorite alcohol was Kentucky Whiskey, it had the fire like the kick that always opened his eyes more to the world around him. He missed those drinks and wished he could get a bottle of it right now. However, he was going to try to look hard for one as there is more to life than alcohol."So, James. Forgive if I am rude for asking this, but I am curious. Where were you the entire before you came to Hogwarts?" Daphne asked.James almost spilled his drink as he let the question sink into his head. He knew that he could not tell her the exact truth, or it could cause problems. Although, he was unsure of exactly what kind of challenges or maybe consequences would happen if he told Daphne the truth. He knew that he had to lie, but he really did not like lying to women; it was not right. But when his fate depended on him keeping his life a secret then exceptions can be made for it."Well, I was in Potter Manor the entire time with the House Elves; who raised," James answered, hoping that she would accept that answer."Really, it must of have been hard for you to socialize with anyone outside of the manor," Daphne said."Well, it was for a little bit. However, the Elves always have kept me company and made sure that I was educated in the way that my parents wanted me to be. They treated me like real parents and took real good care of me." James continued."Well, it is good. Because no one knew exactly where you went. Everyone was worried that you were kidnapped by a follower of You-Know-Who or something." Susan said with relief.James nodded as he understood her concern."So, James, do you have any plans on what you want to do after completing your education at Hogwarts?" Daphne asked."Well, actually, no. Not yet, I mean. However, I might make a decision as time comes by. What about you, two ?" James asked towards Daphne and Susan."Well, I want to be a Healer. I am exquisite at charms and such to be good at the position." Susan answered with a smile."I want to work as a Potions Master, but I only want to have my own shop to sell potions and such," Daphne answered."What marvelous career ideas that you have. So ambitious. I can already see great success for you two in the future." James praised with a smile.Both Daphne and Susan blushed at his words as they looked down in order to hide their blush from the world.James looked at his watch and saw that it was time for him to return to the castle or more precisely the Hufflepuff Common Room. He had homework to complete, and he was not one to lack on his studies; he worked to achieve academic excellence. He wanted to work his hardest whenever he could."Jacob, ladies. I apologize, but I have to go back to the castle and finish my studies. I guess I will you later." James explained."No problem, James. We completely understand." Susan said with a smile."Yea, it is alright. But be careful, though, there are rumors that Sirius Black is in the area. Please watch yourself, alright?" Jacob stated with a serious face."I will. See you later." James said as Tonks followed him back to the castle.Hufflepuff Common RoomSlowly, James walked inside the Castle with Tonks as he walked to the kitchens where the entrance to the Hufflepuff Common Room was located. After entering and exiting through the barrel that leads to the Common Room, James went to a coach to relax for a bit. He felt like he should be falling asleep right now, but he was not yet as he still has some work to get done before he finally hits the sack. He went to the Boy's Dormitory to get his books and assignments, where he placed them on a table and began to work his studies.As he was doing his work, he began to think about the old days again. Of how he served his home state of Virginia against anyone that dares to threaten its existence. He wished that he could go back and be with his family again; where he could be playing with his siblings again. However, he knew that there was no turning back. He has a duty in this time period. Although, he missed the action that he had back in the Confederate Army and being surrounded by men that he saw as another family that he had during the war.However, he still could not stop thinking about what he had done at Falmouth. He wondered what would happen to him when he sees the Lord in Heaven, would he be a judge for his actions and be sent into the ever burning pits of Hell."Lord, please forgive me for the sins that I have committed at Falmouth."As he continued his studies, he did not notice that Tonks had heard say those words and wondered what exactly did he mean. Finally, I got this Chapter done. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Please leave a review about your thought over the story. In the next chapter, I will probably have James accidentally confuse his past to Tonks somehow; which could probably then result in them having a start of a beautiful relationship.Now, in the poll, here are the results of the top four winners.  In First Place, Fleur Delacour with 43 votes. In Second Place, Daphne Greengrass with 41 votes. In Third Place, Katie Bell with 27 votes. In Four Place, Susan Bones with 22 votes. Now, I have some ideas on these girls will get into the harem with James; but I would like to hear some suggestions from you guys. Also, Thank you, again, to those that took part in the poll. I do not know what else will need to voted on by you guys yet. However, when I find out something, then you will know in the next chapter. I hope to have the next chapter done by the end of next week.
