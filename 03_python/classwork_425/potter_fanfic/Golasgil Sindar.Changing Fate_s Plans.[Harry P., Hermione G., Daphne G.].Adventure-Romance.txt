Chapter 1"What can I do for you, Miss Granger." Professor Dumbledore said and motioned for her to come forward."Sir." She said stiffly and sat nervously in the chair before his great desk."Miss Granger?" he said mimicking her tone."Harry." She started but then clamped her lips closed and looked down."Miss Granger, I've sworn to not pry into your mind for information on Mr. Potter, but you asked to speak to me." He said gently.She sighed and looked up. "Yes, Headmaster, thank you again. I'm rubbish in a fight. Harry needs someone who can help him when spells start flying."Instead of answering he took a lemon drop from the bowl on his desk, popped it into his mouth and leaned back in thought.She waited patiently, having presented her predicament. Harry's inclusion in the Tri-Wizard Tournament had highlighted her own deficiencies just as much as Harry's. They needed serious help or one of these years they would be killed.Several minutes later he cleared his throat. "I believe you spent much of your third year in the company of a certain Slytherin?"She opened her mouth, but the Headmaster held his hand up and she sat back in her chair."I will discuss this with Padfoot and see if an arrangement can be made.""Yes, Professor, thank you." Hermione said and stood, not quite understanding how Sirius Black could be of assistance in this."Miss Granger." He said and waited for her to face him again. "I believe you are selling yourself short, but I do agree that a skilled combatant would be an advantage. I recommend you dedicate some of your attention to Poppy's profession, as well as focusing on defensive spells."He walked around his desk, clasping his hands behind his back. "What I am about to say, I say with a bit of trepidation, yet I feel it must be said. In all magical couples, if there is a great disparity in magical power, the weaker one becomes subordinate to the stronger. The fact that you are still your own person indicates to me that your magical abilities are well above the average. To add another to this delicate balance you have achieved will be difficult, yet I believe the witch in question is capable of it."She was only mildly surprised by this revelation. She'd delved deep into magical theory, spending hours with Professors McGonagall and Vector, attempting to understand how magic really worked. "I've never heard it stated that way sir, I suppose it makes a certain sense. We've felt our magic interacting, feeling out the balance you mentioned. I do trust her, Headmaster, thank you again." Hermione said and left. Leaving both of them in deep thought.}-{Harry Potter was extremely pissed off as he sat wasting his time on Privet Drive. With Voldemort's resurrection he knew he had to be ready to fight him as an equal. That wasn't going to happen if he spent every summer doing the chores on Privet Drive. He had managed to get into better shape, by running every morning and even visiting the local pool to swim laps. Since Hermione had taught him how to swim for the second task he'd discovered he actually liked it. Even his school books had been re-read and useful spells or strategies noted down in his new spiral notebook.He picked up Hermione's most recent letter, like everything he'd received all summer it was much of nothing. And that was the reason for his anger. Not even Hermione would tell him anything!He tossed it on his bed and lay down beside it closing his eyes in thought. Several minutes later, when he had calmed down he looked at the letter again, this time two words jumped out at him: no good.Perusing the letter a bit more carefully he found up and to in a straight line down the right edge of the page."No way." He said in a hushed whisper and snatched his wand from under his pillow.Pressing the tip of his wand to the letter he said, "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good." A broad grin finally split his face as the letter reformed to a much longer one in his friends tiny script. She had written him!Harry, I do hope you figured this out quickly, it was the only way I could get a real message out. Mrs. Weasley is monitoring everything!Yes, I'm with them, but at Padfoots. Professor Dumbledore promises me you will be picked up on the night of your birthday to come here.Now, as to what has been going on. The Daily Prophet is ridiculing yourself and the Headmaster for your stand on Voldeshorts. Madam Bones and Madam Longbottom seem to be the only prominent politicians in our corner, but the Headmaster says he is calling in favors, some over a hundred years old, to get others to side with us against the Minister.The Weasley's are trying to hide it but none of them are happy that you and I are together. They treated me normally until it came up in conversation, now they all look at me like I've stolen you. In spite of that, things were fairly quiet until a few days ago, then another girl showed up. I'm sorry I can't name her, but even here I don't think it would be a good idea.I did tell the Headmaster at the end of the year that we needed help, this seems to be his way of providing that.Officially Padfoot did something and that triggered something else, and she is here waiting to speak with you.The Weasley's, especially Ron are not getting along with her. You will recognize her immediately, but please give her a chance. I do know her and she has my trust.In fact I've switched from sharing rooms with Ginny to sharing with her to get away from the constant bickering of our red headed friends.Remember what I told you Harry, I'll never leave you.Love HermionePS, yes I mean it, of course I love you Harry.Before he could even touch his wand to the note to give the counter it crumbled into a fine dust. He brushed it off of his bed and onto the floor, thinking about the contents of the letter. What kind of help had she asked for and what had Sirius done to cause a girl to be waiting for him?And Hermione trusted her. Who precisely were his girlfriend's friends? The only one he knew outside of their house was Padma Patil from Ravenclaw, but she wouldn't cause such a reaction from the Weasleys, unless she tore into Ron about the Yule Ball?He shook his head, no that couldn't be it. He wished he could re-read the letter, but that wasn't an option so he had to use his memory. Hermione trusted this girl enough to share a room with her, instead of with Ginny. That told him she was a very close friend indeed."Guess I'll just have to wait and find out on Tuesday night and I really need to learn who Hermione's friends are." He said to his snowy owl who gave a soft bark.Harry pulled all of Hermione's letters from the drawer and looked through them for the same telltale words. They were not on the first two, but were included on the next four. Damn, she'd been sending him real messages since the first two!Sudden tears came to him and he wiped them away furious with himself now. She had been loyal to him. She had not ignored or abandoned him. He had not trusted her enough to believe in her brilliance.He would try not to make that mistake again. She had handed him some extra books when they were on the Express, he'd flipped through them but not really bothered to try and understand them. With renewed energy he decided to focus the rest of his time on them, she knew what he was up against and likely the books were part of her strategy to assist him.The first book: Understanding Wandless Magic sounded daunting. Everyone said it was nearly impossible, but he knew Dumbledore could do some, it was likely Voldemort could as well. Even if the book didn't teach him how to do it, if he understood it that could help.The second book: Occlumency for Self-Awareness did not make much sense. What was Occlumency to begin with? He gave a mental shrug at his own stupidity and opened the book to find out. An hour later he stood and stretched, pondering what he had just learned."Boy! Take the garbage out!" Aunt Petunia screamed up the stairs."Sure." He replied, just loud enough for her to hear. What was she thinking? All of the windows up and down Privet Drive were open.He stuffed an old ball cap on his head and began collecting the cans from around the house. So Occlumency was the name for a large branch of self-centered mental magic. Everything from defending your mind from external influence to organizing your thoughts to better retain information or solve mysteries. The book his thoughtful girlfriend had given him focused on the latter part of that, learning to organize your mind, ignore the distractions to see the truth in the clues you do have and understand what they meant.If she had been using this for years it was no wonder she was a walking encyclopedia. One of the games she'd played back in second year was having all of the first year students ask her questions about any of their classes, trying to stump her, they hadn't been able to. The game had not happened in third, because he and Ron were fighting with her and she'd spent most of her time in the Library. In fourth year she had joined him in being school pariahs.Once the trash was on the curb, and all of the cans were washed and back in their proper locations, he made a quick sandwich in the empty kitchen and took it, with a glass of water, up to his room to continue the book.

Chapter 2On his birthday the Dursleys went out to dinner, clearly to spite him, though no one mentioned his special day. Harry didn't care, he was leaving today. He packed quickly after they left and dragged his trunk down to the entry siting on it to wait for someone to pick him up. Then in the middle of waiting he decided he had better not be sitting there like he expected them, that would give away that someone had told him they were coming.With a sigh he dragged his trunk back upstairs and quickly unpacked some of his things, including spreading books out with the homework list, though he was well done with his summer homework.To pass the time he went back to the mental exercises in the Occlumency book. Drift, ignore the world around you and see where your mind takes you. So far it had taken him to some very memorable places he and his girlfriend had gone. This time started just like the others, Hermione showing him a new spell for him to learn, and earn a reward. Then it was different, he seemed to feel the presence of someone or something else. He tried to figure out where they might be but the bell rang and he ran downstairs. A quick look through the peephole revealed Mad-Eye, Remus and two women he didn't know.He quickly opened the door and ushered them in.Remus came in first, gave him a quick hug and stepped past, heading upstairs. "I'll fetch your things.""I sent Hedwig to Hermione a few hours ago with a letter." He called up the stairs, Moony waved to show he'd heard him.A woman with pink hair said, "Wochter!" as she came into the house. Her smile was bright and infectious.Harry wasn't sure what that meant, but he grinned at the cute woman. Then he saw the other woman clearly. She was strikingly pretty, about thirty with platinum blonde hair, and piercing blue eyes. She wore a dark green, full length robe with silver trim. It was far more fashionable than most witches wore and would have drawn appreciative looks at a Muggle mall.She noticed his stare and held her hand out to him. "Marlene McKinnon, Mr. Potter. I'm a Hit Witch."She was holding her hand out flat, her long fingers drooped and the red polished tips gleamed in the light. He suddenly realized she was expecting him to kiss her hand. He quickly made an awkward attempt, which caused her to giggle and then smile at him."McKinnon!" Moody barked as he entered and closed the door. The woman did not jump as everyone else did, she merely turned her head to the Senior Auror. "The boy's got a girlfriend." He said which only caused Marlene to smile and look back at a furiously blushing Harry.She brushed her fingers down his cheek and smiled, "But he isn't married yet is he?"Harry spent the next few minutes trying to remember how to breathe. Then Remus was back, floating Harry's trunk behind him."So how are we getting out of here?" Harry managed to ask."Apparition." Mad-Eye said."You're with me." Marlene said and stepped to his side, her fingers dancing across his strong shoulders, causing him to blush again. His heart was pounding in his chest and he was having trouble breathing.With sudden clarity he realized he was acting like she was a celebrity or famous actress. Which was precisely how he hated people treating him. That thought made him ill and he forced his heart to slow, doing the first breathing exercise from the Occlumency book to help."Merlin Marlene, you've got the poor boy all flustered. Let me have a shot." The pink-haired woman said and turned to Harry. "I'm Tonks. Well actually that's my last name but I hate my first name. Most people just call me Tonks anyway, but since we're distant cousin's you can call me Nym.""What?" Harry said in obvious confusion."This is Nymphadora Tonks," Marlene said. "Her mother is Sirius' cousin Andromeda Tonks, her sisters are Bellatrix LeStrange and Narcissa Malfoy.""oh.""So, this is how we're going to do it." Moody said while Remus shrunk Harry's trunk and handed it to him. "McKinnon is going to apparate you, but we're not going straight to our destination in case someone is trying to follow us. First we'll go somewhere together, then we'll split up and each go to several locations. She will take you around the country, for about ten minutes, then to Headquarters.""What Headquarters?" Harry asked."Here, read this." Marlene said and held a strip of parchment in front of his face, her right hand lightly on his shoulder. The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is located at number 12 Grimmauld Place, London."What?""Just memorize it and when we get there it will make sense." Marlene said into his ear, sending a pulse through him and he wondered if she was using magic on him somehow."Um, ok." Harry said again trying to calm himself and act normal. How was this witch affecting him so? Only Hermione and Cho, had ever made him feel like this."Apparition is a bit rough at first, just try not to throw up." Nym said with a chuckle bringing him back to the present."Ready?" Moody said and then Marlene was wrapping her arms around Harry from behind. He blushed again when he felt his neck snuggle between her prominent breasts."Ready." Marlene said and then Harry's world changed. They were standing atop a building in the middle of a large city and he didn't feel ill at all. There had been a brief squeezing sensation, but it was over before he'd really recognized it.The other three arrived, each holding their wands at the ready. As soon as the others realized Marlene and Harry were there he felt Marlene's arms tighten and they vanished again. This time they appeared on a beach."Why don't I feel ill like Nym said?" he asked when she didn't apparate away immediately."Because I'm far more powerful than they know, and that allows me to do it both faster and smoother." She said from above him. "Now we'll do a bunch of rapid ones then we'll be where your Miss Granger is.""Are you doing something to me?" He said and her arms tightened, but they didn't go anywhere. Instead she stepped back from him and used his shoulders to turn him around.Her eyes were suddenly hard pieces of ice. "I am a Hit Witch Mr. Potter, the youngest ever. My job is to stop Dark Lords and their minions. I have not, and will not, use magic upon you without your permission. What you may be feeling is our magic, yours and mine, interacting. You're the most powerful wizard I've ever been around, and I've only met a few witches that equal or exceed myself, your Miss Granger is one of them.""oh." He said looking down in sudden understanding. "I'm sorry if I offended you. I'm trying to learn all of this, but most people expect me to already know it.""Look at me." She asked in a much kinder tone and when he did her eyes had returned to normal. "I apologize, I too acted as though you understood what was happening and chose to instead accuse me of using a potion to attract you. What you feel, and yes I feel it as well, is merely our magic telling us that we could form a relationship."His blush was threatening to reach his toes. Again he ran through the deep breathing exercise which at least allowed him to open his eyes and look at her again. "Thank you for explaining. Will you be staying with us too?"Her left eyebrow quirked up in question but when he didn't say anything she did. "Yes, and I cannot explain why. I've been forbidden to reveal certain things until Lord Black does so. Now we must be on our way. They are expecting us.""Yes, ok." He said and turned around, putting his back to her once again.She draped her arms around his chest and the world changed at least ten times in rapid succession before there was a brief pause. "You ok Mr. Potter.""Yeah, some of those places looked interesting.""Perhaps we can visit them later." Marlene said and her arms pulled him tightly against her slim body before they apparated out again. This series was a little longer, but they ended up on the side of a gloomy street."Now think of the contents of that parchment, read it in your mind." She said and as he did the scene changed in front of him. They were now standing on the front porch of a gloomy old manor.Marlene lowered her head beside his, "Quiet now." She whispered and pushed the door open.Inside was not an improvement from outside. Gas lamps lit peeling wallpaper and threw scary shadows around the room. There were house-elf heads on the wall! She pulled him inside, then closed the door behind herself to then guide him around the corner and down a dimly lit hallway. At the end of the hall was a door with light streaming from under it.She gave him a moment for his eyes to adjust and then walked through the door with him just in front of her.Barely a second later a bushy-haired Harry-seeking missile pulled him into a hug and away from Marlene with a husky "Harry," breathed into his ear.This is what I've been missing. He thought to himself and took a deep breath of her familiar scent.

Chapter 3Though his vision was obscured by her hair he clearly heard many voices repeat his name and gave his girlfriend a tight squeeze. "I've missed you terribly Mine." He whispered into her ear before shifting her to his left arm and looking around the room.They were in a kitchen, and it appeared dinner was long done as the usual pile in the sink was gone. Mrs. Weasley seemed to want to hug him, but Hermione's possessive presence caused her to hesitate and then Sirius stepped up to him and clapped him on the shoulder opposite his girlfriend.Across the room was a long scarred table that could possibly seat a dozen. Ron was there and looking rather unhappy at how Hermione was wrapped around him. Ginny appeared to be putting on a brave face a few places away from her brother. The twins, seated on the far side, had several books and scrolls spread out in front of them, looking much like homework, but with them one was never sure."Welcome Harry." Sirius said."Thanks." He said, pulling Hermione even closer when he saw the girl she must have meant in her letter. Daphne Greengrass, was standing on the far side of the room, her eyes boring into his, a completely neutral mask making her look like a statue.That now familiar chill went through him as her magic slashed across his, going straight to his cock. He shifted Hermione to cover any evidence. She was long accustomed to its presence, and then Marlene was hugging the Ice Queen and Harry realized they looked a lot alike.With a strangled whine of, "Aunt M." Daphne broke free and marched over to Harry and Hermione. "Lord Black, can we please get the formalities over?" she said addressing Sirius."Yes." Padfoot said and turned back to Harry."What?" Harry asked while all of the Weasleys in the room looked at him like his funeral was about to be announced."Harry, I made you my heir. Officially that means that if I do not have any children then you become Lord Black. That had an unexpected consequence." He said with a quick look at Hermione."Go on, I'm not moving." His girlfriend said to his godfather. For which Harry was grateful as his semi had yet to recede, being pressed into her wasn't helping though."Yes, well." Padfoot said and then looked at Harry. "Since I'm not even engaged, nor have any children of my own, and there was apparently an outstanding contract with the Greengrass family. Had I been a decade younger it would have applied to me. Instead, Harry, meet your betrothed, Daphne Greengrass."Harry would have fallen except for Hermione's strong hold on his waist. She kissed his cheek and whispered, "It's fine Harry." In his ear.His magic seemed to spin, it was already latched onto his girlfriend providing him some stability, but it swirled around both Marlene and Daphne as though testing them.Both women reacted to it, Marlene gave him a quick smile and Daphne looked relieved, her mask slipping away briefly."To make it clear." Marlene said stepping close. "My niece is to become your Lady Black, with Hermione expected to become Lady Potter.""Damn right." Hermione said with yet another squeeze of his ribs."Um, hello?" Harry said a bit nervously. Then Daphne was holding her hand out like Marlene had earlier and he was suddenly grateful for that fumbling practice in the entrance hall of number 4.He gently took her hand and brushed a kiss across the back of her knuckles.She graced him with a quick smile and a glance at Hermione. He swore he saw her wink at his girlfriend before she turned and strode from the room. He heard her heels clicking on the stairs as she ascended them.Several Weasley's, including Ron, let out a sigh at her departure. Whether it was from fear or lust he wasn't sure. Like Marlene, Daphne was gorgeous, and exuded confidence and control. Now that he had a clue what it meant, he couldn't deny that his magic wanted her too.Though his girlfriend had said it was OK, and she had somehow started this crazy thing, he felt guilty, like he was not being faithful to the one person he knew would stand by him.The twins were suddenly in front of him congratulating him on scoring two beautiful birds. Which caused Hermione to blush brightly and look down, though her grip never loosened on his waist.With Marlene's explanation of his magic's ability to judge a witches compatibility he focused briefly on his girlfriend. She seemed to realize his attention, twisted and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. His magic seemed as happy as he was now that she was back in his arms.He wondered if she felt the same and then remembered Marlene had said she felt it and Hermione's magic was stronger than hers."Would you like any food Harry?" Mrs. Weasley asked. "We can fix something for you in a few minutes.""No, I ate quite a lot earlier, thank you though.""Let me show you your room Harry." Sirius said and pulled Harry out the door with Hermione, now clutching his hand, and surprisingly Marlene following them.When they got near a thick tapestry Marlene put her head between Harry and Hermione's and let out a soft shushing noise before backing away again.Harry had no idea what she was doing but Hermione held her finger to his lips and he got the message, be quiet near the front door.They went up four flights of stairs and found Daphne waiting for them in the hallway. Instead of the indifferent mask she was gently smiling at them. Which caused Harry to hesitate, but Hermione dragged him over to the Ice Queen."Harry, this is Daph. I trust her." His girlfriend said."Mr. Potter." Daphne said and then smiled again. "Sorry, Harry.""Hi." Harry said, not sure what was going on, though his magic seemed elated, which made his smile broader."Since you are my Heir this is your room." Sirius said and pushed open a double door at the end of the hall. It was huge and decorated in dark wood and a warm tan fabric. "And with that I'll leave you to work things out." He said and retreated from the room.Marlene shook her head and met Daphne's eyes. "I'll be just down the hall.""Yes, Aunt M. thank you." She said as her aunt closed the doors leaving them alone in the room.Once it clicked closed Hermione jumped into the air twice then hugged Daphne and turned to hug Harry again. "Sorry." She said and collapsed on the bed with a soft giggle."Um, Mine?" Harry said."She's just happy Harry." Daphne said and sat down on the bed beside the girl. "She actually arranged this.""What?""Oh, don't go confusing him." Hermione said and sat up. "At the end of last year, I spoke to the Headmaster and asked him for more help, someone who could actually hold their own in a fight. With all the trouble we get into I thought we needed it. A person we can trust, unlike Ronald who's always mad at one or both of us, who then leaves us when we need him. Anyway the Headmaster hinted at Daph, but wouldn't say her name. When I got here last week Sirius told me the Headmaster had spoken to him and then Daph arrived with her father and Marlene. Sirius and Malcolm Greengrass signed the paperwork and made it official.""But.""Yes you still get a choice Harry. The betrothal is a cover to allow her to be with us.""You're my bodyguard?" Harry asked with a raised eyebrow."Um…" Hermione said."Sort of." Daphne said. "It's within my ability yes, but more importantly I'm Hermione's friend and hope to be yours as well. In the meanwhile I am going to make sure you and Mine have a good understanding of tactics, situational awareness, and appropriate reactions and spells.""I'm rather confused but ok." Harry said and stepped back to look around the room."Harry, I'm still going to be your lover and do all the things we've been doing." Hermione said sliding to her feet. He was quite surprised when she took Daphne's hand and pulled her close beside her. "Daph and I met in our third year, we both signed up for all the classes. We shared the time turner. So while you and Ron were angry with me for the broom, she talked to me and we became good friends. I never told her anything private, but she guessed quite a lot of our adventures."Harry's face had gone pale and he turned to Daphne. "Thank you for being a friend to Hermione when I was being a jerk.""She's forgiven you so I do as well. I did tell her she shouldn't have gone behind your back, but it was too late at that point." Daphne said."So the contract doesn't mean you and I are getting married?" Harry asked her.She shook her head, causing her long blonde hair to shift in a wave. "It means precisely that. But there is a single out clause, that only Lady Potter can enact, once you officially have a Lady Potter.""The Lady Potter can cancel the contract, causing none of the breach of contract clauses to enact. She's not cold as she presents in public. It's a disguise to keep her safe." Hermione said."And being your betrothed means I cannot be denied. Anywhere you are summoned or called I can go too. Gringotts, the Minister of Magic, Detention at School, you could even be arrested and I can be with you in your cell, it doesn't matter. That will allow me to guard your back at all times, and yes I'm highly trained in combat. My aunt Marlene is the youngest Hit Witch in the world, she attained her rank at the age of 22, she is 29 now. She's been teaching me since I was five.""And just why should I trust you?" Harry said."Harry?" Hermione asked but he ignored her to stare into Daphne's eyes, his magic flooded the area around both girls. Hermione smiled, Daphne seemed to come to a conclusion as she nodded once."Mr. Potter." She said and stepped away from Hermione. She then handed Hermione her wand, and then another wand from her waist followed by a large dagger from her boot and finally a small knife he swore she pulled from her hair.Once Hermione held the arsenal she removed her outer robe and sat to unbuckle her boots. Then she stripped off her shirt and skirt, she stood calmly in front of him in just her thin white knickers, knee length white socks, and a lacy black bra, that did little to hide her breasts."My contract is very strict, as the House of Black dictates. I am yours, if I do not produce heirs within five years of our joining, not today mind you, then you are within your rights to kill me and take another wife. I accepted the contract, my magic, my life, and my heart are yours to use or abuse as you wish."He felt her magic dancing delicately around his, searching for a connection. It didn't as he was far too angry and his own magic had hardened like a shield about him.Harry saw red and was summarily tackled to the ground by Hermione who kissed him furiously until he started responding to her and his hands latched onto her breasts. She eventually pulled away and spoke while they were breathing into one another's mouths. "It is your choice, I will never leave you, but please Harry, other than you, she's my best friend. I trust her completely, as much as I trust you. So please give her a chance. I hope we spend the next hundred plus years together.""Oh, Mine." Harry said and shifted his arms to hug his girlfriend tightly to him.When he managed to look around the room Daphne and her things were gone. "Where did she go?" He whispered."Probably into our room." Hermione said and gestured to an open door on his left wall. "It's attached to your suite." She turned and kissed him quickly before levering herself to her feet and going into the indicated room.Harry lay there on his floor wondering how he got into these situations.There was a brief murmured conversation and Hermione was back, pulling him to his feet. "Get undressed and get into bed, I'll join you in a few minutes.""Is she ok?" he asked as she turned away."Yes," she said but he didn't think it was very convincing."Why is your bedroom attached to mine?""Well, actually it's the nursery, but we're fine in there. Aunt M. transfigured the furniture for us."He stared after her as she went back into the room she shared with Daphne and only finally managed to move when she was out of sight. He was just pulling down his pants when he heard a door close, a quick glance turned into a mesmerized Harry as Hermione stood there completely nude.She shook her head and walked over to him. He was still stuck, half-bent over, watching her hips and tits sway. "Come on, get those clothes off."That made him finish shucking his pants and underwear leaving him nude."You did take my advice and worked out, I like it, now into bed Mr. I've been missing you a lot this summer."Nearly an hour later, when they were drifting in post coital bliss, Hermione brought up Daphne again. "Please don't be angry.""Mine, I was perfectly happy with just you." He said with a sigh."I know you were, but we need more help, especially when spells start flying. Unless you want her aunt in our bed, she's the best option, and I trust her."The truth of her statement shocked him. His magic certainly wanted Marlene McKinnon, as apparently hers wanted him. But she was nearly twice his age, and smart, beautiful, powerful, and clearly unattached."What was that look?"With a sigh he lay on his back, she quickly moved to place her head on his chest and draw lazy figures around his belly button."Do you remember, back in school last year, when we felt our magic interacting? Well when I got here mine was happy to find yours again.""Yes, mine too. And Dumbledore mentioned that we had a balance between us where in some magical couples the weaker one becomes subservient.""I've got to be honest with you. When I met Marlene, and again with Daphne, I felt my magic reaching out to them, and theirs to mine.""Oh." His brilliant girlfriend said, her hand stilling on his stomach."I'm sorry." He said, tears leaking from his eyes."What?" She said, moving up and pulling his arm away from his face. She kissed him several times, then hugged him. "There's nothing wrong love. And I've a confession to make as well," She rushed on before he could interrupt. "My magic is connected with Daph's.""Hermione." Harry said and managed to focus on her eyes, she was close enough without his glasses. "You're in love with her aren't you?"His lover blushed and then nodded once. "After you she is the most important person in the world to me. And yes I would choose you if I have to, but please don't make me do that."He stroked his thumb across her cheek and cupped her ear to keep her looking at him. "You've more than earned my trust. If you think it's important, then yes. But I've got to get to know her, and she me, or we will never get along.""Thank you." She said and kissed him before they fell into a contented sleep.

Chapter 4Harry was woken in the morning by a gentle hand resting on his bare shoulder. He struggled for a minute to remember where he was and what had happened, then his glasses were handed to him and the beautiful blonde came into focus beside him."Good morning." He whispered."Morning My Lord." Daphne whispered where she knelt beside his bed.He suppressed his anger again and struggled to stay calm. Why was she acting like a house elf? Was his magic that much stronger than hers? "Meet me in your room in a few minutes, we need to talk." He whispered.She merely nodded and stood to walk away. That was when he realized she was already fully dressed for the day. A quick glance at the clock showed it was not quite seven in the morning yet.He untangled himself from Hermione, who remained in the arms of Morpheus, donned his boxers and a robe before heading to the open door the blonde had vanished through.It was a small room, with two twin beds, their trunks and a door to a shared loo on the far wall. Crookshanks and a smaller black cat were watching over the room from padded shelves that had been added to the walls for them. Daphne was sitting on the closer bed, her back against the wall, legs pulled up and hands clasped around them."I'm sorry if my reaction last night caused you pain. Did you get enough sleep?" he asked her, much to her surprise.She shrugged, "Not really, but I'll manage.""Daphne," Harry started, almost sat beside her and then sat on the edge of Hermione's bed to look into her eyes. "I need you to understand why I was angry. I've had most of the choices in my life made by others. Hermione simply asked for help, yet somehow that translated to a betrothal? Either it's my godfather's idea of a prank, or the Headmaster's continuing manipulation of my life. The fact that Hermione can cancel it, if we don't get along, actually is a great relief to me. I'm not into formality, and I certainly don't understand how any of this happened. But I trust Hermione, she says she trusts you so I will extend mine to you.""I understand, My Lord." She said softly, her troubled eyes watching him over her knees."No." he said. "I don't think you do. Since she said she never told you private things you do not know how I was raised. My aunt, and her husband are muggles and they absolutely hate magic and anything to do with our world. For the first ten years of my life they tried to beat it out of me. One of the side effects, is that I do not trust many people, and tell my secrets to far fewer. In fact until just now that extended to a single person.""Thank you My Lord." She whispered, and released her legs allowing her hands to clench into fists, short nails digging into tender palms."No." He repeated and took her hands, until they opened for him to hold. "Daphne, don't hide your emotions from me, and I promise not to hide mine from you.""That's very difficult My Lord." She said and struggled to maintain her control."And another thing, unless it is required in formal society, I am NEVER your lord. My name is Harry, I expect you to use it. If you wish you can even come up with a pet name for me. Like I call Hermione, Mine, which I noticed you did as well."A few fat tears leaked from Daphne's blue eyes, though she couldn't wipe them as he kept holding her hands. "Please."He shrugged. "I haven't a clue what you mean by that." He moved his hands to gently wipe her tears away and then sat beside her on the bed to pull her into a hug.A moment later and a nude Hermione joined them on the bed, also hugging Daphne. When she kissed the blonde's cheek it seemed to be her undoing.Daphne Greengrass, the strongest and scariest classmate he knew, dissolved into tears on his chest."What did you tell her?" Hermione hissed, while at the same time she caressed Daphne's cheek and hugged her.Harry shrugged. "Not sure. I told her not to call me her Lord, and that I trusted her, oh and I mentioned how the Dursleys treated me."Daphne's tears intensified and she pushed her face into his robed chest. Her hands grabbed some of the lose fabric at his sides to pull herself tighter against him just as her sobs erupted anew."Daph," Hermione said in alarm and then kissed her friend's cheek repeatedly, while Harry just held her against himself.Several minutes later the Ice Queen had calmed and turned to kiss Hermione gently on the lips. "Thank you.""What did I do?"Daphne kissed her again, just as gently, before speaking. "You got me here, with you and Harry, thank you."The brilliant brunette shrugged and giggled."Are you ok Daphne?" Harry asked."For now, yes. Thanks." She said and pulled away from him. Her makeup had run a bit, though she didn't wear much. "I'm grateful you trust me. And I'll extend my trust to the two of you. I was also beaten while growing up. Though my physical injuries were healed, I still feel them here." She tapped her head. "Aunt M. took custody of me a few years ago and I'm safe with her.""Why would anyone beat you?" Hermione asked."Because I'm not a boy so cannot continue the family name." Daphne said."And the Greengrasses are an Ancient and Noble house, like Black and Potter." Hermione said. "Now your sister has to claim Line Continuation, right?""Yes, you did pay attention." Daphne said."What's that mean?""The last daughter of a house can claim Line Continuation when she marries. That means that all of her children will belong to her maiden family, not her husbands. So for her husbands line to continue he has to have another spouse or mistress. That does not apply to us as we will both be your wives, one for Potter and one for Black." Hermione dutifully explained."Is Marlene the last of her line?" Harry asked, going pale."She is." Daphne said. "Why are you scared Harry?""He felt her magic yesterday, and yours as well." Hermione said with sudden understanding. "She'll have to be a mistress, but Sirius keeps implying he wants to date her."Daphne shook her head. "She won't date him or even be less than formal until he has at least a betrothed. She'd be much happier with us." Daphne grinned wickedly at Harry and then brushed her hand across Hermione's bare breast. "Mine, you shouldn't be nude or Harry and I will have to attack you." She added with a playful smile."I don't think Harry's quite ready for that yet, so I'll shower." Hermione said, and walked into the loo, grabbing some clothes from her trunk.Harry sat in shock, staring after his lovers fine ass. Slowly he recovered and turned to the beautiful girl sitting beside him. "Are you two…""Yes." She said softly and looked down at her hands."That's…" He said and drifted off. "I'm not sure how to feel about that so I'll shut up. I'd never tell Hermione she couldn't, um… With you, that is…"She nodded once and looked at him, but he was now looking away from her in embarrassment. "You've been her lover for months, I know you're not embarrassed by her nudity. You have every right to claim me as well, but I want to earn your trust and become friends first.""Good. I'm not about to do anything you're not comfortable with. There is no reason to do anything we're not comfortable with." Harry said and took her hand to give it a gentle squeeze. "Last night your magic tried to connect to mine, I was far too angry at the time. I'm sorry if that distressed you. I'm not trying to push you away, I just want to know more about you first."The Ice Queen slowly nodded, not saying anything."There have been four witches I've noticed my magic interacting with. Hermione, Cho Chang, your Aunt and you. Dumbledore told Hermione that if one person's magic is much weaker then they become subservient to the other. I do not want that to happen, I want you to be able to tell me when I'm being an idiot.""I don't think it will, I'm about equal to my aunt, but Mine is a bit stronger than either of us. What about Chang? Wasn't she dating Diggory?""Yes, but since I flew against her on the pitch I've been attracted to her." He moved to stand but looked at her in concern instead. "I guess I better go find my own loo and get a shower.""Thank you for your concern Harry. I'm feeling much better now, she wouldn't mind if you joined her you know." Daphne said, gesturing at the loo in front of them."Yeah." Harry said, rubbing is free hand through his hair. "I think we better make an early appearance downstairs. I need to sort out the Weasleys, especially Ron and Ginny."She tightened her hold on his hand, causing him to look at her before she spoke. "What do you mean by that?""Ron once told me he liked Hermione, we kind of kept our relationship secret during the Tournament. Not like anyone else was actually talking to she and I anyway." He paused and looked into her eyes, "Did you ignore her last year?""Certainly not." Daphne said. "I am loyal to my friends, and Hermione is much more than a friend to me.""Thank you.""So Ronald needs to be fully informed of the depth of your relationship with Mine, what about Ginerva?""She's been in love with the Boy-Who-Lived forever, and I suppose saving her life didn't help matters much."Her eyes went wide and she spoke quickly, tightening the grip on his hand. "The Chamber of Secrets." She whispered and when he nodded she continued. "I'd recommend reminding Mrs. Weasley that Ginevra owes you her life. And then point out to Miss Weasley, that you expect her to be loyal to you and do well in her classes." Daphne said."Um…""Life Debts are very serious Harry. You own her. Though you may never want to add her to your bed, you can claim her as a mistress. In the meanwhile, until you understand just what you do want, reminding her of these things will ensure she remains pure and does not gain a reputation for sleeping around.""So.""So you are not claiming anything, merely stating your desire for her to remain faithful to you and become a witch worthy of your household. If it ever becomes public knowledge that she owes you, then her reputation will reflect upon you.""Thanks, I'll have to do that."She gave him a gentle nudge with her shoulder. "Now go get dressed, in clothes from your closet, not your trunk. Aunt M. helped Hermione and I get you a new wardrobe.""Really? Thanks." He said and slid to his feet, only then letting her hand go. With a brief glance at their loo he left, closing the door as he did.

Chapter 5"So what is the Order of the Phoenix?" Harry asked when they met Marlene at the top of the stairs."Dumbledore built it to fight Voldemort in the first war, it's been reformed since his resurrection in June." The tall blonde woman said. "And yes, I'm a member of it.""Oh," Harry said and thought about that as they went down the stairs and into the kitchen.Ron was eating a mountain of pancakes while the twins looked to have finished a while ago and were now sitting back whispering intently to one another. Sirius and Remus were a few spaces from them but we're obviously listening to the twins plans while they slowly ate their pancakes and sipped coffee.Ginny was standing near her mother, apparently having just entered the room, and had a fresh plate of pancakes in her hands. "Wow Harry." She said when she saw him and nearly dropped her plate. "You look great." She added with a blush and hurried to sit at the table.He glanced down at the hem of her robe, noting it was very worn, the whole thing had faded from a Cannon orange to dull brownish orange."Harry dear." Mrs. Weasley said, wand in hand. "Where did you get such nice clothes?"Harry grinned at her, held Hermione's hand up. "My incredible girlfriend apparently conspired with my betrothed and her aunt to provide me with a new wardrobe.""But that would have cost a small fortune?" She asked.He shrugged, though Ron was looking jealous and Ginny depressed. "They won't let me pay them back, so I'm going to buy them, and Ginny a bunch of new clothes."Ron sprayed half-chewed pancakes across the table, and onto Sirius. Ginny looked happy, but then saw the expression on her mother's face and started to cry."Stop!" Daphne said in her hard, cold voice. It had the immediate affect of making Molly Weasley close her mouth and Ron pause halfway to his feet. "The Weasleys are an Ancient Pureblood family, as was Prewitt. You are well aware of the affect of a Life Debt. Do not try to deny it. Your daughter's appearance and behavior reflect upon My Lord Potter."Mrs. Weasley looked angry for a moment, then schooled her features into a scowl. "Look her young lady—""NO." Marlene barked, striding into the room and up to the Weasley Matriarch. "You know the law, and now Harry does as well. Why no one explains anything to him I've no idea. He is within his right. And this will allow you to spend that money, on your youngest son instead. I'm sure he would appreciate new clothes and perhaps a broom.""We can't afford a broom.""I'll be paying Ginny's tuition as well." Harry said firmly."What?" Ginny said, her eyes wide.Harry turned his attention to the scared girl, her fright sent ice into his veins, calming him in an instant. "None of this came out the way I wished." He walked over to Ginny and took the chair beside her. "I've just learned a few things. I'm hoping you know this already, but here goes. Since I saved your life it apparently belongs to me. I'm not about to do anything against your will, and I'm not sure what either of us want. But I will do my duty and make sure you have the things you need. In exchange I expect you to do the best you can in your classes, take whatever subjects interest you, but do good in them. And…" He trailed off with a blush."Don't develop a bad reputation." Daphne said for him, with her hand resting on his shoulder. "If you're known for causing fights, dating a lot of boys, or breaking rules, it will reflect on him.""Oh." Ginny said."Meanwhile." Hermione said levitating three plates of pancakes onto the table. "Let's eat.""You can't do magic outside of school!" Ron said."Of course I can. The Ministry can't tell what's going on in this house. In fact they don't know it exists. Right Lord Black?" She said and sat beside Harry with Daphne claiming the seat on her other side. Their hands met at the syrup pitcher, the brunette let her blonde companion take it, and she poured it on both of their plates before handing it to Harry."Well, yes." Sirius said, his own wand busy cleaning up Ron's uneaten food on himself and the table."MUM!" Ron exclaimed and turned to her in anger. He was immediately echoed by his brothers who all converged on their shocked mother.Harry just managed to keep from laughing out loud as Mrs. Weasley was so expertly distracted from the clothes discussion and surrounded by her irate sons."I've always said that she was the smartest witch of your generation Harry." Sirius said, lifting his coffee cup in salute to Hermione who blushed prettily.Remus laughed along with everyone at the table."Harry?" Ginny asked softly."We'll discuss it later ok Gin?" He said and squeezed her hand briefly."Ok." She said and went to work on her pancakes as Marlene sat beside her niece. With Mrs. Weasley so distracted, they had been able to cook their own pancakes."How did everyone sleep?" Marlene asked."Best night all summer." Harry said with a grin he couldn't keep off of his face."No Aunt M. I was not in his bed." Daphne said without looking up."But I was." Hermione said without any hesitation.Ginny blushed almost as brightly as Harry did, but he managed to laugh as well."Harry." Sirius said making him look up, fork paused in his mouth. "You make the rules in your suite. Besides one of your ladies owes you her life and the other is legally betrothed to you."The surprised Boy-Who-Lived looked at his girlfriend and she nodded, quite happy to fully belong to him.Which she said a moment after she washed her pancakes down with some pumpkin juice. "Of course you own me Harry, though I've got a good claim on you for saving your life a few times too.""I have to admit that I didn't sleep too well." Sirius said, "but I didn't have a lovely girl to snuggle with either.""No Sirius." Marlene said. "You have a long way to go before I even consider you worthy of my attention."Remus laughed and shoved Sirius. "And if that doesn't give you enough incentive to stop getting drunk all the time, nothing will."Sirius looked like he was actually in pain for a moment before turning to his friend. "Lock the cabinet and hold onto the key.""Ohh," Marlene cooed. "The scoundrel takes a step forward.""Aunt M." Daphne said sharply. "Don't tease the Lord Black. And Harry, even if he does have children it does not break our contract. The only thing that can do that is Lady Potter rejecting it. And you've got to marry her first.""But what family would your children belong to then?" Hermione asked. "Would they be Greengrass?""No." Marlene said. "They would still be Black's, as though they were Sirius' brothers children. And I apologize for referring to Regulus." She added when Sirius flinched.He waved dismissively at her, "He was a Death Eater. I'll not feel sorrow for one of his followers.""Well that gives us something in common Lord Black." Daphne said and then explained it before anyone could ask. "I had an older brother, he was also a Death Eater. Moody killed him a few years after I was born."Into the silence that statement generated, a Ministry owl landed on the table. Hermione went white in fear, Sirius removed the letter from it and it flew out the back window."Hmm, that's weird. Harry do you have your wand?""Yeah, right here." He said, pulling it from his wand sheath on his arm and casting a quick Lumos."What's this?" Mrs. Weasley asked, having been drawn to the owl's arrival."Well somehow the Ministry thinks Harry cast a Patronus two minutes ago on Crescent Walk."Hermione, who'd recovered when the letter wasn't about her, snatched it from Sirius' hand. She and Daphne read through it carefully."But he's been here!" Mrs. Weasley exclaimed in confusion.Remus stood, brushing some crumbs off his shirt. "I'll let Dumbledore know. He'll sort it out." He finished his coffee, took the letter from Hermione, and headed out the back door.The concerned brunette took Harry's hand. "It looks official.""Well we know he didn't do it." Sirius said, "And Dumbledore is the head of the Wizengamot, I'm certain he can sort it out.""So the levitation Hermione cast made the Ministry think Harry cast something different in a completely separate location?" Ginny asked."Well no, that wouldn't make any sense at all." Hermione said. "Could that happen?""I don't see how." Sirius said. "Even bonded couples never have that happen."Hermione took Harry's hand briefly, "I'm sorry if I got you in trouble."The Boy-Who-Lived just shrugged. "I'm with Sirius on this. Sounds like a frame up to me.""The Minister for Magic has been ridiculing both yourself and Dumbledore in the paper." Daphne said and then forked the last bite of her pancakes into her mouth. "Those were excellent pancakes Mrs. Weasley."Mrs. Weasley looked shocked at the compliment from the Slytherin girl. "Well thank you. I always try to find the best receipt I can.""You should publish them in a book." Daphne said and turned to Hermione where Harry saw her give a quick wink, which caused Hermione to cough into her hand to cover a laugh.}-{After breakfast, the non-Weasleys headed into Lord Black's study. The room was just off the landing on the first floor and behind a solid door, carved with the family crest. Inside it was decorated in dark wood with gold trim and red velvet. Daphne insisted Ginny come along as she and Harry still needed to talk. Marlene slipped inside just before Sirius closed the door. No one protested her presence.Sirius sat behind the large marble-topped desk and opened one of the bottom drawers. "Here is your Heir Black ring Harry." Sirius said and handed him a thick platinum ring with the Black family crest. "Put it on your ring finger of your right hand. We'll visit Gringotts today and get your Potter ring."Harry shrugged and slipped it onto his finger. It flashed and resized, sending a jolt of magic into him."And here is Miss Greengrass' betrothal ring." Sirius said, handing Harry another Black-crested ring. It was slimmer than the one he now wore, but had a sapphire on either side of the crest."What?" Harry said, looking at his godfather in shock."You give it to her to wear, and eventually replace it with a wedding ring. You might have to wait until she is of age to give one to Hermione, though special circumstances might alter that.""Oh." He said and turned to Daphne. His heart was drowning out his hearing so he took a minute to do several of the deep breathing exercises and got it under some control. He was putting a ring on a girl's finger! The thought sent his heart pounding again and he glanced into her eyes and flinched back.The Ice Queen looked every bit of her famous name, and then she softened her pose. "Sorry," she said. "It's a habit when I'm scared."His heart had nearly stopped at that look directed at him, it resumed at it's normal pace a second after she relaxed. Merlin she could kill with her eyes… He thought and finally got himself under control."You're scared." Ginny said as Hermione hugged Daphne tightly.Hermione was looking intently into his eyes, she gave him an encouraging smile and he felt her magic pull him closer to them. A quick step forward and brought his hand up to gently hold Daph's left."Yes." Daphne admitted. Still in Hermione's arms as her eyes followed the ring in his hand. "On the ring finger." She added when he hesitated.He slipped it onto her finger, holding his breath. It flashed as his had, sending a pulse of magic through both of them. It didn't actually hurt but made them both freeze for a second in surprise."That did it." Sirius said."Did what?" Hermione asked."Put her on the tapestry beside Harry." He answered, pointing at the Black family tapestry he had moved to hang in this room."Excellent." Marlene said and kissed the top of Daphne's head. "A word of warning, that ring can morph into an Engagement band, the stones will grow and change to diamonds. It will happen when you both decide your relationship has progressed sufficiently. Now we need to let them have a private discussion Lord Black.""But this is my office." He protested."And will prevent anyone but yourself from opening that door to enter, though it will not stop them from exiting." She continued and motioned him towards it.Harry nodded to his godfather who finally stood and left the room with Marlene right behind him.Hermione and Daphne moved a bit farther away, but remained standing, whispering softly to one another, each kept a hand lightly touching the other."Harry?" Hermione asked to get his attention."Yeah?""Daph and I are going to get ready, don't come up until 9, ok?" His girlfriend said.Harry looked at the clock, that was nearly an hour away. Then he had a sudden realization. "Um, sure." He said and they left the room."What are they going to do that will take them an hour to get ready?" Ginny asked."I'm trying not to think about it." Harry said turning his attention to the young ginger. His magic seemed completely indifferent to her presence and he had no idea what that meant. Was her magic too weak? He didn't think so, she did well in classes. Was she just too young? All of the witches that his magic had reacted to were older than he was, Marlene by fourteen years!"Why?" She asked, then her eyes went wide. "Oh!""I'm sorry if I scared you Ginny." Harry said to change the topic and walked a few feet away to sit on the heavy leather couch. His attention was drawn to his ring while he waited for Ginny to recover. What would the Potter ring look like? He wondered.It took her a moment to get her mind back on what they were discussing. "I think I'm getting it now." She said. "I panicked when I thought you were going to claim the debt. Mum warned me that you could take me out of school and make me have sex with whomever you wished for the rest of my life.""Merlin no." Harry said in shock. "How could she be so cruel to you? Have people actually done that?"She shrugged, tears leaking down her face."Ginny, I'm not going to do that." He said plainly to make her understand. "I've got the only lover I've ever wanted. And at some point her girlfriend will be joining us as well."She looked at him in shock, finally gaining control of herself again."Here is what I envision for the future. You graduate, find someone to fall in love with and get married. Or not, and follow some career path, like playing Quidditch. I'll ask your favorite team to give you a tryout. I'm sure my name has to be worth that."She sat in shock for a moment and then gave him a quick smile. "Thank you. No one ever told me that what I do can reflect on you. I'm sorry if I disappointed you over the last two years. I promise to improve.""But we still need to get you a new wardrobe and I've got to tell Gringotts to pay your tuition from my vaults. I'm going to setup an allowance for you to buy some things for yourself or gifts for others, if you want any one item that costs more than a few galleons, ask me about it first. If you abuse it then I'll take it away, but I want you to be able to buy yourself new clothes once in a while. You're not responsible for your school things out of that money, it's for things you want, not what you need. And if something embarrassing comes up talk to Hermione, if she says it's ok I'm not going to argue, no matter how much it costs. When is your father here next? I'd like to speak with him about all of this." Harry said."Wow, thanks Harry." She said, suddenly a bit breathless at the thought of her own money. "He and mum are still sleeping at the Burrow, but they usually eat dinner here." She said."OK, if you see him let him know I want to speak with him. You can explain as much of this as you like, it isn't a secret from your parents. I will tell your mum I'm very disappointed that she would think so little of me that I would be capable of what she suggested."Then the house shuddered and a wailing emanated from somewhere.Harry was out the door and sprinting upwards before he even thought about it.

Chapter 6Ronald Weasley was so ticked off he didn't care if he got in trouble with his mum anymore. He was going to get his girl no matter what bloke stood in his way, he could use magic!In a red haze he went to the fourth floor and jerked on the door to the Heir suite. It shook, but didn't open, so he pulled his wand out and hexed it. There was a bang, but the door stayed closed.He hammered his fists on it, screaming. "Come out here you hussy. You're mine!"The door flew inward, the fabled Ice Queen stood there, in a bathrobe, and apparently nothing else as her feet were bare. Behind her he saw his quarry, also dressed in a bathrobe, there was smeared red lipstick on her neck.Merlin! He'd take them both! He thought at the sight."You are not welcome here Moron." Ice said in her most imperious tone."I'm not yours." Hermione said firmly into a gap in Ron's heavy breathing."I was there. It was my spell that knocked the troll out!" He rallied, though his leg was warm from the piss running down it."No." Ice said. "You caused her to be there, therefore a Life Debt cannot be formed. Go away!""No!" He said, but took a step back when her wand-tip glowed red."I am the Betrothed of Lord Black's Heir. This is his suite. She is under my protection. I am within my right to defend her.""Eat slugs!" he shouted and shot the spell at her.Her wand flicked, summoning a shield to block it. But when the spell hit the shield the whole house shuddered. A bolt of magic shot from the Black family crest over the doorway and Moron was engulfed by it. A loud wailing started from the stairway.When they were able to look, Moron was a six foot long grey slug. It wavered for a second balanced precariously on its thin tail. Then it toppled sideways and crashed into the floor.The Ice Queen held her wand high, red-painted lips smiling coldly. "I warned you Moron." She said and conjured a stone pen about ten feet in diameter and four feet tall, to contain the thing until it could be dealt with. She contemplated conjuring some salt, but demurred.There was shouting from the twins on the second floor, "Is it Death Eaters?" The loud wailing continued from the base of the stairwell.Hermione cast a cleaning spell on herself, then on Daphne to make them a bit more presentable. A second spell made their hair wet, removed their nail polish and makeup. She was pointedly ignoring her former friend as he squirmed in a pool of slime and his own refuse.}-{Harry arrived on the fourth floor, shot between the yelling Molly and Sirius, then skidded around a stinky stone enclosure, just missing the twins who each held a salt shaker for some reason, and into his suite. Hermione and Daphne were standing a few feet inside, wearing bathrobes, long wet hair plastered to their backs.Marlene was speaking with them and gracefully stepped from his path as he snatched his lover into a one armed hug and then pulled the Ice Queen against them with his other arm. Both girls quickly added their arms to the three-way embrace.The Hit Witch glanced out the door, made a gesture with her hand and pushed the doors closed with a wandless charm. Before they clicked closed she joined the hug, whispering into Harry's ear. "They're fine, they were in no danger, this house will protect you.""I…" he started but trailed off.Hermione kissed him firmly, one of her hands grabbed the back of his head to hold him in place, and he settled down immediately. When she pulled back he was ready to listen. "It was Ron. He tried to break in and kidnap me. Then he cast his slug vomiting hex, but Daph shielded it, and the house turned him into a giant slug.""Really?" Harry asked his eyebrows vanishing into his long fringe."Did you miss him in the stone pen?" Daphne asked."I guess so." Harry said and glanced at the closed doors, beyond Marlene's shoulder."They don't need you out there." Marlene said calmly. "Lord Black will sort it out. He is the only one who can reverse it anyway.""I want him away from her." He said, his chin twitching to Hermione."I will inform Lord Black of your wishes." Marlene said formally and slowly pulled herself from their arms.Harry hadn't realized it, but he and Daphne, were holding her fairly tightly."Thank you Aunt M." Daphne said.Marlene slipped into the hall, closing the door behind herself, quickly cutting off the arguing going on, and the wailing, which continued from below."Come sit." Daphne said, pulling them towards the fireplace."So the two of you were in the shower?" he asked when they got to the couch.Crookshanks and the small black cat ran out from under the couch when Harry sat making him nearly jump back to his feet. The cats went to their respective owners."Well not really." Hermione said scooping her long-legged familiar into her arms. "This is so everyone else thinks that.""What…" he started but then blushed and drifted off."Yes, we were 'involved' when we were interrupted." Daphne said as her cat rubbed on her bare ankle."Sorry." Harry said, covering his red face with his hands.Hermione shared a look with her lover, put Crookshanks down and shucked her robe to straddle his lap.Harry squeaked, but his hands came free from his face to allow his arms to hold her close."Love, you can see me naked anytime." Hermione said. "Now calm down.""Ron is supposed to be our friend." He said bitterly."No, I don't think he really is." Daphne said, sitting beside him, moving her kitten to her lap. "Look at all the times he's fought with Mine, over her trying to help him or get him to do what he was supposed to do anyway. And then he pushed you into that fight with her over the broom, and didn't believe you were forced into the tournament. No, he's petty and jealous. I'm sorry, but it's what I see.""No, he was my first friend." Harry said, but his voice lacked conviction as he turned to Hermione."I have to agree with Daph. Most of the time he and I barely tolerate one another." The brilliant brunette said softly and then pressed a kiss to his famous forehead. "I am your first friend and Merlin himself couldn't pull me from you."He didn't say anything, clearly overcome with emotion. She shocked him out of it by changing topics. "You don't need to be embarrassed when we talk about sex. We've nothing to hide from you, I just think it's a bit too much for you right now. If you want to join in, neither of us will complain.""No, I…" Harry said, looking between Daphne who sat calmly beside them, still wearing her robe and the nude girl in his arms. "I think you're right Mine. I don't really have any problem with the two of you doing… it… but I need to be more comfortable with your beautiful lover first."Daphne blushed at his comment and turned her attention to scratching the jet black kitten behind its ears."I'm not lying." He said quickly to the blonde. "I've always thought you were pretty, most of the school does, which I suspected was why you were so cold and indifferent to begin with."She nodded, her cheeks pink. "Yes, thanks.""So I'll step out, clear our patio, and head to the library for a while.""No." Hermione said and kissed his cheek. "We're out of time. We'll be ready in about fifteen minutes to head to Gringotts.""You owe three girls some shopping." Daphne said gently placing her purring kitten on the couch beside her."Do you think your Aunt would be upset if I got her something as well?" Harry asked."She'd love it." Daphne said and suddenly leaned in and gave him a quick kiss on the lips before standing and holding Hermione's robe for her to put on.

Chapter 7The hallway had changed again. The slug pen was gone and in its place Marlene was sitting on a stool, inspecting herself in a small mirror.Harry was about to comment that she looked perfect, when a voice came from the mirror."I found the report. Looks like Fudge is pushing this personally. Thank you for bringing it to my attention, and yes, you're still on your own.""Not a problem Ma'am, my niece is adequate backup.""Consider her deputized, if you believe it is necessary. Were you with Mr. Potter when this supposedly happened?""Yes Madam, I began guarding him at six last evening and he has spent the night in a manor under my guard.""Then I don't know what Fudge hopes to accomplish. You'll tear him apart if it comes to trial. For the record you have my full support. Very well McKinnon, I'll let you know what I discover.""Thank you Madam Bones." Marlene said and snapped the small mirror closed before turning to Harry, who was looking angry."Who was that?" He said, barely maintaining his control."My boss Madam Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement." Marlene said."I don't like people spying on me." He said, though not as angrily as before."I have not spied on you Harry. I informed my boss of the underage magic notice you received. I have told her nothing else about where we are or what is happening." She slid from the stool to stand in front of him, not showing any sign of tension as she faced the angry wizard and his flaring magic."I believe you do not know just what it means to be a Hit Witch or Wizard. There are only a few of us, less than a dozen currently. Our job is to investigate anything we believe might be nefarious or dark in nature and stop it. Typically those are very dangerous activities so we are the most highly trained and respected among Law Enforcement. Previously we were known as War Witches and back in the day of the Founders, Battle Mages. Many members of my family have dedicated themselves to eradicating evil. Father always said that we are the bloody tip of the spear of light. We shed our blood to allow others to live in peace. Ending this threat is both my job and my responsibility.""Oh." Harry said, now understanding more of the beautiful woman before him. He was both humbled at her conviction and glad that at least one adult was not waiting for him to kill Voldemort and his followers."Now, you were about to speak when Madam Bones surprised you. Do you remember what you wanted to say?"Harry blushed, he certainly remembered it. His tongue seemed to stumble a moment as he made some noises, but nothing intelligible emerged.Marlene took his elbow and guided him into the suite to the left, carelessly waving her free hand and conjuring a floating sign that said 'Harry' with an arrow pointing to the door. "I believe this is not a conversation for the hall, and I must fetch my robe for our outing anyway."Her suite was small compared to his, but still larger than his Aunt and Uncle's room at Privet drive. She walked to a tall wardrobe, its doors wide open, showing several expensive looking dresses and an ash grey robe.He turned his back, facing the door instead."My robe will go over what I am already wearing, there is no need to concern yourself Harry. Now, what were you going to say?"With a sigh, he turned to face her. The Gryffindor in him demanded he do no less. "I was going to say that you looked perfect as you always do."Marlene blushed. "Harry…" She breathed in a fairly husky voice that sent chills down his spine and right to the base of his cock. A moment later she was in front of him, the grey robe over her arm and a hand lightly on his cheek. "I do not wish to anger your witch, but I must make an admission to you. Back at your aunt's your magic was violent and full of desire, yet not uncaring. Since your witch has, um… 're-connected' with you, it is now far more loving and warm. It is this, more than anything that draws me to you. Single Wizards like your godfather, the twins and Ronald, emanate lust which I have had my fill of. If you continue to compliment me, and your magic embrace me, I will stop resisting and, as the saying goes—push back."She paused, removing her hand from his cheek, but continued looking into his eyes. "Thank you for the compliment, I am happy you feel that way."While he tried to recover from that statement she stepped a few feet away and put the robe on, as soon as she did, it began to change, runes stitched in gold thread appeared in columns all over it, and the trim around the hood, sleeves, and hem became blood red."These robes are rarely seen, but I dare say that I will now gather as much attention as yourself while we are shopping. Only Hit Witches and Wizards wear such combat robes. Now as I'm certain you are curious as to what happened with the slug. Lord Black transformed your friend back, and then the three of them left with his belongings.""Former friend." Harry said firmly. "He tried to kidnap Mine. What happened with the twins and Ginny?""I told her to change for our trip to Diagon and wait in her room. The twins were almost taken back to the Burrow as well, they were sprinkling salt on the slug, causing it pain. And are currently trying to set up a prank on me, though it will fail miserably unless I allow it. I'm debating turning it back upon them, but I do not believe I wish to see them naked."His anger spiked violently at that but before he could speak there was a quick knock on the door and Daphne walked in, Hermione on her heels. The Ice Queen took one look at her aunt's robe and spun back into the hallway."Are we ready then?" Hermione asked, her eyes following her lover. Both girls had their hair braided and up on their heads leaving their necks deliciously bare."Just about, we need to collect that ginger-girl from her room." Marlene said, as she closed the last few buttons on her robe."I'll get her." Hermione said. "What happened to Moron?"Harry laughed at the new name for their former friend.Hermione grinned at his response. "Daph came up with that, perfect isn't it?""Lord Black returned him to human form, and his mother left with him and his possessions. Sirius decided to accompany them to wait to speak with Mr. Weasley." Marlene said as Daphne came back into the room.She had added a grey stole over her shoulders, like her aunt's robe it had gold runes on it and a red border."Harry, Hermione," Marlene said to call their attention to her. "This robe is the symbol of my job, we rarely wear them in the open, as it is often best to walk unnoticed. When I put the hood up my face will be concealed. I am likely to draw more attention than Harry on our shopping trip. The stole Daphne is wearing is similar to my robe and designates her as my apprentice.""Um, ok." Harry said. "So is anyone else coming with us?""No, I don't believe so. Mr. Lupin was planning on it, but he has not returned from going to see your Headmaster about the letter. I will not take responsibility for the twins behavior, at Gringotts or in the shops. It would not be prudent for your godfather until he is cleared, and he departed to explain the situation to Mr. Weasley. Harry, since you are already accused of underage magic, do not cast anything unless we're under attack, Hermione the same goes for you. With the stole, Daphne has more leeway.""Let's collect Ginny then and get started." Harry said and headed out the door."Merlin," Ginny said when she opened the door a minute later. "You're a Hit Witch!""I am, are you ready to go?" Marlene said.Harry noticed that Ginny had changed into her 'better' clothes and immediately felt sympathetic, having been forced to wear his cousin's hand-me-downs until this morning."Hermione, I'm sorry my brother is an idiot. I have no excuse other than that for his behavior and I'm ashamed to belong to the same family.""We cannot choose our family, only our friends." Daphne said with surprising sympathy as they headed to the front door.Marlene stopped them at the top of the stairs. "Stay quiet until we are all on the porch.""Why are we always whispering near the door?" Harry asked."The thick tapestry by the stairs conceals Padfoot's mothers portrait, she tends to yell obscenities or just wail as she did earlier when Daph was attacked." Hermione explained."Oh," Harry said.Once they were waiting outside they gathered in a circle."I will side-along apparate all of us. It might be a little rough, but is well within my power." Marlene said and pulled the hood of her robe up to conceal her face. With that action the robe also became fully active and they could feel it radiating magic. "Join hands, remember only Daphne and I will use magic. Do not use my name." Her voice was also different.The five joined hands and were gone a moment later.Harry definitely felt a little ill when they arrived. It was not nearly as smooth as the ones last night, but it was over in a second or so. He didn't recognize where they were, but this wasn't the Alley as they were inside a building."If that's your rough apparition, your smooth must be like taking a step forward." Ginny said. "My parents make me very ill when it's just me with them.""Thank you Ginny. We are in a Ministry controlled building near Gringotts Bank. The journey in the Alley will be about a hundred meters." Marlene said. "Daphne will be rear guard, I will lead, the rest of you stay in the middle and no running off."She tapped her wand to the stole on Daphne's shoulders, it shimmered and vanished. Once they all nodded she headed to the door and out into the center of magical commerce in Great Britain.The door itself was under a notice-me-not charm so they seemed to just appear in the Alley. The majority of the hundred meters was done in complete silence as everyone around them paused to stare at the Hit Witch leading a group of teenagers. Marlene was a very tall witch, with her usual three inch heels she topped six feet, but there was no mistaking her for a man as her robe did little to hide her curves.The goblin guards snapped to attention and stopped an old wizard from stepping in their way as they climbed the stairs and into the cool interior of the bank. That seemed to wake the stunned shoppers. Several darted off, to tell others about what they had seen, many more gathered and began speculating as to who the group was. They soon figured out that none of them had actually focused on the teenagers.Marlene strode to the Special Services desk. She said, "Potter," to the goblin seated there, and after a stunned moment the well-dressed being leapt from his perch and ran deeper into the bank, gesturing wildly for them to follow him.Since most of the witches and wizards inside the bank were still processing the fact that a Hit Witch was standing in the bank, the teens again went un-recognized.The goblin led them into a well-appointed office. "Please take seats. I will summon your account manager Lord Potter." He said in a crisp voice to Harry and then ran out the door they had just entered through."Well, he's excited." Harry said and sat in the middle of the couch.Hermione slid tightly against his right side, taking his hand in hers and intertwining their fingers. She was clearly not worried what the Goblins would think.Ginny sat about a foot to Hermione's right, carefully trying to sit properly and calmly.Marlene remained standing near the door, she looked very imposing with her hood covering her face.Daphne, after watching her aunt for a moment, sat on Harry's left, crossed her legs at the knee and kept her back firmly erect.When Ginny saw how she was sitting she tried to mimic it before giving up and returning to her former pose. She also resolved to ask for help, terrified she would embarrass Harry in some way by being ignorant.A group of goblins came to the door, but stopped abruptly when they saw the Hit Witch in the doorway."Identify yourselves." Marlene said in her magically altered voice."I am Senior Account Manager Gluge, I am responsible for House Potter, and this is my office.""I am Clan Overlord Ragnok, and this is my bank.""You may wish to have the Black account manager present as well." Marlene said and then stepped out of there way, and in front of Harry while they made their way inside. Ragnok barked something at an attendant in their language and the creature ran back the way they had come.Hermione was in a mild shock, according to all of the books she'd read, no one acted like that to goblins in their own bank. Wars had been started over less. Beside her Ginny was even worse, she was actually shaking in terror, Overlord Ragnok was never seen by humans outside of his own office unless war was imminent. The brunette placed a hand on the ginger's leg and gave a gentle squeeze.After Gluge took a seat behind his desk, and Ragnok sat in one of the tall chairs beside it, Marlene shifted to Harry's right, leaving Daphne the closest to the door."We have been sending you letters since your eleventh birthday." Ragnok said. "We did not hear of your initial visit with the Keeper of the Keys until after you had left.""I've never received any mail from Gringotts, Overlord Ragnok." Harry said, strangely calm in the face of this news."I'll have a summary of your account ready before you depart." Account Manager Gluge said while his Overlord tried to figure out how to react.Before that became an issue another goblin stepped into the doorway. "I am the Black Account Manager Axehand." He said, looking at the Hit Witch across the room.He only moved when her hand gestured for him to proceed. He turned the other high-backed chair around and sat beside his Overlord. "Ahh, I see why I am here." He said a moment later, gesturing to the rings on Harry and Daphne's hands."Lord Potter." Overlord Ragnok said. "Tampering with a Gringotts owl is a serious offense. Rest assured we will seek who has been preventing us from communicating with you.""I would start with Albus Dumbledore." Marlene said, shocking everyone in the room. She explained herself a moment later. "There is a mail redirection ward over the muggle home Lord Potter has lived in, the signature was his."Overlord Ragnok stood and bowed to Marlene. "The Nation thanks you War Witch. We shall ask for an explanation and the immediate delivery of our held mail.""Are you here to claim your ring?" Account Manager Gluge asked, as his Overlord sat."I am." Harry said, "Among other things.""While I have your ring box fetched please list your needs." Gluge said and wrote something on a pad, the top sheet then folded itself into a bird and flew out the door."On my right is the future Lady Potter, Hermione Granger. I wish to give her a betrothal ring, but as she is muggle-born I will settle for whatever you recommend. She is to have full access to my account and is my beneficiary at this time."Hermione turned to look at him and they shared a brief stare before she gave him a nod and looked back to Overlord Ragnok.Harry paused and held up the Black Heir ring. "I have recently been made Lord Black's Heir. To my left is my Betrothed for that family, Daphne Greengrass. Since I have no access to the Black vault I wish to set up a monthly stipend for her. It will allow her to live comfortably should anything happen to myself, and adjust to care for any children we have together."Daphne took a sharp breath, barely parting her lips, it sounded like a hiss.Harry continued after taking her hand with his. "On the far side of my Lady Potter is Ginevra Weasley, she owes me a Life Debt, I will pay her Hogwarts tuition for the remainder of her time in school. Also a monthly stipend is to be set up for her, with Hermione having ultimate rights to manage it. I place no restrictions on Lady Potter's power over my account or any of the statements I've just made.""Harry." His witch said, then kissed his cheek gently after they shared a long look.Marlene remained completely motionless and silent the entire time, vanishing into the background.A goblin came running down the hall and paused at the doorway, he held a box in both hands and was trying to catch his breath to announce himself."This is Griphook, a minor teller." Gluge announced for the young goblin and motioned for him to place the box on his desk.When the teller had left the room, Gluge addressed Harry. "Thank you Lord Potter. Is that the extent of your needs at this time?""To my knowledge, yes, but my ladies may discover something I did not know I need."That earned a quick look from both the blonde and brunette, though neither spoke up, while he grinned broadly at his own cleverness."Let us start with the donning of the Lord Potter ring." Gluge said.Overlord Ragnok stood and picked up the box Griphook had delivered. He ran a claw over the lid and it snapped open. Inside were well over a dozen rings."There are rings assigned to the first four children of the primary line as well as the Lord, Lady and two Consorts. In addition to the betrothal and promise rings." Gluge said.Ragnok removed the largest ring and passed it to Harry. "It goes on your left ring finger." He said as Harry took it.The ring was gold, with the Potter crest carefully engraved in it, six diamonds were arranged in pairs, the pairs forming a triangle around the crest.Daphne moved his left hand closer to the ring, as he was still holding hers.It flashed and resized as it touched the webbing between his fingers. "Greetings Lord Potter." Ragnok intoned, swiftly echoed by the other goblins in the room."As to your witch." Gluge said, nodding to Hermione. "Without a Lord of her family to sign an agreement the strongest ring is merely a Promise Ring. Even with that we can give her the access and permissions you spoke of. When she reaches her seventeenth year, she can accept whatever ring you then offer her.""Yes." Hermione said softly and Harry gestured to the box Ragnok still held in front of them.The Overlord of the Goblin nation hooked a ring in the middle of the box out with a claw and held it towards Harry. It was considerably smaller than his, but only slightly thinner than the one Daphne wore for House Black."Hermione, I wish I could make this the Lady's ring at this time, but ask you accept this token and promise of our future.""I do, Harry." She said, well aware of her chosen words, and held her left hand out to him. He quickly slid the ring on her ring finger, it resized with a brief flash and then flashed again. There was a corresponding flash in the ring box and a larger ring appeared on Hermione's finger."Oh," Gluge said. "You should have mentioned you had been intimate. She is now your recognized Consort, which yes, can be promoted to your Lady when she is of age.""What rights does a Consort have over the promise ring?" Hermione asked."Well, the Lord cannot be denied 'access' to you." Ragnok said without any hint of emotion in his voice, while the teens all turned red. "When in school that means you would share his bedchamber, there are Lords suites and he should have one, especially with a Betrothed. She cannot be denied access to him!"The teens laughed at the way Ragnok said that and calm returned to the room."We will need a small sample of everyone's blood to set up the stipends and permissions as you requested. Should you wish to make purchases in any Wizard establishment they will accept your rings pressed into the bill as payment. Your betrothed and consort can also use that to spend the money placed in their stipend. For Miss Weasley, I recommend a Ward ring for House Potter."Ragnok pulled the smallest ring from the box and handed it to Lord Potter."It goes on the ring finger of the right hand." Gluge said.When Marlene suddenly stepped forward everyone except Daphne jumped, having forgotten her presence. The Hit Witch ignored them to take Ginny's elbow and move her to kneel before Harry. She bent her hood beside the surprised ginger who listened to what she said and then nodded.She held her right hand up, near Harry's knee though not touching him, and waited.Marlene retreated and became motionless again.Harry shook himself and then placed the ring on Ginny's right hand. "Thank you My Lord Potter. I shall do my best to bring honor to your house." She said and moved back to her place on the couch after the ring resized."Here are your account statements as well as a list of properties and interest held in businesses." Axehand said, bringing the ledger that had just appeared on his colleague's desk to Harry, who immediately passed it to Hermione."I'd like a thousand pounds for myself, and five hundred for my consort. Also a hundred galleons for my betrothed and thirty for my ward."Gluge wrote on his pad, another bird formed and flew out the door. "Griphook will prepare them. Is there anything else?""Passports, and a credit card?" Hermione asked."The Goblin nation does not deal in plastic, or letters of credit." Ragnok said firmly. "Your account managers can assist in providing muggle identification at need." He then closed and placed the ring box back on the desk."Miss Greengrass, the McKinnon vault is 'restless' for its proper owner. If your aunt cannot be persuaded to accept her legacy, could we pass it to you?" Ragnok said to Daphne."No Overlord." Daphne answered without looking in her aunt's direction. "Aunt M. Sealed them inside until she needs them. I will not circumvent her direction. She is well aware of the coming war, and stands at the tip of the Light."Overlord Ragnock sighed before nodding. "Very well, we shall strengthen our wards about the vault. Even so, it will shatter them within a year.""I shall inform her of that fact immediately Overlord.""Thank you." Ragnok said and then turned to Harry. "Lord Potter, you are one of our largest account holders. Many of your ancestors have been named Friends of this Nation. We look forward to further interaction." He said and then left the office.They quickly made their way out of the back hallway and into the lobby where Griphook gave them the requested funds. Marlene shrank the ledgers Hermione was carrying in her arms and she then slipped them into her pocket.

Chapter 8When they exited the bank there were dozens of witches and wizards waiting at the foot of the steps. Marlene swirled her left hand in a circle causing a dark wood staff to appear, a ruby the size of an egg atop it. Her aura intensified dramatically. She strode to the top step near the crowd, while the teens waited a few feet behind her.Harry was finally recognized, someone yelled out, "It's the Potter boy!"Marlene's staff crashed into the marble step, the sound reverberated loudly and the crowd grew silent. "Lord Potter will be addressed as such. He has just taken up his ring. Any further insults will not be tolerated." Her magically altered voice crackled over them."So Madam Bones is supporting Lord Potter?" a tall frail wizard asked."I do not speak for Regent Bones, but I believe she has stated she is against the slander of Lord Potter printed in the Prophet." Marlene said."Lord Potter, will you answer some questions?" a witch asked."Ask and I will decide." Harry said after a moment's thought."Can you tell us what happened at the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament in your own words. We only have Albus Dumbledore's statement.""Yes." Harry said, his right hand finding Hermione's and pulling her with him to stand at the edge of the steps. "First, Cedric Diggory and myself reached the trophy together. We took it after agreeing to share. But it was a portkey which transported us to a graveyard. Someone said 'Kill the Spare' and a killing curse struck Cedric. I was subsequently knocked out. When I woke I was tied to a tombstone and a wizard was performing a ritual. I shall not go into details on this, but when it was complete the Dark Lord, who you all cannot name, was standing there. He and I traded spells, I was able to retrieve the trophy and it transported Cedric's body and myself back to Hogwarts."He was crying when he finished. Hermione had wrapped both arms around his waist, pressing her head against his shoulder. Daphne stepped to his side, placing her hand on his other shoulder. Ginny stayed where she was, but had to wipe her eyes clear.The crowd was silent for a moment until someone spotted the girl's rings. Marlene had to bang her staff again to get silence in the ensuing clamor to ask about them."I am Lord Potter and Heir Black." Harry said. "Hermione Granger is my Consort for House Potter, and will be Lady Potter. Daphne Greengrass is my betrothed for House Black. And before anyone asks, Ginny Weasley is a ward of House Potter, I will not answer questions about them and the subject is closed.""That is all." Marlene said. "Lord Potter will now spread some of his gold around the shops as he wishes to make purchases. I believe the first stop will be for ice cream to lift their spirits."Reluctantly the crowd dispersed. Though they were all in a bad mood they took Marlene's advice and moved to Fortescue's shop.To maintain her image Marlene stood just outside the shop, staff in hand, becoming as much of a statue as humanly possible. Her magic still seemed to be a physical thing, surrounding her in a golden aura that shimmered and danced in the sunlight."Miss Greengrass," Ginny said once they were at a table waiting for their order to arrive. "Can you teach me how I should be acting? I don't want to do anything stupid.""I shall, for now merely do as you're told, do not speak loudly. Much of this shopping is for you, tell us if you do not like something, otherwise accept what we choose.""Yes, thank you." Ginny said. "Did I do ok on the steps?""You did. Your position did not imply you were intimate with your Lord as ours did. It was a good start." Daphne said.Ginny blushed and twisted her hands in her robe under the table. More because of the word the blonde had chosen to use. Intimate was something the ginger was trying desperately not to think about. Especially in association with Harry."Why is all of this so hard?" Harry asked."Because old men like to think of ways to make others embarrass themselves." Hermione said as Mr. Fortescue arrived with their orders floating in front of him.Marlene started to attract a crowd of curious children, most well under the appropriate age for Hogwarts. Without her moving the ruby atop her staff emitted conjured things, first a large bouncing ball, and then a pair of puppies that scampered around in front of her, slowly exploring and sniffing the little children who dared come close."What was that about the McKinnon vault?" Harry asked."Not here." Daphne said."Thank you." A young mother said, while she watched the most adventurous of the children, a five year old boy, playing with a puppy and giggling."We are, and shall be, ready to defend you." Marlene said, the magic of her robe making it sound harsher than her usual gentle voice.The woman didn't look scared of the voice though and actually smiled before she knelt beside her son to whisper to him.A Hit Wizard exited the Leaky Cauldron. His hands, the only visible part of his body were a rich brown, his staff was topped by an emerald. There was a brief pause in his stride when he saw Marlene, but he merely lifted his staff in greeting and continued down the center of the Alley.Marlene's staff also rose briefly, but she set it back on the ground with nary a tap so the little boy was not startled by it."Merlin." Ginny breathed, "Two of them at once.""Her openly being here is forcing her brethren to make themselves visible." Daphne whispered. "Alone might have triggered an attack, but two of them will deter the Death Eaters.""Are they really that good?" Harry asked softly."Wait until we practice." Was all Daphne would say on that and she went back to eating her ice cream float, as it slowly drifted around in front of her.}-{(AN – WARNING! Cringe worthy Weasley family secrets ahead. GOL)"Molly, you've got to control your son." Sirius said. "When your husband gets here I'll have to tell him that Ron's banned from my home.""Yes, I know Sirius." Molly said. "Obliviate!" She quickly cast, striking Lord Black square in the face with the overpowered spell."You talked to Arthur and berated Ron, now you'll go steal some fire whisky from the Diggorys, get drunk, and do not return home until dinner time."Sirius snapped out of the spell, nodded once to Molly and shook his finger at Ron. "You can't go around attacking people young man.""Yes, Sir." Ron said morosely."Good." Sirius said and strode out the back door of the Burrow's kitchen, on his way to the Diggorys.Molly sat on the stool by the cooker, watching the man walk across the field. She was tempted to call the Aurors, but Dumbledore was too powerful to obliviate."Now we just have to obliviate dad again." Ron said."No, I never called him." Molly said. "I don't believe what you tried to do.""You promised me I could have her!" he said, still quite angry about the whole thing.Molly Weasley shook her head. "You've got to go about this slowly. We hadn't even started her on the love potion I've been making for you.""So I can pick another whore?" Ron said, rubbing his hands together in sudden glee. "I'll start with the Brown girl in Gryffindor, she's got big baps!"Molly shrugged, "You can't get caught! You've seen how I handle your father and brothers. Stun and obliviate them if they start getting curious. It makes them a bit strange but who cares. Now you need to go find that Lovegood girl and practice obliviating her again, you're terrible at it.""Can I grope her?"Molly shrugged again, "Only if you can obliviate it from her mind. Maybe that will give you some incentive.""Yeah." Ron said and hurried out the door and ran after Black, in the opposite direction of the Lovegood property.Molly sighed. Maybe she had obliviated him a bit too hard when she'd caught him trying to sneak into his sister's room in the middle of the night. "Oh well." She said and started brewing a new batch of stamina potions for Percy, he was due home soon and she was getting randy for her Perfect Percy. Perhaps he'd bring that delicious girlfriend of his, she so loved a threesome.(AN – I apologize if this section made you shiver. It makes me kind of ill writing it.

AN – First of all, thank you for the reviews, authors live off of them. Well they're more like cotton candy than anything I guess. OK, so I grinned at every EWWW or Yuck about my portrayal of the Weasley's in the previous chapter.I'm not one to explain much, but, oh who am I kidding…"Lord Black, why were you so easily overcome by the obliviation?""Really? I mean I did just spend twelve years in prison with these crazy things trying to suck my soul out of me. And I've never been known for my quick mind, c'mon I abandoned my godson to chase after his parent's betrayer?""But why didn't your ring protect you?""What?""I believe they think house rings can do something." Hermione clarified."Oh." Lord Black said. "Why?""They are portrayed as such in many fanfictions.""Oh." He said again."House rings serve as identification, nothing more. Which is why they can be used to 'sign' purchases at magical shops. They do not speak or shield their bearer." Daphne clarified."So when Ron attacked you it wasn't your ring?""No, the ring identified me to the Ancestral House of Black as someone to be protected, it was the magic of the house wards that protected me from Ron, and then the twins.""SHHHH""What?""That hasn't happened yet.""I haven't gone cavewoman on them?""No, not yet.""Oh, sorry, ignore that bit.""Why isn't Obliviation used more in the world?""Because the punishment for being caught is Azkaban?""Molly didn't seem to concerned about that?""She also isn't concerned about the fact that she gave Arthur a love potion to get him 'interested' in her, and likely still does. Nor does she care about telling both Hermione and Ginny that is a viable option for them.""But how could she do that to someone as powerful as Sirius?""Have you read book seven? This is the woman who out-dueled Bellatrix LeStrange. She isn't in the Order of the Phoenix just to cook and complain that everyone is too young.""Oh, yeah I remember that now.""Just one more question. Lady McKinnon, why aren't you wearing your Head of House ring?""Because I'm not the Head of House McKinnon." The statuesque blonde said. "I am A Lady of House McKinnon, but as most Ancient and Noble Houses, it is Patriarchal. My father was the last to hold the title.""So your husband would become Lord McKinnon?""No." She said with a glance at Harry who looked down. "My first born male child would become Lord McKinnon when he reaches his seventeenth birthday. In the meanwhile I would be Regent for House McKinnon. So my husband, or consort, would be able to retain his own name as it has no bearing on my family.""Thank you all for your time and assistance in clarifying some of these more salient points that have come up."END Authors Note, GolChapter 9The stop at the ice cream parlor had done its job. With renewed spirits the group headed into the shops. They made quick stops in the usual school supply stores to purchase higher quality products for Ginny and some for Harry. When it came to clothes they ignored Madam Malkin's, instead Marlene led them into an alley to the east of Gringotts which housed the very highest end clothiers in Britain.Once Lord Potter was recognized, they became the focus of the manager and sales clerks. Harry gave his Consort and Betrothed carte blanche and went to look through the displays.He did manage to locate several things that he thought Marlene would like, since she was outside of the shop it was easy to discuss them with the girls. They all agreed on a pair of high heeled dragon hide boots, then he found a dress that he knew she would look perfect in. His girls seemed a bit hesitant on it, but neither of them actually told him not to purchase it so it went into Daphne's pile.She in turn has to discuss it with the fitters but merely said it was for her Aunt Marlene. Since they had her measurements on file, the dress was altered appropriately and went into a bag.Ginny was in continual shock at the quality of the clothes, not even Pansy Parkinson could look down on her. The school robes from this shop were not just magically altered to fit, they had charms to keep the wearer warm or cool, and had plenty of expanded pockets to allow them to carry most of their books with them if they wished. She was quickly shown into a changing room and given a mountain of different styles and colors to try on.Harry walked outside and stood beside the Hit Witch. She again had a crowd and there were now four puppies yipping and playing with the children and one another. The adults shied away from him when he was recognized, though their children ignored him to continue playing. Their parents had told them that the witch in the ash grey robe would protect them from anything, so what was there to fear from a young wizard standing beside her?"Are we done?" Marlene asked him."Nearly, Daph and Mine are finishing up with Ginny's new wardrobe.""So only a few hours?"He thought he detected some stress in her voice, altered as it was, and took her right hand to give it a brief squeeze. She was a bit colder than she should be and he frowned. "We'll wrap up in the next ten minutes."She nodded and he headed back inside.Harry never saw the actual bill, since Hermione had no limit to her spending she had pressed her ring to it and the manager had grinned when it shimmered blue. "Thank you Consort Potter and Heir-Betrothed Black for your patronage. We look forward to supplying your future needs."When their purchases were packed in shrunken boxes they finally left the clothier and headed for the apparition point near the Leaky Cauldron.They saw the black Hit Wizard in the distance, he was talking a group of red-robed Aurors while another Hit Wizard was even farther away on the steps of Gringotts. If these men and women were really as good as Daphne implied, they would greatly boost the citizen's confidence, and tick off Riddle.Marlene's staff vanished and she took their hands to side along apparate them away. They collapsed in a heap on the front step of Grimmauld Place."What happened?" Harry asked, scrambling to get his glasses back in place."She's exhausted." Daphne said, her hand vanishing into the hood to feel her aunt's cheek. "We've got to get this robe off of her.""I'll carry her, open that door." Harry said and after a moment to get into position he picked the Hit Witch up in his arms. Silently thanking his summer exercise routine for giving him the ability to carry this beautiful woman, he followed Daphne into the house and up the stairs. Hermione stayed with Ginny to collect the spilled miniature boxes containing their purchases.Daphne opened Marlene's room and then helped Harry remove the grey robe. Marlene was pale, but her eyes were open and she had a lazy smile on her lips. "Next time you carry me across a threshold, I expect a ring." She said and laughed softly at his shocked expression."Aunt M." Daphne said. "You pushed too much magic into the robe. Do you want a pepper up or are you going to sleep it off?""I did?" Marlene said. "That was stupid of me.""But impressive." Harry said. "You made a very good impression on a lot of witches and wizards today. I also saw a second Hit Wizard on the steps of Gringotts just before we left so at least two of your brethren came to the Alley as well today."The beautiful woman smiled and his heart skipped a beat. "Bout time they got off there asses. Pepper up, dear. I need to eat before heading off to bed." Marlene said after a minute. "Oh, never mind I'm in my bed."Daphne hung the robe in her aunt's wardrobe and then opened a small trunk beside it. She shifted through several drawers before pulling out the potion.Harry helped hold Marlene up so she could drink the vile concoction. Once steam was pouring from her ears she was able to sit on her own so the teens retreated. Daphne to put the vial in a different drawer and then close the trunk and Harry to sit at the foot of the bed."I need to be more careful." Marlene said before either of them could. "Thank you for getting me out of that robe. It doesn't have its own magic and has to use mine to power it. I haven't spent that long in it in years. Though I guess I should practice more, and take breaks to eat every few hours.""Yes." Harry said. "You're no use to us if you pass out in a fight."Marlene laughed, a short un-humorous thing. "Yes, agreed. Tomorrow we will start on your introduction to real combat. After I've recovered, I hear there is a dueling chamber in the basement.""Let's see about dinner." Daphne said and pulled Harry from the room.After the purchases were sorted out the group gathered in the kitchen of the Black ancestral home for a late meal. Except there seemed to be no one in the house to prepare it.Mrs. Weasley had not returned, so Harry called for Dobby, instead a different house elf appeared. "Butt sniffing young master called?""Um." Harry said."Butt sniffing young master can't even speak." The decrepit thing said with a crooked smile."What?" Harry said."Kreature!" Sirius barked from the doorway, he had to lean on the frame as he was clearly drunk again. They were unsure just where he'd been hiding as they hadn't heard or seen anyone since their return half an hour ago, not even the twins had disturbed the silence of the house."Cock sucking old master is mad and drunk, oh glorious day." The being said and danced a quick step before vanishing in a loud crack."What the hell was that?" Harry said in shock."A very insane house elf." Marlene said sadly. "Or were you referring to the man who can't stay sober even with a locked alcohol cabinet in the house?""Who you think is drunk? And I'm not insane!" Sirius said. "Or is it the other way around? I'll ask mum. Mum, am I the cock sucker or butt sniffer again?" He walked back into the Parlor and closed the kitchen door. His mother started yelling obscenities though Sirius seemed to not care at the moment.Harry and Hermione looked after him in confusion. "Guess, I'll make dinner then." He said, heading to the magical cooker."Not without help." Hermione said and went to the nearest cabinet to start building an inventory in her mind.}-{Nearly an hour later, the house had again grown silent, the twins had set the table and complimented Ginny on her new clothes. Marlene had grown silent, she was the first to be served and dug into the massive platter that Harry sat before her. She'd skipped lunch like they all had, but she hadn't even had the ice cream and had been pushing her magic the whole nine hours they'd been out of the house.Sirius kept glancing between the exhausted woman and his godson, but even drunk he appeared to decide to hold his tongue.Shortly after they were all digging in, the front doorbell rang."Merlin!" Sirius yelled and stumbled from the table into the parlor, just as a string of obscenities started."Who dares befoul the Most Ancient and Noble house of Black? You cock sucking failure. I disowned you! Get your corruption—"The words were abruptly cut off as Sirius did something. "And once again we are blessed by the dulcet tones of Lord Black's caring mother." Marlene commented as the front door banged open."Perhaps I should speak with her?" Daphne said and continued when everyone looked at her in shock. "I am pureblood, from precisely the families and the reputations, that she professes to support. I'm hoping she will calm down when she realizes my children could be the future of the family."They didn't get a chance to think about that as Sirius started yelling. "Nymphadora, I've told you to just come inside. Why do you have to wake my mother?" The portrait once again woke."Foul creatures will not be tolerated in this noble—" The cursing was cut off by a sudden bang.In the absolute silence that followed they heard people walking to the kitchen door. Harry stood, drawing his wand, which prompted everyone else to do the same.Nym opened the door first and froze at the sight. Remus, his head turned to look over his shoulder, walked into her, she wavered on the brink of falling and then Sirius ran into them both. He had been walking backwards, his wand still pointed at his mother's portrait.The twins started laughing before the train wreck had even hit the floor.Marlene snatched the girl out from under the impending impact of the two grown men with a quick spell. In an instant Sirius fell on top of Remus, their legs tangling and their breath being knocked from them. Nym was lying on the floor having flown far enough to see the men crash together.Using her magic brought Marlene to one knee and Harry immediately moved to help her back into her seat."Wow." Nym said, leaning on her elbow as though she did this sort of thing all the time. "Come here often?" she said with a giggle, batting her lashes at her savior, and then got to her feet to help untangle the Marauders."So, we have dinner ready." Harry said, while Daphne took over helping her aunt back into her chair to finish her food. "Though we made breakfast since we couldn't find a lot of the ingredients.""When is our mum coming back?" Fred asked."Yeah, we really miss her cooking." George added."Cook breakfast for yourselves then." Ginny said back to them very quickly."Don't miss her enough to try and mimic her." One of them said."Now you see here Fred, I mean George, oh, would you just stop it and clean up this mess!" One of them tried to mimic their mother's voice.Ginny pointed her wand at the second twin. "George, shut it." When the other twin opened his mouth her wand shifted to him and he snapped it shut. The twins went back to eating the eggs their sister had helped prepare."You know Harry. If you tire them out so fast, you should pursue younger witches like Nymmie here." Sirius said when they were all sitting at the table, the newly arrived adults working on the left overs.Ginny wasn't the only one to gasp."Bad Padfoot!" Hermione said and a quick jab with her wand caused a rolled up newspaper to appear and smack him over the head twice.Sirius seemed fairly dazed by the impact, but Hermione kept talking regardless. "Miss McKinnon is exhausted from guarding us all day with her Hit Witch robe active and skipping lunch. I dare say such a thing would have killed you!""But." The stunned Marauder said, holding his head."Uncle." Nymphadora said sharply to gain his attention. "You do not have permission to meddle in my love life. I already have a mother.""Um…" He said "Sorry, I think I better head to bed. Moony, search the house, I don't remember just where I found that bottle of Fire Whiskey."Once his footsteps had faded above them Remus spoke up. "Harry, I spent several hours at the Ministry with Dumbledore. Apparently the underage magic charge is not going to be dismissed. I'm sorry I couldn't bring you better news.""Tough break Harrykins." One of the twins said."Is there a trial?" Hermione asked, both of her hands gripping one of Harry's."Not that we could determine, but it's likely." Remus said.Marlene stood first, put her hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezed gently. "I'm heading up to bed, we'll discuss this tomorrow.""I'll come help you." Daphne said, quickly getting to her feet.Marlene gave another soft squeeze of his shoulder, nodded to her niece and headed upstairs."Guess we better get to bed too." One of the twins said, a bit eagerly and they headed out the door."Sorry about him." Nym said. "Mum thinks he's not really in this decade. He called you James a few times when she was talking to him. She helped him stop that, but he's not right in the head.""At least he isn't calling me Lily." Ginny said softly looking at her plate."As though my parents were never killed?"Nymphadora shrugged, "Mum's the healer.""Can you ask her to find a mind healer for him?" Hermione asked.A scream, from upstairs, rent the silence of the house and the Black Ancestral Manor shook as it had the previous night.

Chapter 10Harry's magic pulled him from his chair and he was again running upstairs before he realized it.He met Sirius stumbling downward from his rooms on the top floor on the landing of the fourth. There they found the Weasley twins, naked, tarred and feathered. Their heads appeared to have been transfigured into blocks of wood without eyes. The whole area stank of hot tar. Except for the fact they were screaming in terror they were immobilized by a beam of magic coming from the Black crest over the Heir suite.Daphne was standing by her aunt's door, completely nude except for her Hit Witch Apprentice stole, which was nearly sufficient to cover her top, but left most of her bare. Her eyes were actually glowing green as she cast yet another curse at the twins, a beaters bat appeared in front of each of them and slammed up into their groins, lifting them from the ground and causing them to howl in renewed pain.Harry stood there in shock for a second before scooping up his Betrothed and carrying her into their suite. Her bare flesh, and the massive amount of magic she was throwing around, made his entire body tingle, but he managed to get her to the closet and pull a robe around her."Stay here." He told her, making sure she was actually looking at him. When the green tint faded from her eyes and she only gave him a watery look, he couldn't leave her and instead hugged her tightly.Then Hermione was there, joining their hug and pushing Harry out of the way. "Get them out of this house, or we're leaving." She told him.With something productive to do, Harry gave both of them a quick kiss on the cheek and ran back to the landing.He found the adults all standing around arguing about the twins. Ginny was huddled behind the still exhausted Hit Witch. The magic from the Black Crest had stopped, leaving the boys moaning on the ground."I want all Weasley's banned from this house!" He said, breaking into the argument as to what to do."Harry!" Marlene said sharply, her arm tightening on the suddenly terrified ginger beside her as the Black Crest glowed again."My Ward is permitted," he amended himself quickly. "In the last two days, each of my ladies has been assaulted in this house by a Weasley. Consort Potter has declared that we will seek safer accommodations if this is not done. We'd be safer at Malfoy Manor!""I, can't do that Harry." Sirius said slowly, the Black Crest going dark. "Four of them are in the Order and this is where they meet." He explained quickly, raising his hands."Lord Potter," Marlene said, calling their attention to her.Ginny had gone into Marlene's room and pushed one of the chairs out for the exhausted woman to sit in. The scraping of it across the wooden floor caused everyone to pause and watch her. When she stepped out of the bedroom, the doorway flashed white and her clothes vanished.Like them all, she stood there for a second in shock, then picked up her wand where it was clattering on the floor and yelled. "Those were the first new clothes I ever owned!" Her wand flashed and her famous bat-bogie hex hit first one twin and then the other.Since their heads were wood, great gobs of sap stretched from their noses and then shifted into bat shaped sap, which then began to peck at their heads.Marlene grabbed Ginny, spun her away from everyone else, and hugged her into her room, closing the door with a flick of her foot.The slamming door managed to break the rest of them from their shock.Nymphadora drew her wand and inspected the doorway, she cast a few spells and then poked two places along each side causing another flash of the entire doorway. Two piles of clothes materialized and fell to the floor.She stepped back, looking down at her own clothes, which were still in place. "Dispelled it." She said in satisfaction before turning back to the twins. "You're really a nasty bit of work for a pair of sixteen year olds. I bet you'll be in Azkaban shortly after your seventeenth birthday at this rate."Marlene's door opened. Ginny was dressed in a too-long yellow bathrobe and blushing brightly as she hugged the garment to herself tightly."I've dispelled it." Nymphadora told them, and then stepped into the doorway and back out, when nothing happened, Marlene nodded.Ginny helped Marlene walk out and sit in the chair she'd pushed out earlier. The Hit Witch held her hand. "Auror Tonks, have you received your obliviation license?""Yes Ma'am?" Nymphadora said crisply.Harry noticed a look of surprise on Ginny's face at that."Obliviate all males in this house, except Lord Potter, of the details of his Betrothed's and his Ward's nude bodies. They are to remember the incident and their parts in it. Make sure your Auror signature is in that spell, I don't want some mind healer unlocking it, thinking they had been assaulted. You may reverse the transfiguration on the twins to accomplish this.""Yes, Ma'am." Nymphadora said and turned first to her cousin."Well Harry, she's gorgeous, at least I'll remember that fact. I consent to this." He said the last firmly, looking at the house crest and then met his cousin's eyes."Obliviate!" The Auror cast and delicately altered his memory."Nym, please remove my memory of Ginny's body. Unless, and until our relationship evolves it's not right for me to have this in my head." Harry said as she moved to deal with the twins. He glanced at Ginny who gave him a friendly smile in thanks."Of course Lord Potter." She said and paused in front of him. "Obliviate!" she cast and the pinched expression on his face relaxed."Thanks." He said, blinking, it was definably a weird sensation to have a memory suddenly gone.She then turned her attention to Remus who didn't flinch as she repeated the spell on him.Finally she stunned the twins, canceled the transfiguration on them, returning their heads to normal and dispelling the sap-bats. Unfortunately she found herself unable to cancel the tar or feathers.Remus knelt beside one of them and propped his head up, and then held his eyes open for her to obliviate him. They then moved on to the other twin and repeated the process."Now, Auror." Marlene said calling everyone's attention to herself again. "You are to return them to their parent's home. With their belongings, and inform their parents that the next time they are caught in a criminal act they will be prosecuted.""Very well Ma'am." Nymphadora said."I'll give her a hand." Remus said, levitating the boys down the stairs before anyone could challenge his offer."I don't know what to say Harry." Sirius said, looking tired. "I had such hopes for you staying with me.""I'll ask my ladies what they want to do." Harry said turning back to Sirius."We can move to Castle McKinnon. If that pleases you and your ladies?" Marlene said."Thank you." Harry said, picked up Daphne's clothes, including her daggers and spare wands, before heading into his suite.}-{Crookshanks and the black kitten he still didn't know the name of, were sitting a few feet inside the room, watching the door as though they were guard dogs. Hedwig had somehow entered the suite and was asleep on the perch near the window.The girls were snuggled in his bed, they had changed into thick nightgowns. Hermione was cradling her lover to her breast and slowly running her fingers through her hair, while she cried softly.He placed the pile of clothes on Daphne's bed and then changed himself, choosing to wear a pair of sweat pants and t-shirt before standing at the end of the bed to catch Hermione's attention.When she looked up at him he pointed at either side of them and then shrugged.She pointed behind herself and he slid into bed where she indicated. He placed a hand on Daphne's shoulder, gave it a gentle squeeze while he pushed some of his magic into her."Thank you, Harry." Daphne said clearly, but kept her eyes closed. "I'm sorry they managed to do that to me.""Nothing to worry about. Nym obliviated your appearance from Sirius and the twin's minds, then she and Remus took the twins back to the Burrow.""But I'm still in your head." Daphne said."Yes, but you're mine. And I do claim you as such." He said, causing his magic to surge a bit stronger, though still fairly controlled."Thank you." The blonde said and snuggled tighter into Hermione's arms, her tears finally abating.The brilliant brunette turned her head and kissed his cheek. "Good boy, too bad you'll have to wait for your reward. Tonight was supposed to be a lot more fun."Harry fell asleep to the image still in his mind of his Betrothed and how hot she looked when she was pissed.

Chapter 11Harry woke slowly, comfortably warm and surrounded by the magic of those he trusted."Morning love." Hermione said and cast the mouth cleaning charm on him, and then a spell that relieved his full bladder.Before he could even open his eyes in surprise Daphne wrapped him in a tight, but not stifling embrace and lay her head on his shoulder so she could slowly kiss his neck. Each kiss sent a very gentle burst of her magic into him.His witch's lover had slipped past his resistance and he gladly accepted this gift from her. She wore his ring and would one day be his wife, there was no reason to push her away, unless Hermione wished it, but she had instead made every effort to help them get to this point.Hermione helped him sit up and then removed his shirt, shushing him when he began to protest. Daphne hesitated before sliding her hands down his sides and delicately over his scarred back. The gentle kisses to his neck moved up to just under his ear and grew longer, slower, with a much greater flow of her magic. As her gentle touch lingered on one of his scars hot tears dripped onto his shoulder."Has anyone tried to heal these?" She whispered into his jaw."No," he managed to push out through his tight throat."We shall, and House Black demands vengeance." The intensity of her statement was accompanied by a wave of magic that went straight to his cock."Not yet Daph." Hermione said gently and directed him to lie on the bed, with Daphne's help, she laid him down and they cuddled tightly into his sides. This left them each with only one arm, as their other was folded to hold their heads up."Everything will be ok love." Hermione said, her hand easing into his pants to straighten out his folded member, not pushing him to remove his pants. Once it was no longer causing him pain she withdrew her hand and traced lazy patterns on his stomach.Though the blonde was well aware of her lover's actions she kept her attention on his face and her free hand in the short hairs of his chest. "I'll not leave your side." Daphne said. "It is my right to be with you throughout the trial." Her hand met Hermione's and their fingers intertwined before pressing lightly on his stomach.He was rather surprised at the sudden shift in topic, if anything he'd expected questions about the previous night. "Thank you." He said and then remembered something that seemed to happen days ago. "Before we went to Gringotts I was talking to Marlene. She was using a mirror to speak with Madam Bones, the head of magical law enforcement. She, Madam Bones that is, said that Marlene would tear apart the charges if Fudge forced a trial.""That's really good news." Hermione said."Well." Daphne said and hesitated to continue but did after a moment. "It means she will have to reveal her identity. It's one of the reasons their War Robes conceal them. Kind of like if you could remove your scar so no one recognized you. Once she's known the criminals might attack her because she's a Hit Witch.""Yeah, it would be great not to be known." Harry said and hugged both girls for a moment. "Will she lose her job over it?""No, but she might quit anyway." Daphne said, her hair tickling his arm as she did so, making him twitch. "She will need more freedom to go after Death Eaters than she has now.""Will what's in her vault help her?" Hermione asked.In a soft voice, just above a whisper, she answered. "My grandfather, Aunt M's father, was killed by Voldemort shortly before his downfall. The destruction they caused in that fight was immense. There used to be a second wizard village, like Hogsmeade, called Oakwallow, it no longer exists. Though grandpa was killed he did hurt the Dark Lord, no one reported seeing him for almost a month. Anyway grandpa willed everything to Aunt M. The McKinnons have long fought against the Dark. I have knights of the Round Table, among my ancestors. Like Potter, Bones and Longbottom, they have been among the families every Dark Lord or Lady tries to destroy first. As such our lines have suffered greatly.""And Marlene is the very last to bear that name?" Hermione asked with a strange tremble in her voice."She is." Daphne said. "As Harry is the last Potter.""Do you know what's in the vault?" Harry asked after they lay there quietly for a few minutes. Hermione was dragging Daphne's finger around on his chest.Daphne shrugged. "I'm not sure. It was said that grandpa's robes were actual battlemage ones from long ago, I don't know if it survived the battle that took his life. Whatever it is, it seemed to be sentient the way the Overlord spoke of it. Aunt M. was only sixteen at the time and decided to seal it in the family vault until later. I don't know why."As they lay there cuddling he drifted off, waking later when Daphne levered herself up to sit beside him and pulled her nightgown off over her head. She blushed a bit as Harry's attention immediately focused on her, Hermione helped lift his head by moving her arm under it and putting his glasses so he could see quite clearly."We don't want to push you too far love." Hermione said as Daphne sat topless on their bed. "But we will move forward."Her blush reached nearly to the top of her gorgeous breasts and he was instantly fascinated by them. They were very similar to Hermione's as such things are meant to be, but slightly different in shape and color. Daphne's breasts were higher on her chest, and a bit smaller while her nipples were a healthy pink."I figured you have a memory of the bottom half, you ought to see the top as well."In spite of the distractions in front of him he felt anger and that brought a scowl to his face. "That's not right, you should put your shirt back on." He said.She looked as though he'd slapped her and Hermione hissed, "Harry!"Daphne turned to climb from the bed, but Hermione caught her in a tight hug, "He didn't mean it like that." She said into her ear, looking angrily at him."He said it Mine. I heard him. He doesn't want me. I knew there wouldn't be room for me. Like Aunt M. I'll just fight until I die." The Ice Queen said into her lover's shoulder, each like a blow to him. Her sobs were nearly silent and so reminiscent of his own from the cupboard under the stairs that he flashed back to when he was six and had been thrown in there by his uncle."I'm sorry." He said automatically, his chest felt like a Horntail had stepped on him. How could it have gone from hugging and kissing to this?"Explain yourself to her Harry. If I do it she'll think you're just going along with what I say to make her happy. But if this is the way you want it then so be it." Hermione's voice was not the usual warm and caring tone, this was far colder and he could tell he'd hurt her as well. She was truly in love with Daphne, she never lied to him so that was a fact he had to adjust to.He suddenly felt like his entire future rested on this moment. Yet there was a part of him that felt this was what would always happen, he was meant to be alone, to die alone. It was hard to breathe and he felt dizzy, his world revolved around Hermione. But maybe that was where the problem was, he hadn't really believed that she was really in love with someone else, it was just something to get him to go along with a three way relationship. What if it was the other way around? What if they needed one another as much as he needed Hermione? Oh Merlin…He looked into Hermione's chocolate brown eyes, eyes that told him so much, now all he saw was her pain, pain he'd caused."I'm sorry Daphne." He said a bit firmer than he thought, but kept his eyes locked with Hermione's. "I was angry about what happened to you last night. I felt you were acting just because of the cruel thing the twins did to you and Ginny. I didn't want you to feel obligated. I felt this was too soon and you were not ready. But I am not your master, nor am I Hermione's. What she has given me is far more precious to me than my own life. It's hard for me to imagine you want to do the same."While he was talking Daphne had turned her head to face him, she was still tucked tightly in Hermione's embrace and it didn't look like the brunette would ever release her. He realized then that even if he did not accept Daphne into his life she was a permanent part of Hermione's."I'm not happy with anyone trying to control my life." She whispered bitterly. "That was what my father always tried to do. But I love Mine, and will do anything to be with her for the rest of my life.""And I her." Hermione said."I was ready that first night." Daphne whispered with a sigh, she took a trembling breath and then grew calm in an instant. "I have no reservations about giving myself to you. She trusts you, therefore I do. I do not want to be like my Aunt, she's never found someone she can trust and love.""I want us to be together." Hermione said and turned the girl in her arms back to Harry. "Are we good?" She asked him.That pain in his chest was back, she should never have to ask him that. "Yes, of course." His arms came up and the girls fell atop him, pushing him back on the bed, all of them crying in relief.It was several minutes later when they calmed down. Daphne was pressed tightly against his chest, her breasts squashed up against him. "I'm going to kiss you, and Mine is going to fuck you, after that I want you to fuck me, is that alright?" She asked, her face hovering over his. When he nodded she slowly brought her freshly painted lips down to mate with his.He hardly dared move, except to keep his lips with hers. Both of their mouths were slightly open as they gradually learned one another. Harry's arms came up, but he hesitated to wrap them around her slim torso."I want this." She said into his mouth. "Touch me." And her lips became more insistent, tongue snaking between his lips to brush against his.Daphne moved herself further up his torso until her breasts were beside his head and they could no longer kiss. Then Hermione tugged his sweatpants and boxers off, freeing him at last. It didn't take long for her to strip and straddle his hips to take him into herself.His new lover shifted to the side, brushing her breast and nipples across his cheeks and over his mouth. He latched on, on her second pass. She stilled, placed one of her arms along the bed to support herself while her free hand removed his glasses and then caressed his cheek.He'd hardly dared imagine what being with two girls would be like. What he had thought, was not nearly as good as this. And he'd nearly destroyed it by not thinking. Hermione loved having his mouth on her, especially when he used Parseltongue. Unfortunately he still had to close his eyes for this, though she had threatened to get a snake tattooed on her bare pubic mound.His magic surged into his Slytherin lady, making her cry out briefly in surprise at the sudden sensation. She welcomed it, pressing herself down onto him a bit harder, but aware he needed to breathe around her smothering flesh.Daphne was startled when he hissed, her nipple was drawn taught in his mouth, the most intense pleasure she'd ever imagined went through her body. She couldn't breathe for a moment and it was fortunate that he was holding her firmly or she would have shifted violently at the sensation."Good girl Daph." Hermione said from behind her. She pulled the blonde's red silk panties to the side and slid her long fingers along the wet slit, pausing as she reached the nub to pinch it. "Now give him your other teat." She punctuated the order by working three of her fingers into Daphne's dripping cunt.Daphne shifted her torso to bring her other breast to his mouth.Hermione started working Harry to his culmination, leaning back to reach her other hand down to tickle his balls with her nails, while hooking her fingers to anchor her to the blonde. His magic was causing their hair, to float as though affected by static electricity.She shivered in her own pleasure and flicked her head to get her hair out of her eyes, then focused her attention on moving faster, squeezing him on each stroke. The fingers of her right hand, buried in Daphne, were fucking the blonde fairly hard as she bounced on him. She twisted her arm a bit farther and was able to get her thumb over her lover's clit and pressed on it.Harry just managed to repeat his Parseltongue performance on Daphne's other nipple and he erupted up into his Consort.The three of them lay there, each recovering from their own peak. Hermione was first, slipping her fingers free of the sopping hole and licking them clean before sliding down on the bed and using her wand to clean them off.Daphne rolled onto her back, her panties pulled tight along the side of her cunt, leaving the dripping slit bare. It would take the blonde a while to recover from her first encounter with Harry's talented tongue.The fabled Ice Queen was a hot, sweaty, dazed pile of goo. It was one of the hottest things he'd ever imagined in his life, and with Hermione Granger as his lover, that was fairly amazing even to him.The sight of her got him hard again, causing Hermione to giggle at his own dazed expression. "Go on, make my lover yours. She's all ready, maybe a bit too ready, but don't worry about hurting her. I claimed that last year.""How?" He said, rather confused and his cock began to deflate as he was distracted."No." Hermione said, wrapping her fingers around his shaft making it spring back to life. "Later." She said firmly and kissed him roughly.That had initially been a surprise, she liked it a bit rough in bed. And Merlin the things she came up with to try!"Hareee." Daphne whined, grabbing his arm. "My turn Mine…""Are you sure Daph?" Harry asked her.She gave him a lazy grin and struggled to remove her mangled panties. When she was completely nude she spread herself open him and dipped a long, red tipped finger inside herself. It then went deep into her mouth and she sucked it clean. "Yep, I'm ready and delicious."He was over her a moment later and she wrapped her arms around his neck. His cock slid around as she initially tried to help. When she kept her hips still he slid into her, causing them both to freeze a moment at the perfection of it all. And then he started moving while she tried to learn how to move her hips."Oh, Daph." Hermione said, knee-walking around them on the bed. "Remember all those presents I gave you last year? I've got another one ready for you.""I'm hungry, give it here.""What?" Harry said, slowing in his fucking of this wonderful new cunt."Almost every time, after you and I had sex, I'd meet Daph and have her clean me out." Hermione said in her soft husky voice."Oh, I felt him grow." Daphne said with a grin. She pulled him down for another kiss and then pushed his chest up until he was sitting between her splayed legs."Put her legs on your shoulders Harry." Hermione said and squatted over Daphne's face.The blonde eagerly reached her tongue up and went to work, wrapping her arms around Hermione's thighs.Hermione grinned and moved Harry's hands to grope her. "Isn't she just the perfect witch? You know I claimed her back in third year, fuck her perfect cunt. Make her yours." She moaned into his ear, making him wild.When he was getting close she snaked her hand between them to pinch one of Daphne's hard nipples. "She's got another talent you're just going to love."He could only manage a grunt, lost as he was."Do it!" She said, pulling up on the nipple until it slipped from her grip.The subsequent sibilant speech that came from below them sent Hermione to entirely new heights of pleasure. The magic she pushed into them brought both to their end as well.Harry froze for a few seconds, every muscle in his body seemed to be clenching at once, then he collapsed to the side, taking the girls with him. He lay there panting as Hermione struggled to move, even as she experienced after shocks."You're a Parselmouth?" He asked when he got his breath back.Daphne was busy wiping her face with the sheet, but nodded and answered him a moment later. "It's hereditary to the McKinnon line.""So, her aunt has it as well." Hermione said and then dug her tongue into Daphne's dripping cunt to scoop out Harry's seed as he lay there stunned at the sight.

Chapter 12Harry leaned on his elbow, fixing his glasses again. "That was perfect. Wow, that's a better view." He said, staring between Daphne's splayed legs as Hermione's tongue continued to scoop and swirl."She's delicious too." Hermione purred and then dove back into her work.His stomach grumbled. He leaned down and kissed Daphne slowly. "Thank you. I'll start the shower for us, join me.""Yes," She smiled lazily at him, her fingers twisting in Hermione's long hair.The clock on the mantle showed it was already eight and his stomach grumbled again. He was in the shower before even the magically heated water could reach the proper temperature.Just before he gave up and turned the water off, his ladies slipped into it with him. Daphne closest, he didn't have his glasses on of course so he couldn't see any details, but he could fill those in with what he'd seen on the bed.His godfather was right, she was gorgeous and Harry was a lucky bloke."Morning." He said officially kissing Daphne's lips before giving her a quick hug and turning so she was under the water and he was between them. When she moved her arms from him to get her suddenly wet hair out of her eyes, he released her to grab the soap and start working on her trim, athletic body."Hmmm." She groaned. "Mine, you didn't tell me he helped wash.""Never has." Hermione said, taking the bar from him and lathering up his back, since she knew he hadn't touched it with more than cascading water."Oh, I like that." He said, leaning forward to kiss Daphne who was getting her long blonde mane thoroughly wet."Like soaping up my wet boobies?" She said with a giggle."Well that too, I meant Mine scrubbing my back.""But I got the kiss!" She sang making them all laugh.Harry turned to Hermione and picked her up as he had Daphne, a moment later and he was now the farthest from the water. "I need contacts!" he said jokingly causing them both to laugh.With a broad grin on his face he slipped out of the shower to dry off. "Really I do." He said again, eliciting another laugh from them. "It would be much better than having to constantly find my glasses if I fall.""Harry." Hermione said, speaking up over the water. "We will not hide from you, you can look at us all you want. But yes, that sounds like a good idea.""There are magical ones, but they're very expensive." Daphne said as he finished drying off."Expensive for me or for most people?""Most people," his Slytherin said with a laugh."Perhaps we should all get a pair, to let us see in the dark." Hermione added."I'm getting dressed for breakfast." He said and left them in the shower. Life was good for Harry Potter, he thought to himself.}-{Remus, Ginny and Marlene were in the kitchen when they arrived. The tall woman had tea going and Ginny had found several varieties of marmalade. Everyone settled for a bowl of cereal or toast with marmalade. Remus was mostly done with the paper and passed it to them when they sat.The Daily Prophet barely mentioned him or his girls. They were page 2 material, while the two Hit Wizards and Witch in Diagon Alley was all over the front page. Apparently the one Harry had seen as they left was giving an interview. His message echoed Marlene's, they were there to keep everyone safe and bring the criminals to justice. He added that many times in the past if the citizens in question had fought back, instead of running, then a lot of the destruction would have been prevented."Luc always pushes a little too far." Marlene said and shook her head."Why is that a bad idea?" Harry asked."Because they are sheep." Daphne said quickly."Most of them." Marlene said. "They follow the crowd and don't care enough to think for themselves. It's why they rely on our four families to defend them against the darkest evils.""What about Dumbledore? Didn't he stop Grindlewald?" Hermione asked and received a brief glare from the Hit Witch."Dumbledore helped create that monster. It was his duty to destroy him. Though my father, along with Charlus Potter, were also heavily involved in that war. Grindlewald killed my older brother in the same battle that Dumbledore finally beat him in.""Oh." Hermione said and looked at her plate."I am not angry with you Hermione." Marlene said, "But it is an example where there were just not enough wands willing to do the right thing. Most of the wizard populous hid or moved out of the conflict."Nymphadora came into the room, surprisingly not disturbing the portrait in the entrance. "Oh, good I found you. Since my uncle is still sleeping I need to tell you this now." She said pouring herself a cup of scalding tea. "When I obliviated him last night it was far too easy. Either he's been hit with them repeatedly for the last few weeks, or he was really damaged by Azkaban.""Either way he needs a mind healer soon." Marlene said."My mum did a lot of work with him last month, she won't really tell me anything but I'll mention it to her. After Remus and I delivered the twins, we talked to Arthur. He was really shocked and then bound all but ten percent of their magic, just enough to keep them alive. He refused to clean them, instead shoving them out into the night and yelling about the pond.""Wow, I've never heard him actually berate his children." Harry said.Daphne noticed Ginny bite her lip and then withdraw into herself further.Remus shrugged. "It seemed like Molly wanted to help them, she had her wand out, but wasn't willing to do it in front of her husband or us."Since Daphne was observing Ginny she saw her flinch at that statement and resolved to sit the girl down later to discover what was going on.}-{The training room was a long chamber, runes were etched into slate tiles that covered every surface. It was about ten meters by twenty. Harry had expected weapons racks or targets, something other than an empty room."These runes prevent spells from destroying the walls or even the house above us." Marlene said.Harry had watched her carefully, but she showed no signs of problems from her fatigue the previous day."We'll start with a little target practice to warm up." Marlene said and waved her wand at the far end. Four archery targets appeared, suspended in midair, about chest height to an average man. "Piercing hexes please, each of us take three shots and we'll go compare them."The hex itself was very simple and effective. It was the magical equivalent to a bullet, though without the kinetic force. It essentially disintegrated a small amount of matter, whether it be stone, earth, or flesh.Marlene stilled herself and her wand came up. She deliberately said the words to the spell and quickly fired a trio at her target.Hermione fired one, then another and paused.Harry shrugged and fired three of them rapidly at the target."Is everyone done?" Marlene asked."Yes." Harry said while Hermione cast her final spell and Daphne said she was done, though he hadn't heard anything from her.They walked to the targets, Harry immediately realized he had completely missed with two of the spells, while the third had blown a hole in it near the center. Two of Hermione's spells were in the central ring, though neither went completely through the target. Her third shot seemed to have missed completely or had been so underpowered as to not be noticeable.Marlene had a fairly equally spaced triangle in the precise center, while Daphne had a larger hole in the middle of hers."So, Hermione needs to work on the strength of her spells, and Harry needs to focus on his aim. My spells are where I wanted them, and Daphne continues to impress me. Three spells placed so tightly together they form a single larger hole."Marlene waved her wand, two of the targets moved to the other end of the room and all four of them were repaired. "Hermione, I will work with you on your focus. Daphne, take Harry to the other end, four or five meters from the target and work on his aim.""Sure." Daphne said and hooked her arm with his to move him into the middle of the dueling chamber. "Something's up with Ginny." She said to him as they walked closely together."What?""Not sure, I caught her looking thoughtful, concerned and surprised when Nym and Remmy were discussing what happened at The Burrow last night."He was a bit surprised at her strange name for Remus, but decided it wasn't worth asking about. "You know I saw a weird look on her face while we were discussing what to do about her brothers.""Let me try and talk to her later, she did ask for some lessons. I'll let you know if she won't explain it to me.""Sure." He said moving his arm around her slim shoulders. "So how did you aim so well with your spells?" he asked his betrothed a minute later."Practice." She said with a cheeky grin and then turned to face him properly. "It doesn't really matter how much you overpower your spells, and you do that a lot, if they can't hit your target you're wasting your strength. Now better glasses might help you, and we'll get that taken care of soon, but for now, think about it this way. Just before you cast a spell, let out your breath, that will help you become still, then release your magic. Go on, cast a few while I watch."Well that didn't sound too difficult and they were much closer than the first attempt. Before he cast the Slytherin Ice Queen stood in front of him and repositioned him, first turning his shoulders to they pointed at the target and then fixing his hips and feet. "That's different.""Yeah," she said with a nod, "It gives your opponent the smallest target to aim at, and allows you the greatest range of motion. Give it a go."}-{"Hermione," Marlene said when they were alone. "I know you don't feel like you're any good in a fight, but your magic is stronger than mine.""So what's wrong?" Hermione asked, her intelligent eyes looking up into the tall woman's brilliant blue ones."What you lack is the will to do harm." The Hit Witch answered softly. "You do not want to hurt others. But, you must overcome this, or good people will die. These self-serving sanctimonious bastards want us under them for their pleasure, only after they tire of us will they kill us.""I know." Hermione said, her gaze dropping."It will not be a clean death, they will torture us, cut off pieces of us, until their healing spells just won't let us scream for them any longer. Once we're dead, they'll torture Harry and then kill him." She knew she was playing a dangerous game, but it was one she'd played with recruits in the past. She had to succeed here, or she feared they would all fall."I've read some of the reports, are they real?" Hermione asked, beginning to tremble.Marlene wrapped her arm around the brilliant girl's shoulders. "They are far worse than what is published. I do not expect to live, all of my line is gone. I shall make my ancestors proud and not die whimpering for mercy, which will surely not be granted.""But someone…""Is me!" Marlene said with all of her considerable authority. She turned the young witch to face her, placing her hands on her shoulders. "I am the last McKinnon, my family was sworn by the Crown to hunt evil more than a millennia ago. I am a Hit Witch, whose job is to catch those who support The Dark. I am the someone that everyone expects to stand up to these bastards, and I shall.""I just want to live with Harry and Daph.""Yes, you deserve to be happy, and have Harry's children, these men want to stop that. But Malfoy would love to have any of us under him, knowing he was taking what was once Harry's.""No!" Hermione said, her back straightening, magic flaring."I cannot do this alone, but none-the-less I will try until I no longer draw breath.""You will not be alone!" The mate of The-Boy-Who-Lived declared. Her wand came up and a furious storm of her will shot from it. The target she had earlier failed to pierce vanished as the mass crashed into it. The magic continued into the ruined tiles of the wall, which were designed to absorb excess magic. Initially it looked like it would work as the storm vanished into the wall, but then most of the wall turned red, the ones where the magic had impacted shifted to white and cracked."Shield!" Daphne barked, casting her own spell from the other end of the chamber, between the wall, her lover and aunt.Marlene summoned her dark-wood staff and knelt, her other hand shoving Hermione behind her. The ruby flared and a massive shield surrounded them as the tiles gave way, sending shards ricocheting around the room.Harry dragged Daphne to the ground, shielding her with his body, and threw up a hasty shield of his own over them.The chamber shook violently and the lights went out.When the shaking stopped Harry, who was crushing the Ice Queen to his chest released her. "Are you ok?" he asked as she gasped for breath in his ear."Yes," she managed to say.Harry scrambled to his feet and moved towards a red glow in the haze.Daphne placed a bubble head charm over the two of them and then conjured several globes of light that floated around the chamber, revealing their surroundings.Marlene's shield had held, though it had been forced to compress so the two it protected were intertwined.When the Hit Witch saw Harry standing there, she dismissed the shield and then her staff as Harry hugged them both.A bubble-head charm appeared over their heads as more light arrived at the top of the stairs. "What happened?" Sirius yelled and then started coughing as he inhaled the dust.Marlene cast something and the dust collected into small balls that fell to the ground."I'm ok." Hermione said, standing on shaky feet and looking around in confusion. "What did I do?""You overloaded the protections." Marlene said and gave the surprised brunette a gentle hug. "Told you, you were strong enough." She said and brushed her fingertips across the girl's cheek."Harry!" Daphne yelled and grabbed his shirt to rip it from him, spinning him so she could see his back by one of her light globes. There was a gash along his right side, just under his shoulder blade. "You're hurt, stay still.""Really?" he asked trying to look over his shoulder but she squeezed his shoulder harder and he froze."Accio shards." Daphne cast, dozens of tiny pieces of tile were pulled from the cut in his back. Blood started flowing freely from several places along the cut."Ouch, damn that hurt." He said and fell to one knee."Just a minute." Daphne said from behind him. "Vulnera Sanentur," she sang, drawing her wand down the wound, which immediately stopped bleeding and sucked the loose blood back into his body. She repeated the song-like incantation and again traced the wound with her wand causing the muscle and flesh to knit back together, she did it a third time and the scar virtually vanished. "There," she said and wrapped her arms around him from behind, kissing his cheek and crying.Harry pulled her in front of him and kissed her properly as Hermione joined them on the floor."What in Merlin's name happened?" Sirius said after he stopped coughing."Our resident bookworm decided she's willing to actually use her magic." Marlene said softly, sitting on one of the steps and grinning at the trio."I thought the house was going to fall."She shrugged, "At this rate it will. Your dueling room needed updating anyway. Slate is the worst material to absorb magic, now you can get it redone with sandstone much cheaper as the demolition work is done."He laughed and headed upstairs, pushing Nymphadora ahead of him.

Chapter 13"Mr. Potter?" The Headmaster called from the top of the stairs. "Is everyone alright down there?""Yes. We're fine." Harry called while Hermione repaired his shirt and helped him get it tucked in quickly.Daphne dispelled their bubble head charms and removed the dust from their clothes."We're coming up." Marlene said and led the group back into the kitchen. "We discovered that the magic absorbing tiles have deteriorated, since their original installation." She explained to the Headmaster when she reached the kitchen.."You shouldn't be allowing them to use magic." He told her, not quite trying to give her an order."Headmaster." Harry said. "What's going on?"Dumbledore ignored Harry to continue talking with Marlene. "Mr. Potter is under investigation for under age magic. It would be best if we could prove he has done nothing since the end of term.""You and I both know that is a false accusation. We were sitting right here when it supposedly happened." Marlene said, clearly losing her patience with the old man's attitude."You are far too valuable—" The old man said."I well know my value to you." Marlene said bitterly, her magic spiking. "But my father wasn't strong enough, and neither were you. It took another Potter to do your job for you didn't it? Greatest wizard since Merlin my foot!"Hermione moved behind the angry witch, while Daphne stepped beside her aunt.Dumbledore removed his glasses and pinched his nose. "That is not my point." He said softly and put his glasses back on. "Madam Bones is aware of the false nature of the charges, but the Minister is using his authority to press this to trial.""So there will be a trial?" Harry yelled, his magic demanding he move into the small space between them, brushing against Marlene as he did so.A second later Hermione pulled Marlene a few feet back, away from the angry young wizard."Stop!" Daphne's cold voice rang out, and when there was silence she continued. "As the Lady of this house, and thus your Hostess, I will not allow a discussion of this import to take place in my kitchen."The Headmaster was the first to recover after blinking at her several times. "Where shall we have this discussion, Mistress Black?" His tone was slightly condescending, but far more pleasant than a moment ago."We shall retire to the parlor, which is what the room is for." She answered immediately."But my mother." Sirius said."I shall speak with her." Daphne answered and continued as though she had planned this in detail days ago. "Hermione love, could you fashion the tea? With whatever finger foods you can locate? Just like our lessons… The rest of you will discuss nothing of more import than Quidditch or the weather.""I'll help her." Ginny said quickly and went with Hermione to the cupboards.Harry Potter was in awe of his new Lady. Just this morning she had been a pile of goo in his bed, then shown him some important issues with his spell casting, healed him from a potentially grave wound, and was now directing Elevenses for the Headmaster. No wonder Hermione had fallen for this wonderful woman, he wanted to drag her up to their room this instant."Well, I believe the Wasps have a fair chance of the cup this season." The Headmaster said. Sitting in the nearest chair and straightened his robe."Their Keeper really isn't all that good when Chasers get close." Remus said, "Now the Tornado's Keeper seems to be everywhere."Harry wanted to help Hermione, but as 'Lord Potter' that was obviously not something he should do, so he looked to Sirius for clues, but he was busy staring after his Betrothed as she strode through the formal dining room and into the parlor. "Keep your eyes off her ass." Harry said instead.The Headmaster laughed as did Nym and Marlene. Sirius turned to Harry and his mouth gaped open but he didn't manage to actually say anything.Daphne verified quickly that her appearance was immaculate before confronting the portrait of the former Lady Black. The curtain seemed to resist her hand at first, but then the family magic identified her ring and it slid easily along the bar."Who dares disturb me?" Walburga asked."Lady Black, I am Daphne Deirdre Greengrass, Betrothed of Lord Black's HEIR." She said the last word firmly and clearly so there would be no confusion that she was going to marry Sirius!Walburga stared at her in shock for a moment and then fell into a chair, her wild hair beginning to straighten itself. "Sirius has a son?""No my lady." Daphne said. "Lord Black has designated his Godson, who does carry blood of House Black in his veins, being the grandson of your own Aunt, Dorea Potter nee Black, as his Heir, unless he does beget children of his own."Walburga stood quickly, "That would be the half-blood Potter boy.""Yes, my Lord Potter." Daphne said sharply to prevent her from insulting Harry."Was it you the house deemed worthy of defending?"Daphne gave a shallow curtsy before answering in a chilling icy voice. "Correct Lady Black. Twice I have been beset by young males of the Weasley family. In the first instance I shielded a minor hex and the wards turned the idiot into a giant slug! In the second I walked through a doorway that had been cursed by different boys, it vanished my clothes!""WHAT!""Yes, it did, fortunately I had my wand." Daphne continued, still in her icy calm voice. "That's when the wards restrained them, and I began cursing. Now you must understand I was a bit incensed.""I would think so." The portrait said, entranced by the story."So first, I transfigured their heads into tree stumps, without eyes, and infested with bugs. Next I vanished their clothes, castrated them, magically of course, then tarred and feathered them. I think I summoned beaters bats to take out further frustration, but my Betrothed pulled me into the Heir Suite and I'm not quite sure what happened at the end.""Oh you poor dear. So what punishment have they received?""Well apparently the boys were targeting my aunt, Marlene McKinnon, it was her room I was leaving. She is, um… influential in the D.M.L.E., and there was also an Auror in the house. Aunt Marlene had the memory of my nudity removed from the male's minds, except my Betrothed of course. But as to punishment? They were returned to their parent's home, where their magic was bound down to a mere ten percent by their father.""Why were they not imprisoned?""First they were guests of Lord Black, and my 'punishment' is being considered sufficient, or they have yet to discover it, I am unsure. Secondly they are not of age. Aunt Marlene has warned their parents they will be arrested for the next incident, no matter how innocent it seems.""He cannot offer to guest just anyone for that specific reason. I've been trying to tell my son that he needs help. That damned prison has harmed him, I fear beyond repair." Walburga said and started crying."We agree, and have enlisted Cousin Andromeda's help in securing a mind healer for him.""Thank you, please have him speak with me."Daphne gave another short curtsy, "Certainly, though it shall have to be soon, I fear we must abandon the house.""Why?""We are unable to summon elves loyal to us, and the resident one merely issues insults and departs. We will have nothing to eat and a mountain of dirty clothes." Daphne lamented, slowly shaking her head in sorrow. She was fairly surprised at how easy the portrait was to manipulate."KREATURE!" Walburga shrieked."Mistress?" The crazy elf said and then saw Daphne. "What does butt sniff—""Shut it." Daphne said drawing her long dagger from her boot. "I am the Lady of this House and you will treat me as such. Any further insults and you will not hang on the wall with your honored ancestors!"The house reacted immediately to her claim, the crest over the fireplace glowed and Daphne was briefly encompassed by the family magic. It retreated immediately, but then the whole house groaned, as though relaxing from a great weight being lifted."No." Kreature said, all fight evaporating at the firm commands from someone his magic wouldn't allow him to ignore."This house is a disgrace," Daphne continued. "Must I purchase new elves to do a proper job or will you perform your duty!""Kreature will serve the Noble Lady." He said, standing again, but not looking at Walburga's portrait."One must always be aware where our loyalties lie. We shall serve the lady of the house." Walburga said."What should Kreature be doing?""Start with cleaning this room, we are having tea and a discussion of some import. Then resupply the kitchen and prepare lunch. After we have eaten lunch, see me for your next instruction.""Yes Mistress Black." The elf said and vanished."Well done Lady Black." Walburga said.Daphne curtsied to the portrait. "I merely claim it by proxy at this time, though obviously it is sufficient for the wards to acknowledge me. Though, unless things change with your elder son, it will fall to me.""If he is not too far into his whiskey, I would like to speak with him civilly.""I believe he is currently sober, however I shall remain present to moderate. Is that acceptable?""It is.""Then I must depart for now." Daphne said and walked towards the formal dining room, to find the doorway crowded by those trying to watch her interaction with the infamous portrait. She froze when she saw how astonished they were and laughed, a light glorious thing to Harry.The sound broke them from their shock, Hermione pushed her way between Sirius and Harry, levitating the steaming tea service over their heads and onto the freshly polished table. Ginny followed in her wake, carrying a platter of hard tea biscuits.When they were all in the Parlor, Daphne spoke to Sirius. "Your mother would like to have a conversation with you, while you are sober. I will be present to moderate. After we are done here however.""Um, yes." Sirius said. "How did you do that?""By acting as I was taught." She said and gestured to the newly cleaned and fluffed couches for him to take a seat. "Since you have no wife, and I am the betrothed of your heir, the responsibility as hostess and manager of the property falls to me. I dare say that since your mother passed away there has been no one to accept that burden.""No," Sirius said, suddenly somber and thoughtful as he took his seat.Hermione and Ginny had been busy filling teacups and offering biscuits to those already seated. When Daphne took her seat, between Harry and Sirius, her cup was already there, prepared just as she liked it.She picked it up and after a brief temperature check, sipped and watched over it to make sure the others were behaving properly. Ginevra was not doing very well, but Hermione was whispering to her so she would survive her first formal tea.When the initial cups were empty and a few were working on their second she spoke up again. "Since there are several matters, which will affect all present, I believe it is necessary to briefly state recent changes. First, I am Betrothed to Harry Potter, who was named the Heir of House Black. Hermione Granger is Lady Designate for House Potter, but currently bears the Consort ring for that house. Ginevra Weasley is a Ward of House Potter and Lord Potter has paid for her new wardrobe and school tuition. I believe that covers the changes in the last few days of which you may not have been aware of Headmaster.""What of the difficulties with the Weasleys?" Marlene asked to bring that topic up."Yes, thank you Aunt Marlene." She said turning to the Headmaster. "Two days ago Ronald Weasley attempted to kidnap Consort Potter at wand point. He said she was his whore and he would have both of us.""What!" Harry said, not having heard this before. He jerked his arm, spilling his tea on himself.Before he could react Kreature was there, two snaps of his fingers and the mess was cleaned up and Harry's cup was safely on the table.Hermione settled Harry the quickest way possible. She sat on his lap and kissed him."We of course told him no." Daphne continued, ignoring the snogging beside her, "and he then cursed me. I shielded it, and the House Wards transfigured him into a giant slug. He was removed shortly after that by Lord Black and taken home along with his mother.""I will not tolerate this." Harry said, though it came out in a slightly dazed whisper."We must learn to forgive, especially our friends." The Headmaster said."Headmaster." Hermione said, softly and without anger, still firmly in Harry's lap. "A friend does not abandon you when you are forced to participate in something against your will. A friend is willing to listen when an issue comes up, instead of yelling and threatening to hit you.""What?" Harry said sharply."Ronald said he would beat her up if she came near you, back in third year when you were fighting over the broom Lord Black purchased for you." Daphne said."Merlin, whatever made me think he was my friend?" Harry said, putting his forehead on Hermione's shoulder and hugging her."And the other incident?" Marlene prompted."Yes," Daphne said after placing her hand gently on Harry's back. "Last night I helped Aunt Marlene to bed, she was exhausted from skipping lunch and guarding us all day in Diagon. Anyway, when I exited her chamber to go to the Heir suite, the twins had cursed the door. My clothes vanished and they were there gawking at me!""Oh, my." The Headmaster said, his legs trembling slightly."The House wards restrained them, and then I cursed them a bit, before Lord Potter dragged me into the Heir suite.""And then it got me." Ginny said. "I'd gone into Miss McKinnon's suite to fetch a chair for her to sit in, and my clothing also vanished when I exited the room.""We were unaware of the cause of Miss Greengrass' nudity until that moment." Tonks said. "I was able to dispel the curse on the door shortly after that.""I had Auror Tonks, who has her license, remove the details of that vision from the males in the house, except for Lord Potter. I would have done it myself, but was concerned as I was so exhausted. Mr. Potter asked for the memory of Ginevra's nudity be removed from his mind, a very noble request on his part, which was honored. Auror Tonks and Remus Lupin delivered them home, where their father bound their magic down to a mere ten percent."Hermione had slid back into her own chair, but was holding one of his hands tightly, while Daphne had the other one cradled in her lap. "Two days in this house, and my ladies have been attacked on each of them." Harry said. "I will not tolerate this, they deserve to feel safe where they live. I have an offer to move to Castle McKinnon, which I will take if my ladies desire.""Mr. Potter, Ladies." The Headmaster said. "I agree you should feel safe, that is certainly one of my goals. I was unaware of the extent of these issues, we can certainly assign alternate accommodations at school. Mr. Black can you explain how my request to associate Miss Greengrass with Mr. Potter ended in a Betrothal?"Sirius finished his third cup of tea, seemingly unsatisfied with it as he was looking into the dregs in disgust. He sighed and placed both cup and saucer on the table before looking up. "When I made it to Gringotts to speak with the goblins, I discovered there was an outstanding contract." He glanced at Daphne who felt suddenly apprehensive. "A contract that would have applied to me, except magic detected one of the clauses had been triggered and it moved on to the next eligible male of Black descent-Draco Malfoy."

Chapter 14"Why did it skip you?" Remus asked, raising his eyebrows.The answer was nearly a minute in coming and stunned them all. "I'm sterile.""I've always wondered why there weren't a lot of Black bastards running around." Marlene said, which made Sirius bark a laugh if not anyone else."I was a bit reckless." Sirius said with a shrug. "I never thought about that, maybe it was my magic telling me it didn't matter. So anyway, it didn't apply to me, though it had fallen to Draco Malfoy. When I named Harry my Heir he superseded Draco on the contract. I contacted Malcolm and we started re-working it, with Marlene and Hermione giving us input. Hermione insisted that there be one out-clause that would not cause any harm to them. And that she, or rather Lady Potter, be responsible for that decision. Since she clearly knows my Godson better than any of us, we took her advice.""Thank you." Harry said, with Daphne echoing him a moment later."So Harry, you will become Lord Black at some point. Whether I live another year or a hundred, though I guess I could allocate myself a nice stipend and retire to the Black island in French Polynesia." Sirius said.There was a rush to Sirius' chair to hug him. Harry, Hermione and Daphne each gave him a warm hug."Now as to the trial." Dumbledore said after everyone collected themselves."I will be at his side." Daphne said. "It is my right."Dumbledore bowed his head in acknowledgment and then continued. "We have enough legal presence to certainly enable that. I myself will stand as your barrister, I have managed to persuade about thirty members, by reminding them of favors I have done for their families over the years, to return to our faction. With Miss Greengrass at your side, the neutral faction is also likely to vote in your favor.""So, if it comes to a vote, it will be close." Marlene said."I believe so, yes.""I'll have to sit my proxy." Marlene said."How do I appoint one?" Harry asked. "Tonks, can I offer it to your mother?""Proxies may only be appointed during normal sessions, and there will not be one before the trial. Though you can certainly offer it to Madam Tonks." Dumbledore said. "Now Fudge may not be aware of the charges being false. He is relying on his Senior Under-Secretary, a Madam Umbridge, to advise him. I strongly believe it is she who fabricated the charge to begin with. And she may be behind the smear campaign against us that I have finally stopped.""Could it have been your success at stopping that, that triggered this?" Remus asked.Dumbledore straightened his glasses. "I hadn't thought of that, but yes, it is possible.""So the trial?" Harry asked."Yes, you will enter and sit in the accused chair. It may form chains to hold you, but should not.""Chains?" Hermione asked."Magic restraining ones." Nym said. "Madam Bones will assign me and Kingsley to guard you. With your Betrothed at your side you must have a female guard as well. I can disable the chains.""But as a Lord he can bypass that chair entirely." Sirius said. "Just touch your ring to the Ministry seal on the back of it. Though you will have to stand throughout then.""Really?" Marlene said. "I was unaware of that.""Yes, Pollux Black did it in the 1400's. If I remember correctly." Dumbledore said."The initial defense is simply that Mr. Potter did not cast the spell as he was not there?" Nym asked."Yes, but in that we have our first problem. We cannot reveal where he actually is." Dumbledore said."I think we're going about this the wrong way, there is a much better defense available to us. How about the fact he is legally an adult?" Hermione asked."He took up his ring after the incident, Love." Daphne said."No." Hermione said firmly. "He's legally been an adult since his Magical Guardian, Albus Dumbledore." She pointed at the Headmaster who looked surprised. "The Headmaster of his school." She kept her finger pointed at the surprised old man. "And the Ministry of Magic's senior representative, Barty Crouch Senior, insisted he participate in a tournament reserved for Of Age Students!""Oh my." Marlene said. "Can I kiss her Harry?""Brilliant!" He said in a daze, astonished no one had thought of this.Hermione blushed quite prettily and turned to face the Headmaster, while Marlene licked her lips. "Well? That made him an adult. Didn't it?""Yes, I believe it would have." Dumbledore nodded quickly several times. "I'll need to check the register in the Ministry. It should show that date.""Now, if none of this gets the trial tossed out I will reveal myself." Marlene said. "None will challenge my word, as a Hit Witch, vouching for what happened, the charges shall be dismissed.""But only as a last resort." Harry said. For some reason he was standing and looking into her blue eyes until she nodded. And then with a mischievous smile the tall blonde stood and snatched Hermione from her seat beside Harry, hugging her, pausing briefly, their lips millimeters apart.Hermione lifted herself to press her lips firmly against the tall woman's, and her hands went to the back of her neck, pulling them tighter together."Oh." Harry said, feeling himself grow painfully hard in his pants, while Daphne moved in front of him, taking his hands and placing them on her stomach.Everyone else froze at the exquisite sight of the two beautiful women locked together."Madam!" Dumbledore managed to get out a minute later causing them to part."We need to talk." Marlene said in a husky voice, not looking at anyone else."Yes, talk." Hermione said, a bit dazed, but she released the taller woman's neck and pulled her towards a corner of the sitting room.Marlene tried to redirect them up the stairs, but the brunette tightened her hold on the woman's hand and kept her moving to the corner. "Not that kind of talk, though I like the eagerness." She said with a grin."Merlin." Harry whispered, echoed by Sirius, while the others seemed to be mesmerized.}-{The Headmaster cleared his throat. "Well then, yes. I'll wander off to the Ministry of Magic's labyrinth of bureaucracy and endeavor to locate that proof of Mr. Potter's coming of age. If I'm not back in a few days don't despair I can always call Fawkes."With a sudden burst of flame the aforementioned immortal bird landed on his pet's shoulder and then vanished with the colorful man."Woah." Sirius said while the rest stood in shock at the sudden departure of the Headmaster."Sirius," Harry said, stepping beside Daphne. "The only part of that tale I believe is that you're shooting blanks.""What?" Remus said."I have been greatly disappointed by the vast majority of adults in my life. From the Headmaster's decision to drop me on a doorstep in November, to the atrocious favoritism in our school and your petty bickering with Snape. The only adult who has made an actual effort to explain things to me is secluded with my witch, somewhere I can't think of at the moment.""Hermione used a strong Notice Me Not, ward." Daphne added. "And no, I have no idea where they are, I just remember seeing the first rune she traced with her wand. Though the wards tell me they are in the house and safe.""Harry." Sirius said, but drifted off."I'm tired of being manipulated and forced into things." When Daphne's hand tightened on his he turned to her, "I have no quarrel with you." He said quickly and turned back to his godfather. "I believe you created that document whole cloth with Malcolm to free yourself of this responsibility. While he likely profited from the large bribe you used to convince him to go through with it. If you've been sterile for years Malfoy would have been notified and he would have been bragging about it constantly.""Ahh," Daphne said, catching on to what Harry was saying. "And your stipend is already allocated and filed with Gringotts. Yes, Harry I believe you are correct. So when shall you abdicate the title you have avoided since getting yourself sorted into Gryffindor?""I…" Sirius said and slumped onto the couch, holding his head. "Why are you all in Azkaban with me?""Oh Merlin." Remus said."I'll go get my mum." Nym said, heading out the door quickly."What's wrong with my son?" the portrait of Walburga Black asked from across the room."Remus, get him into his bed, Dreamless Sleep should be best." Daphne said and pulled Harry to the portrait while Remus levitated the dazed Head of House Black. "Stay with us Ginny." She called over her shoulder when the ginger looked confused."Lady Black, may I introduce my betrothed? Harry James Potter-Black.""Lord Potter-Black." Walburga intoned formally and gave him a deep curtsy. "My son, please.""We don't know." Daphne said. "When Harry confronted him on his recent actions his head appeared to hurt and then he seemed to become delusional. I've asked his friend Remus to put him to bed with a Dreamless Sleep potion. Andromeda should be here to provide a Healer's opinion soon.""I don't need a healer, that's a clear sign of excessive obliviation." The portrait said. "Ask the ginger bint, she knows something." Walburga continued, pointing at Ginny who stood several feet behind them."What did you do to my godfather?" Harry said, spinning around."No." Ginny said, shaking her head so hard her hair hit her in the face."If not you, whom?" Daphne asked.Ginny started crying but didn't move."Come with me." Daphne said. She took the terrified girl's wrist tightly in her hand. "We'll discuss this in private Harry. Come find me in thirty minutes in our suite." She added over her shoulder as she dragged the unresistant girl along with her.When they reached the 4th floor she went to the door opposite her aunt's room. "I want you to move into this room." Daphne said as she pushed the door open. She hadn't ever seen it, but it was the on the Heir floor and should be equivalent to the room her Aunt had moved into."Oh." Ginny said, looking at the bare room."I will have Kreature clean it and you can help decorate." Daphne said without pause changing the ginger's frown into a trembling smile."So you're in charge here now?" Ginny asked when the door to the empty room closed them inside.Daphne conjured a pair of stiff-backed wooden chairs and gestured the younger witch into one. She sat and straightened her dress before answering. "A Pureblood household is run like a Medieval manor. The Lord of the house, in this case Sirius, controls the broad picture, politics, armies, allies and enemies. But the Lady of the house, which doesn't currently exist, is responsible for the home itself. Everything from keeping it in good repair, making sure there is food for the winter and supplies in the house to hosting guests. Since I am the Heir's Lady, that duty and responsibility falls to me.""What's it like being with Harry.""No." Daphne answered a bit harsher than she intended, making the girl look up in fright. "Sorry, I did not mean to make that seem like an attack. You must get rid of this fixation on Harry Potter. The boy you envision is not the real one, but made of mist and fancy.""But.""No," she said again and this time it was as she intended, soft but firm. "I have been with him, he is to be my husband, but such things are intensely private and I will not break his trust by revealing it. I shall answer as I would for my sister Astoria, who is your age.""Um, OK.""This is not something to enter into casually. Our magic will entwine with the wizard, judge him, and if the two magics are compatible, can lock you together for life."Ginny gasped."So you must think hard on it before taking that step. Will this person be someone you want to hang around for a century, do they have prospects for supporting you, or can you support them? Do you want to support them?""Mum never…" Ginny said but trailed off."Your mother told you that Harry could force you into anything, which is correct, but you should realize that only the most sadistic of men would do so. Do you place my future husband in amongst them?""No, Harry's great, he saved me.""Yes, but he saved you as his best friend's little sister. And that is where your fantasy Harry Potter hangs. He did not risk his life to save Ginevra Weasley. He went to save Ron Weasleys little sister.""Oh." Ginny said and tears started down her cheeks."I do not hate you, but I will not lie to you to make you feel better. Too often that causes more harm than the truth. Harry does not love you, and his magic is not seeking yours. You should seek other prospects and then discuss them with myself or Hermione. Not with Harry, we will know far more about the person than he does. He will make the final decision, as you are his Ward, but that will be on our recommendation.""Why is this so difficult?" She cried."Because you have been lied to.""By my mother, yes." The ginger said and took the conjured handkerchief the blonde girl handed her.When Ginny was calmer Daphne pushed her point. "You know something and we must have that information. I saw your look when Remus and Nym were discussing taking the twins home. Will you tell me what that was about?""Yes." She blurted, but then spent a minute collecting her thoughts. "I saw my mum obliviate Sirius once, it was right after we got here, before Hermione or you arrived. She then told him he wanted to find a way to pass the Lordship of House Black to someone else and then leave, never to return again.""The bitch!" Daphne blurted making Ginny flinch. "I'm sorry, my ire is not aimed at you. We are not responsible for our parents, or I would be in Azkaban for what mine has done."Ginny nodded and continued after a moment to gather her thoughts. "Mums always told me that I need to be willing to use spells or potions to get the man I want. She did. And she tells the boys the same, at least Ron and the twins. I was too young when Bill and Charlie were living in the house to know. Percy, I'm not sure of. He's always to strict and follows the rules, something's not right there either, but I don't think it's the same."Daphne was so shocked she was unable to respond for a minute as the young Ward of House Potter looked at her. "Do you understand that is illegal? To use either potion or spell to control another is an automatic trip to Azkaban. That's what the Imperius Curse is."Ginny shrugged, "We're supposed to trust our parents right? I didn't understand it was wrong until…""What your brothers did to me, yes I know.""What can we do?""We'll start by telling my aunt, she can decide how to proceed, but odds are very good your mother and brothers will be heading to an island in the North Sea. Now let's see if my connection to the wards will tell me where she is yet?"Daphne closed her eyes, reaching out for that feeling that had come fleetingly earlier. There it was, she flinched when it felt like a birds beak clamped onto her shoulder, though nothing was there. Oh, her aunt was still in the parlor, but since she couldn't tell where she had to still be under the ward. Harry was standing in the corner looking through some curio's in a cabinet.She stood screaming, "NO HARRY!" And vanished in a crack that made the house tremble with the force behind it.}-{Hermione built a quick ward in the corner with several carefully placed taps of her wand.Marlene sat and observed her spell-work carefully. She had never really seen the prodigy in action, working only from second hand reports from her niece. It looked like she had understated the girls skill if anything. When Hermione's notice-me-not ward shimmered into existence the Hit Witch added a silencing spell.The brilliant brunette sat only a few inches away and met her eyes. "Let me make this clear, if it wasn't already, I am in charge here. Your magic wants Harry, his wants you. I'm perfectly willing to take you as my lover, I can't wait to experience your Parseltongue.""What?" Marlene said, suddenly nervous."It's a family trait, I know my Daph has it, the world knows my Harry has it. I just wish I could bloody learn it!""Oh, yes." Marlene said and leaned forward on the couch."We're here because you decided to kiss me." Hermione reminded her. "I'm not going to dance around this. We have to wait a while. Right now you're an authority figure that can officially instruct and guide us. The minute there is a hint that you're in Harry's bed, it will fall apart. Once Harry is recognized as a leader, and we've learned enough to take the fight to the nose-less-wanker, then no one will bat an eye when you join us.""How are you so certain he…""I know Harry. I can tell you precisely how he'll react. If you and I did go to your room right now he wouldn't say a word against us, though Daphne would drag him to our room to distract him." She shrugged. "Yes, I'm certain. I meant what I said in the heat of the moment downstairs, when you were manipulating me. You'll not fight alone. We'll be there, but he and I have to get better or you and Daph will just be hampered by guarding us.""You know." Marlene said, suddenly smiling. "You're everything Daphne said you were."Hermione blushed at the compliment, but only glanced away from her for a moment. "I've got to keep Harry alive so we can have a future. That's always meant I needed to learn far faster than everyone else. I'll not slack off just because you are well ahead of me.""You should start with Occlumency.""Daph started me on that back in third year. I'm well into my mindscape.""Really?" Marlene said, her eyebrows rising dramatically."Yes, and I gave Harry the beginners book before summer, but he hasn't gotten far into it. We need to get settled down so we can study. Are we safe here now or should we leave?""I'd like to search the house, it feels cursed, perhaps with Daphne asserting her authority we can learn something from the portraits.""That was brilliant wasn't it?" Hermione said, beaming at her lover's initiative and actions."Yes, it was well done." Marlene said. "I couldn't have pulled it off. As much as I hate the bastard she learned how to do that from her father."And then the house shook yet again and they jumped to their feet. The Notice-Me-Not Ward did not prevent them from seeing the room, just stopped others from noticing them sitting there.Harry was across the room at the curio cabinet with the door open and his hand inside. Daphne appeared in the middle of the room with a blinding light and a deafening thunderclap. He jerked at the sound...}-{Harry Potter was bored, he'd spoken with the portrait briefly, but she seemed terrified of him so he took pity on her and bid her a good day. He had at least fifteen minutes before Daphne had asked him to meet her. Hermione and Marlene were still missing.That brought him back to why they were missing, that kiss. It had taken his breath away just to witness it. What could be taking them so long? No he was sure they hadn't left this room and Hermione had distinctly said they were going to talk.He got distracted by the curio cabinet in the corner. It had been polished and dusted along with the rest of the room, but still seemed dirty to him. There were hundreds of little objects, made of metal, stone, and wood. There didn't seem to be two of anything. A blue crystal bird was on the top shelf, its wings poised to take flight, while beneath it ranged a collection of rings, some with stones, but most just a metal band.What was the history of these things? Who had worn or made those rings? Had any of it been written down for later generations? And what of similar things for the Potters? He hadn't looked through the list from Gringotts, but there were several properties, and then the vault he couldn't access yet. What was in it?He squatted to look at the lower shelves easier, a large pendant, with an embossed snake in the shape of a capital S caught his attention. It reminded him of something, where had he seen that before?Without realizing it his hand had opened the door. Normally it wouldn't have opened, long ago having been sealed by the Head of the family. But he was the Heir, and the family magic had deemed Sirius unfit from when he'd first rejected the family decades ago. Since he hadn't done anything to redeem himself in its view, Harry held the authority of the Lord, as Daphne held that of the Lady.The magic sealing the cabinet flickered over his Black ring and then opened without further protest.Just as he was about to pick up the locket there was a tremendous crack behind him. He flinched and his fingers brushed the locket and his forehead exploded in pain.

Chapter 15"Harry!" Hermione yelled and ran across the room, past Daphne who was still recovering from the forced apparition.He was twisting on the ground, both hands clenched over his head, from his right wrist dangled the open locket. Blood was coming from his famous scar as though he'd just been slashed with a sword.Daphne reached them and had her hands on one of his shoulders, though he continued to twist, even with both girls trying to hold him."Hold it still!" Marlene yelled as she paused and knelt by Daphne's feet. She came up holding Daphne's dagger. "The locket, hold it still!" Marlene said.It was then she realized the locket was hissing at them. Hoping her companions could understand what it was saying Hermione climbed on top of Harry, and grabbed his right arm, with Daphne's help they got it away from his bloody face and on the carpet."Nooo" he hissed out, "get out."Daphne grabbed his wrist near the locket and pushed it into the carpet as hard as she could. "Shut it up!" She screamed at it.Hermione saw an eyeball leering around inside the locket just before the dagger plunged into it. With a sickening squelch, black ichor started seeping from the locket. A scream erupted from the locket, as though a man had just been stabbed in the parlor.She and Daphne quickly got the chain off of his wrist and pulled him half-way across the room. Marlene stood over the locket, still pinned to the carpet by the long dagger. She hissed at the now silent locket and then jerked the dagger free."What in Merlin's name is going on here?" Remus said, he was at the foot of the stairs, wand in hand.Ginny was at the very highest part of the stairs she could be and still see through the rails into the room."It's still attacking him." Daphne said."Graveyard." Harry struggled to say."Like when you were in the graveyard?" Hermione asked, holding one bloody hand, the other pressed to his cheek."Yessss, struggle.""When your wands matched?"He didn't speak but nodded sharply."He's fighting another battle of wills." Hermione explained to Daphne and Marlene. "My Legimancy isn't good enough to help him." She cried."Mine is." Daphne said."As is mine." Marlene added, though was completely ignored by the two girls."Can I link with you?" The brunette asked."Girls!" Marlene said sharply."It's Harry!" They both replied to her and then drew their wands.They'd done this a few times, but never under such stress. It took them an extra minute to focus enough for their minds to connect. Once they were together Daphne turned to Harry, who was now being held down by Remus's considerable strength.Marlene cast a quick cleaning spell on his face to remove the blood, then pulled his eyes open, they were glowing red and another voice seemed to be trying to use his throat."Legillimens!" Daphne cast, pushing as much of her magic into it as she could.NO, Was the first thing they heard when they arrived in their lover's mind. It wasn't a voice they recognized so had to be snake-lips.We're here Harry, Hermione projected.Get away, he's stronger than in the graveyard. He answered and then they saw him, struggling to get out from under a pale-skinned man.Daphne was there in an instant, atop the man, with her hands locked under his throat. She wrenched up, which would have broken a human's neck, instead he merely rose up a few inches.Foolish girl, I am immortal! He said, one arm coming up to grab her.That gave Harry an opportunity, he twisted to his side, causing no-nose to fall towards the side he'd just lifted his arm from. He crashed to the ground, with Daphne atop him and Harry got both of his hands on the man's face, pushing hard.Hermione Granger had always been a prodigy, she'd pushed herself since before she could remember to learn everything. Occlumency had been one of her more recent passions, she'd read what they said about it, incorporated it and then innovated farther. When her mother made a suggestion she'd tried it, and succeeded beyond her imagination. Here in Harry's mind was one of the few places it was possible to see what she'd done. Instead of a single Hermione, there were sixteen of her.They didn't quite look the same either, each was dressed slightly differently. Normally each of these focused on a single task, often for days or weeks until a solution could be found. Now they were all focused on this single issue.Quickly the answer came to them, they were in Harry's mind, that made it like a dream, and in a dream anything was possible!Four of them charged the fray, where Mr. no humor was winning. They were able to push the pile over, grabbing snake-lips limbs. They were joined by more of their sisters, until even his enhanced 'body' was unable to move.Two of them imagined they were holding Daphne's dagger and it showed up in their hands. They charged the scene. Hermione, in most of her mind was not a combatant, but when it came to her loves, she was a different witch. She didn't hesitate to stab into the pale skin of the being.Instead of blood, it was filled with black ichor.NO, you fools! I cannot be killed!While her seconds were hacking at the imaginary body of Tom Riddle, Hermione Prime focused on the Sword of Gryffindor. She may not be able to summon the actual blade, but Harry knew what it was and what it could do, that should be enough within his mind.Her hand wrapped around the hilt of the heavy sword. She felt herself judged by the blade, so this wasn't some imaginary copy. With greater confidence she moved around to where the head of this thing was.He'd been mangled, dozens of cuts and gashes marred his white skin. One of her ichor covered seconds looked up, This is filled with his memories!The two with blades started poking holes in him randomly.Daphne focused a minute and her dagger appeared in her hand, looking more substantial than the ones Hermione had created. She plunged it into the beings heart. But it didn't seem to bother him any more than the other wounds did.Harry hold his head,  Hermione Prime said while standing over the thrashing and cursing cranium.I cannot be killed, I am immortal!Of course you can,  Hermione Prime said. She felt another hand cover hers and redirect the blade to the things red eye. It plunged down, into the red orb of Harry's attempted murderer.Tom Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort, let out a scream that sounded just like the locket, and to Harry, the diary as well. The thrashing body suddenly became still.Thank you Godric. She thought, or thought she thought. She laughed at the absurd idea and tried to pull the sword free.Let me help. Harry said, standing beside her. Thank you ladies. He said, and paused, looking over Tom Riddle's corpse as four more Hermiones rushed into his mind.Hermione love, why are there more of you? Daphne said, wiping her face with her sleeve.Occlumency, meet my mind. She said and gestured with one hand, the other still holding the sword.Harry put his hand on the hilt of Godric's blade. They felt a jolt of magic go through them and then heard a voice.My lord Gryffindor has chosen an excellent lady Gryffindor.The body vanished into a pool of ichor, the Hermiones seemed to be trying to bathe in it.Damn it! Daphne said to the duo holding the famous sword. Now you're Gryffindor!What?Didn't you hear that voice? The sword just proclaimed you Lord and Lady Gryffindor.Really? What does that mean?Let's get back to the outside world. Mine, are your seconds done feasting?They looked over the floor where several of the girls looked to be drunk, two had passed out, and a full dozen looked high.Yep, this is going to take some sorting. She said. Everyone grab a sister and head home, twenty four hour break and then we start sorting this mess out.Yay! Several of the more cognizant girls said and got to their feet, before turning to help the others.It took a few minutes, but Harry's mind was soon down to just the three of them.With a gesture from Daphne they were clean. She came close to them. I don't trust that sword, but give me a kiss and we'll meet you back outside.Harry and Hermione moved their joined hands behind them.I shall not harm one who has proven their loyalty to mine. The sword said causing Daphne to flinch. But she got a brief kiss from Harry and then tried the same with Hermione, but she dug her free hand into the blonde's tresses. Forcing a deeper kiss, until they parted with a loud pop.Loyal girls deserve real kisses, she breathed and then turned her to face Harry again. Try again.He'd released Godric's sword, as Hermione released their blonde lovers hair, he grabbed it and kissed her properly.I'll see you two outside. Hermione thought and then vanished, taking the sword with her.I'm sorry, Daphne said when they parted. The wards told me there was something dangerous in the case, and then somehow I apparated to the parlor.He kissed her again, fairly short by Hermione's standards. Thank you for trying, sometimes my life is like this no matter how hard I try. How are you able to get into my mind?Occlumency. Well that's not true, it's Legilimancy that got us here, mine since Hermione's been so focused on her Occlumency and now I know why.He laughed and pulled her into a tight hug, crushing the air from her lungs for a moment. Guess I better get back to reading that book.Yes, she said breathlessly, still catching up from the lung-crushing hug. Outside, and then we all need to talk.Sure, how do we get outside?Like this. She said and vanished from his arms.His world changed in an instant, he groaned in pain and tried to move but everything was sore. The world was a big blur, except for the blonde angel in front of him. Before Marlene could say anything he did. "You're an angel and trust me I need one."She laughed, "let's get those glasses on so you can tell me from my niece."Harry sighed dramatically, "Can't even get a compliment—" he said, but was interrupted when Kreature appeared with a crack on the far side of the room."Master Regulus' locket is gone!" Kreature said in awe. "Finally it is done!" The elf said and began dancing a very bad Irish jig around the room. He made it to the mess on the floor and paused to piss on the locket.When his bladder was apparently empty he came back to himself, straightened his pillowcase and snapped his fingers, cleaning up the mess and leaving a mangled locket lying on the repaired carpet.Kreature scooped it up by the chain and walked over to Marlene, with a bow he presented it to her. "Thank you Lady Paladin." He said. When she put the still dirty dagger through the chain he snapped his fingers, cleaning up the remaining ichor and vanished."That's got to be the craziest elf I've ever encountered." Marlene said.Hermione dove on Harry, hugging him and causing the rest in the room to laugh at her antics."Why am I being smothered?" Harry's muffled voice came from Hermione's considerable cleavage.With an excited squeak she pulled back and gave the surprised boy a thorough kissing. While he was still dazed Daphne gave him equal attention before punching him in the shoulder."Harry Potter, don't you do that to me!""What did I do?" He said, rubbing his shoulder. "And where are my glasses?""I've got them." Ginny said, walking nervously over to them from the stairs. "They were on the ground by the door. I don't think they broke.""So what did I do?" He asked once he had his spectacles on and was sitting up."You don't remember?" Marlene asked, dangling the mangled locket in front of him. When his hand moved to take it she pulled it back. "No, that's how this started. Curious boy needs to learn restraint."Another mischievous smile graced her lips."No." Hermione said firmly, looking up at the standing woman without flinching.Marlene pouted. "Very well you'll have to do it later. As to what happened, you touched this, it opened, and you screamed. Hermione held you still while Daphne kept the locket from moving and I stabbed it with her Goblin blade.""Then we went into his mind and kicked Voldemort's ass." Hermione said and giggled."Why?" Remus asked. "I mean why was he screaming?"Instead of answering she held the dagger above her head, which brought the locket dangling from it, to her eye level. After a minute to inspect it she slid the locket from the blade and into her hand. "It was an artifact of Salazar Slytherin, one which had been cursed. Harry reacted to it, probably because of his famous scar, received from the last descendent of Lord Slytherin himself."She tossed the locket into Harry's lap and held the dagger, hilt first, out to her niece.The boy flinched away from it but it landed on him in spite of his attempt to move. While Daphne took the dagger, gave the blade a quick inspection and then sheathed it in her tall boot."Ha ha." Harry said, picking up the locket after recovering from his fright. "This does look familiar." He said looking at the lid of the locket which was slightly bent, but otherwise undamaged. "And that scream when we killed it, that sounded just like when I stabbed the book in the Chamber.""Really?" all three girls said while Ginny shivered, hugging herself tightly."I know where I saw this, the snake S is the same as it was in the Chamber, and on the tap to open the door. Ginny?" he called, only then realizing she was not taking this twist in the conversation well.Daphne was at her side in an instant, guiding her around the Sword of Gryffindor, which appeared to have entered their life in a very real way, to sit on one of the couches. "It's not your fault, we're just looking for confirmation on what something looks like."Ginny nodded, but turned and buried her face in Daphne's robes. "It's the same." She mumbled, not moving from Daphne's shoulder, though she shivered and held onto the older girl."Kreature," Daphne called and the house-elf appeared in an instant. "Is there a Pensive in the house?""Yes, in the Lord's study Ma'am.""Good. Prepare the other guest room on the Heir floor for Ginevra, move her belongings there.""Yes, Mistress. Lunch is being ready." The old elf said and vanished with a crack."I hope he washed his hands." Hermione said and picked up the sword. "I'll just take this up to our room. And that too I guess." She said taking the destroyed locket from Harry.}-{While she was upstairs, the front door opened and Nym, with her mother Andromeda came in out of a pouring rain. A few quick spells and they were dry."Why are you sitting on the floor?" Nym asked, scratching her head."I seem to end up on it often enough, just getting myself familiar with this one." Harry said and rolled to his feet. "Madam Tonks, thank you for coming. Please do what you can for my godfather and then I have a request of you." He said in a rush."Of course Lord Potter." She said with a curtsy."Sirius has been obliviated." Daphne said, startling everyone with the anger in her words. She gave Ginny a comforting hug and turned her to face the room. "Tell them what you saw.""My mum obliviated him, here in the kitchen just after we got here in July." Ginny said, not looking up from the floor. Daphne allowed her to collapse back into her after that."Mrs. Weasley appears to have retained much of her Prewitt upbringing." Marlene said coldly and then turned to Mrs. Tonks. "I'm Daphne's aunt, Marlene McKinnon.""Don't let her fool you, she's my guardian angel." Harry said."Madam Tonks," Remus said gesturing at the stairs. "He's under a dreamless sleep in the Lord's suite."Nymphadora, you should have told me to leave my sanity at home with your father!"With a chuckle following her she headed up the stairs. "Oh, lunch is ready when you're free." Harry called up the stairs, eliciting a response from Hermione on her way down."I know that silly boy. Oh, hello Nym, is this your mother?"With a laugh Harry headed into the dining room, followed by the rest of his comedy troop. Something was really weird in his head, but he felt happy, lighter, so it had to be good. Right?}-{Lunch was something Harry didn't recognize, but Daphne oo'd "That house elf's got my favorite foods now.""Teach you to take ownership of a house." Marlene said and sat opposite them."So what is it?" Harry asked.Ginny sat next to Daphne, away from Harry."Steak and kidney pudding." Daphne said, digging into her plate. "Oh, he did good, guess I won't replace him just yet."With a chuckle Harry, Ginny and Marlene started eating. The boy hmmed a minute later and decided he liked it as well."Sorry I got distracted by Tonks, both of them." Hermione said as she walked into the room and sat beside Marlene, much to her surprise. Hermione ignored her however to eat her meal.Soon after Nym arrived and sat on Harry's other side. "Mum kicked me out, Remmy is 'assisting' her, though if you hear any rough breathing I wouldn't go investigate. She takes that M.I.L.F. thing way too seriously."Marlene laughed while Harry paused, fork half-way to his mouth, then he shrugged and went back to eating. It wasn't his job to police the adults in his life. And besides, they were adults, it was their choice, unless it was just Nym starting a rumor to get even with her mother for using her first name. Or for giving her that name to begin with. He thought about asking what milf stood for, but wisely decided he'd ask his ladies in private later.Daphne's free hand went to his lap and then between his legs. She did it naturally and smoothly so he hardly registered it until it was far too late. She was cupping his balls through his pants when she finally leaned forward on the table."I think I'll take my Betrothed up to our room to relax. It's been a stressful morning." She said, tugging on his balls briefly before releasing him to stand and wait for him to join her. She turned to Ginny, "Don't forget you've been moved to a different suite. Call for Kreature if you want to change colors or furniture.""Yes, thank you." The ginger said, looking up in adoration at her new savior.}-{"I seem to have absorbed some of Tom's kinky sex memories." She said when they were alone and shivered. "Fuck them out of my head." She ordered."As the lady wishes.""No, I'm not a lady now, I'm a cunt that needs fucking, lots of fucking." She breathed and latched onto his collarbone humming in parseltongue."Oh." He moaned and quickly removed his clothing. She shifted to kissing his mouth after his shirt was removed and they started on her clothes.When he moved her to the bed she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him down with her and grunting as his weight fell on her."Sorry." He said, moving down her body."I don't need foreplay, fuck me."Her scent was already permeating the room, so he lined his cock up with her dripping slit and shoved inside her. They grunted together at the sudden sensation."That's it, now don't stop." She said, her mouth finding his and her hands locking together behind his neck. She moved her legs wide open, as though her ankles were being held at her shoulder height. She couldn't quite get them on the bed without help, but Harry provided that without her asking."Harder," she breathed, snaking her hands between them to tug on her tender nipples.With his grip on her ankles she was completely subject to his whim, and loved it. Sex with Mine was never like this, that was more a meeting of equals."Come on Harry, claim me. Spoil my cunt. Make me never think of another man."He grunted and slowed his pace, slamming his cock into her harder, making her gasp each time he hit her womb."That's it, dominate me. I'm your witch. Shove that cock into my throat."She reached a hand between them and pinched her swollen clit between strokes, just getting it out of the way before he broke her fingers between their pelvis bones. She did it two more times before she came so hard she could only see white for a minute.He kept pounding though while her cunt convulsed around him."Thank… you… Love…" Daphne said, between her continuing gasps.And then he was bathing her womb with his hot cum. "Yes, fill me up."He couldn't speak, sweat was dripping from his nose onto her chest. His thumbs were digging into her ankles fairly hard, he'd surely bruised her insides, and her hips hurt. It was perfect.She wrapped her arms around his back and cooed into his ear while he panted into hers.He didn't seem aware he was still folding her in half, and she wasn't going to mention it, ever. Though she was going to suck him hard immediately and then see where it went. She could still vaguely recall Riddle liked to kill during sex, and that needed to get out of her head."How was that my sexy Slytherin?" he whispered into her ear."Very well done, but I want more.""You insatiable women will be the death of me.""At least you'll die happy. There has to be a position with me on top, show me what Mine does?""That's better." He said, wiping his sweaty cheek on hers and sitting up. "Oh." He said, suddenly realizing he had her ankles in a death grip.She hissed when he let them go, "Well, they'll have to wake up before I do much.""Sorry.""Harry, don't ever apologize for doing something I ask you to do. There was nothing wrong with that fuck, it will just take me a few minutes to recover." She gyrated her hips a little, "And you need some time too. Clean us both up, and me out, without Mine here I would get too slippery I think."Harry found his wand and cast several cleaning spells on them, her pussy was gaping open, his milky seed dripping out, until he cleaned her up, then she was just gaping open and red all over.She shivered as the spell worked inside her and then rubbed her legs, they were still tingling but seemed to be responding."So lie down." She said as she sat up, her hand going to his balls. His cock was only half-hard so once he was on his back she took him into her mouth. Being careful not to rake him with her teeth she swirled her tongue around it and sucked hard, it came to life in her mouth."There we go." She said and he guided her to sit on his cock, facing him. When he was comfortably nestled deep inside her she sighed and looked down at the blissful expression on his face. "So this has to be some basic position, Mine is far too inventive.""Yes, but I like this one a lot." He whispered, his hands caressing up her slim torso to grope her breasts."Ahh, yes. You can pinch my nipples, I like that." She said and tried to sort out how to fuck him in this position. That was definitely the bad side to only having sex with another girl before this. She wasn't a passive lover, she couldn't just lie there. Ok so gyrating is not a lot, thighs, ohh, that's better.Harry started guiding her by lifting her tits up until he nearly fell out of her and then letting her drop with a wet squelching sound."Ok, I've got it." She said and leaned forward, holding his shoulders tightly and started fucking him.His hands left her, searching on the bed over his head and brought back a pillow. She paused and then rocked back, pulling up on his shoulders while he slipped the pillow under them.Then his hands squeezed her breasts sideways, pulling her left nipple down into his mouth. But she stopped him just before he got it inside. "No parseltongue until you've cum." When he nodded she allowed him to drag her the last few inches into his hot mouth.While he started suckling she adapted her new fucking technique to accommodate a tit that had to stay in one place. Fortunately it was large enough to give her some flexibility, and she imagined Mine doing this nearly sitting up.He started shoving his cock up into her as she went down, again they started meeting at her womb, deep inside her. She'd have to get Mine's help to heal her later, and probably him too. But right now it was perfect as they slammed together.Sometime later he released her now distended left nipple and moved to suckle on her right. She kept slamming down on his cock, she was tingling, getting close.Daphne prided herself on being in shape, she could out-duel most opponents simply because they got exhausted. This was an entirely different contest, in which they would both win, the degree of which depended on how much effort they each put into it.She would not be a bad lover."Is this good for you? I like it." She said to him. "Just nod or shake your head."He nodded, as she expected him to, what boy would say he didn't like it. Well she'd get the truth out of him during their Occlumency practice."Oh." She said and he grabbed her hips, to start fucking up into her very fast. She gave up trying to move with him and simply rode his cock to a huge climax. He was biting on her nipple by the time she was done, though he never slowed, never gave her a chance to recover, he hissed the word cum in parseltongue on her nipple and she did just that.This time he followed her, his cock filled her deepest places with his seed.They were both covered in sweat and Daphne couldn't remember what she wanted to forget. It was perfect. "Thank you." She said, kissing his cheek as he released her abused nipple.They lay there relaxing and recovering for a minute or so, before he spoke up."Daphne." He said suddenly serious, he held her shoulders so she could look at him. "I can't believe how quickly you've become an important part of my life. I don't think I'd ever want to push you away.""Harry," she said caressing his cheek. "Tell me that when we're all stinky from a workout, not bathing in the afterglow." His smile turned into a frown and he let go of her shoulders. She kissed the nook between his shoulder and neck, and then followed it up to his ear which she bit gently. "I love Mine, and am nearly in love with you.""So you can say that now but I can't?"She shook her head, making her long hair flop onto his face before she sat up. She placed her red-tipped fingernail between his ribs making him wince. "You show me love in what you do, and you're doing a good job of it so far."Her nail retreated and she sat up on him, slowly caressing her tortured right nipple."Sorry."She looked at him like he was stupid. "What did I tell you last time.""That it was fine. Ok, so I'm not sorry, it was great.""See? And yes it was." She said kissing his cheek and rolling off of him towards the side of the bed. "Shower time, join me." And with that she was gone.

Chapter 16As the four girls still sat at the dinner table Hermione spoke up. "Ginny.""Yes?" the ginger said, still playing with her half-eaten lunch."I'm well aware you're my responsibility and I haven't been available to you. For that I'm sorry. Any commitment Daphne has made on my behalf I'll certainly honor. You can come to me for help if you need it.""Ok," Ginny said, looking up briefly."Do you want something else to eat?" Marlene asked."No, it tastes fine, I just don't feel very hungry after this morning.""If you want to go check out your new room and get it decorated as you like, go ahead." Hermione said."Yes, thanks." Ginny said, scraping the chair on the hardwood floor as she stood. "Miss McKinnon?"Marlene's eyebrow rose but she didn't speak."I need to know that the people my mum and brothers have hurt will be found and helped. Can you do that?""Yes, we can. I'll need an official statement from you, with at least one Auror present." She gestured to Tonks who gave her a two-fingered salute and a cocky smile. "She can at least sign the paperwork. And then we can move.""Can we do that soon?""Sure, if you don't mind postponing your new bedroom, we can do it now. Hermione can serve as your guardian.""Yes, please." Ginny said sitting back down at the table.Marlene swirled her left hand and her dark-wood staff appeared. She grounded the butt on the wooden floor and leaned the tip over the table. The ruby glowed giving them each a red tint."Ginevra Molly Weasley, do you swear the evidence you are about to provide is the truth so far as you know and have personally witnessed?""I Ginevra Molly Weasley so swear.""Hermione Jane Granger, Consort Potter and designated Lady Potter. This girl is a Ward of House Potter, and under age. Do you consent to allow her to present evidence?""I Hermione Jane Granger, do give my permission for this Ward of House Potter to give evidence.""Auror Nymphadora Tonks, shall you witness this evidence?""I shall.""Proceed with your evidence.""On July third, just after we arrived here, I came down to get a drink, it was about midnight or so, my mum and Lord Black were arguing in the kitchen so I froze, the door half open. My mum then obliviated him and told him he needed to get out of Harry Potter's life and should make someone else the next Lord.""Was this the first time you saw her do this?" Marlene asked."No." Ginny said shaking her head."And the previous time?""She obliviated my dad when he was arguing with her about something. He wanted her to get a job to help with the family income, she obliviated him and told him that Dumbledore was giving them money. I don't know if he did or not.""Are you aware of your mother performing any other illegal acts?""Yes." She said, this time starting to cry.Hermione shifted to the chair beside her and took her hand in hers."She told me she used a love potion on dad back in school to get his attention. I've seen her brewing it from time to time so I think she's still giving it to him. She makes it for my brothers too, and was going to give some to Ron so he could rape Hermione. She wanted me to give some to Harry so I could have him. The twins very suddenly got girlfriends last year, all three of the Gryffindor chasers, I'd have them all tested. Percy seems to be different, but is somehow involved as well. I was too young when Charlie and Bill were growing up to know what was happening with them."Hermione's grip had tightened painfully during her long speech, but she didn't interrupt."Is this the extent of your evidence?""Yes, I can't remember anything more."Hermione managed to loosen her grip on the young girls hand."Very well." She said and tapped her staff. Several sheets of parchment appeared on the table, she flipped through it quickly and then turned it to face Ginny. "Read it then we'll each sign."With a quick twirl of her wrist the staff vanished along with the sickly red glow.Once they had all signed it Marlene flipped the stack over and wrote a short message on the back. She signed it and then tapped it with her wand, the message scrambled into complete gibberish.She rolled the stack up and handed it to Nym. "Carry out your orders immediately.""Yes, mum." Nym said with a cheeky grin and strode from the room.}-{Harry finished tying his shoe and smiled at Daphne's back. His girls had done a marvelous job of helping him, now he really needed to get himself sorted out and moving. Since that battle in his head he felt different, as though some great burden had been removed from his shoulders."Daph?"She smiled over her shoulder as she finished brushing her hair out, "What?""Thank you for helping me. I'm going to find that book on Occlumency that Mine gave me and do some more reading. Unless there's something else you think we should be doing?""No, I think that's an important thing. I'll check on the others and see what they're saying about your Godfather." Daph said and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek."Oh, that reminds me, what did Nym mean about a milf?" he asked.Daphne shrugged. "I haven't a clue, though it seemed to be initials for something. We'll have to see if Mine understood her, though I think we all got the impression her mum could be having sex with Remus."He nodded, "Yeah, I got that picture too." He shrugged, "They're both adults. Though if we're in charge of this house is it our responsibility to tell her husband?""No. It isn't, lovers won't be denied, if they wish it they'll find somewhere. I'm sure even if we don't have a suite at school we'll do the same, maybe just for the fun of it."With that thought she left him searching for his trunk. Which he finally found in the back of the closet, and discovered it was empty. Apparently the demented elf had unpacked his trunk, he finally found the books tucked into the nightstand beside the bed. Thinking the elf had the right of it he piled some pillows up and propped himself up in bed.But when he started reading the book he found himself criticizing it for the lack of detail. I can do better than that.And then he was inside a veritable mental fortress that was locking things down faster than he could think of them. Woah, ok now what have I done?Hey Harry, he said to himself.What? Himself?Then he was sitting in a small room, with two stiff wooden chairs, the other chair was occupied by his mirror image.Who are… he found himself saying to the copy, who did the same thing to him. Then they both sighed and sat there looking at one another.This is ridiculous.I agree.So where did you come from?Me? I'm me, where did you come from?Wait, is this like what Mine did?You mean making multiple copies of her mind to… What was she doing with them?Thinking about different things.Yeah.Ok, so it looks like I learned Occlumency from snake-lips.That's a fairly disturbing statement you know Harry.Harry shrugged. Do you dispute the fact?Well no.Let's see if we can get a handle on these defenses then, I don't want to hurt Daph when she tries to test my progress later.Oh, no that would be bad. Look at that thing!Yikes.Maybe we need to somehow mark Daph as safe so all of this just ignores her.That might be easier, and we'll still keep all of these cool defenses!We'll have to add Mine and Lene too.Lene?Marlene, come on Potter keep up with our women!What do you mean?I mean that witch is mine! I can't stand the thought of some other man having her, so I'm going to claim her.Well yeah, I can see your point there. Good idea. It's a pretty cool thing being able to discuss things with yourself!}-{(AN. Warning, Weasleys ahead!)Luna was lounging in the pond on the Weasley side of the forest. She liked the sound of those words so she repeated them, Luna lounging, it was perfect. Well not quite perfect she guessed. Ron was trying to sneak up on her, which was patently impossible to do, she was a seer! Oh, well at least she'd have a little more fun with the pea-sized brain of his before he was arrested.She leaned forward and twisted to stand in one fluid motion, which shifted her torso from leaning back where Ron was aiming to a foot to the left, causing him to miss and fall face first into the pond.Instead of looking at him she stood and climbed the soft earth that made up the bank. She brushed her fingers over her pale ass, knocking some dirt off and stunning Ronald for a moment when he saw her butt.Luna giggled, then wiggled, because it rhymed, and started running away from the Burrow. Ron was soon huffing after her. She loved the feel of the breeze against her bare skin and the slight bounce of her chest at every step.She paused for another one of his breaks. The idiot was holding his wand, while he leaned against a tree catching his breath.The young seer gave him almost two minutes before sending a wandless hex at his wand hand. He swatted the tree, thinking he was being bitten, the tree obligingly snapping the wand in two. "Come on Ronald!" she said wiggling her bare ass at him again.He grunted and charged, like an enraged bull.She laughed again and headed straight for the Burrow. It was time for the raid, she didn't want one Weasley left out.}-{"Come on Penny, focus love." Percy said, trying to hold himself still relative to his fiancée's ass that he was skewering."Working on it." She said, spitting out another of Molly's curly hairs before getting her mouth back to work on the giant hairy cunt."Oh, Percy, you did so well picking this marvelous girl. Only a few more months and you'll be allowed to marry her.""Never heard of this type of bride price." Penny said, between slurps of her tongue."Purebloods can set whatever price they wish dear." Molly explained. "So you have to make me cum three hundred different days, each one with Percy's marvelous cock buried to the hilt in your ass. If he cums before I do, it doesn't count."Penny had a full body shiver at that, and then tensed her ass muscles as hard as she could. Percy shivered, but managed to hold off his climax.}-{The Auror strike team ghosted into the Burrow. The leader was Valerie Norwood, one of the three Hit Witches, along with her were ten female Aurors. They were under a selective notice-me-not spell and anything one of them said would only be heard by the others, wherever they were in the home."You know where to go people, be there." Valerie said softly and stopped in the kitchen. While her team investigated she put up an anti-apparition and anti-portkey ward."Girls room is empty.""Adults room has three present, the mother, Percy and his fiancée. They're involved in sex.""Well, all three are adults, nothing we can arrest them on there. Two of you stay to observe." Valerie said with a shrug."Oh Merlin.""No, you dolt, explain what you've found!" she barked."We're in the twins room. They're working on a potion, in the meanwhile their girlfriends are barely conscious. Each of them has their fist buried in the other.""Again, they're of age, two of you stay to observe, move on.""Now that has to be illegal!"Valerie shook her head and waited for the explanation. Meanwhile she unlatched a secret compartment behind the spice rack. Bingo."Is it legal for a ghoul with a ten inch cock to fuck the daylights out of a sixteen year old girl?""That would be a NO." she said. Adding the vials of lust and love potions to evidence bags. "Tell me how a Ghoul is able to do that? Don't they have like two inch cocks?""Ma'am." The reply came. "Well let's see, the girl's barely conscious, the ghoul's got her hips in his grip and is behind her, his huge cock keeps pounding into the girl's cunt. It looks like there is a gold chain around the base of the ghoul's cock.""Ok, stun them both, kill the Ghoul, and collect the girl's memory of how this started. Team?""Yes, ready, check.""I've got love potions labeled Potter, Granger, Spinnett, Bell, Johnson, and even one for Arthur here. Stun and arrest everyone. What's this one? Hmmm also for Bell." Valarie said and added them to their evidence bags for later investigation.Molly's juice erupted all over Penny's face, causing the younger witch to jerk back, clenching her ass, Percy came inside her in a massive torrent that left him in agony from his abused balls. The stunners hit them a moment later."Excuse me Miss Hit Witch?" Luna called from the back door of the Burrow."Girl, why are you naked?" Valerie said, turning her attention to the young girl."I've been chased all over the place by Ronald Weasley, he's been trying to rape me.""Where is he?" she spat, stepping onto the porch."Right on the steps, he's too tired to walk.""Got him." She said as the stunner impacted the young idiot."Thank you Miss Hit Witch." Luna said and gave the robed woman a gentle hug of thanks."Team, the youngest male was chasing a girl around outside, someone come collect him from the steps. Kestes and Holmes, escort papa Weasley to a holding cell for questioning. Don't make his arrest public, he might not have a clue what's going on here."}-{Daphne found her Aunt talking to Mrs. Tonks in the sitting room. There was no sign of Remus, Hermione, Ginny or Nym. A quick check of the wards told her that Ginny and Hermione were talking in Ginny's room and the others were no longer in the house. Lord Black continued to sleep in his suite."So what's the diagnosis?" she asked as they paused their conversation."It's not good." Mrs. Tonks said, turning to her. "He needs a mind healer, and I'm not that. Had it been a curse, well if wishes were fishes and all that. His magic is in fair shape, physically his body seems to have recovered well from his ordeal.""So how do we help him?" Daphne asked."We need to get him to France." Mrs. Tonks said. "Or some country that won't throw him straight into prison, and get him to a competent healer.""Was he obliviated""Perhaps a dozen times, it gets murky in there and like I said it's not my specialty."Daphne got the impression the woman had decided to spend more of her time riding Remus instead of doing a proper investigation, but it really didn't matter. They needed a mind healer and they couldn't trust any of them in this country."House Black thanks you Madam Tonks. Is there any reason to keep him unconscious?""No, though he may experience further pain as his mind tries to sort out what is real. He shouldn't be a danger to anyone else. I did see some fairly deviant sexual behavior, but I don't know if it really happened or was part of an obliviation or merely a dream."Daphne escorted the older woman from the house, while her aunt shadowed them. Once they were alone in the parlor she let her emotions show. "Aunt M, do you have any contacts in France?""Not really." She said and hugged her niece. "I can go through official channels, but those would see him back in prison.""We need a way to get off of the British Isle." Daphne said."Lady Black?" Walburga's portrait called to get their attention."Yes?""The Black family has permanent portkeys to each of their properties. They are stored in the Lord's study. There should still be a villa on the French Riviera, the mind healers in France should be able to help my son.""That is truly helpful Madam Black." Marlene said and gave the surprised portrait a curtsy.

Chapter 17Harry was really glad he'd had that conversation with himself. He was an alright bloke, just needed to learn to communicate better. And that was the first order of business, communicate to his girls how he felt and what that meant.He found Hermione on the fourth floor landing, just coming out of Ginny's room."Hey." He said and pulled her into a hug before giving her a gentle kiss. When they parted, a bit breathless, he noticed a lack of Ginny. "How's our ward?""Um." She said still a bit dazed from his kisses which made that second Harry in his head do a weird dance and then resolve to learn how to actually dance, that stuff from the Yule Ball didn't count."Are you ok?" he said kindly, putting his arm around her waist to guide her down the stairs. "Have you recovered from all of no-name's knowledge?""No." She said and slowly shook her head. "I've been running on just two of me, not sorting that stuff out until tomorrow. Some of it's going to be horrendous.""Yeah, I can imagine." He said, helping her down the stairs, though she seemed to have recovered he still thought it would be a good idea."I got his knowledge of Occlumency that was weird, meeting myself for the first time. I think all of you are on the safe list now, some of his defenses are really nasty.""Oh, good. Are you sure it was you that you met?""Yeah, can't really be anyone else in my head can it?"She bit her lower lip and looked at him, pausing on the second floor landing. "Well if you're sure.""Yeah." He said and gave her a quick kiss and a grin. "Hey girls, wait there." He called when he heard Daphne from the first floor."Girls?" Marlene said with a raised eyebrow when he and Hermione had joined them in the parlor."Yes." He said firmly. "Hermione, Daphne, do you have any objection to Marlene joining us?""No." Daphne said immediately while Hermione looked shocked, which was shared by the object of his discussion."Are you sure?" Marlene said softly, her eyes troubled."Very." He said and turned to his first friend. "I know you have objections, but are not against the idea. Talk to me.""It's too soon." She said, her hand trembling where it touched his wrist. "I need to sit." She muttered and took a half-step before Harry picked her up and carried her to the couch.He sat, cradling his most precious in his lap and then wondered where he'd found that name.Work on better pet names!On it."Hermione?" he said gently and brushed his fingers through her hair."I'm here love." She said looking up at him and then twisting to look at Marlene and Daphne who both stood a few feet away looking apprehensive. "Come here you two."She motioned with her free hand and caught Daphne's as she got close."I'm just a bit shocked. Yes, I agree she is one of us. I was concerned that she'd get in trouble more than anything. I think we need to wait until Harry's recognized as an adult." She said and got her other hand free from her lap to take Marlene's hand as well. "I've only ever felt connected to Harry and Daph, but all of our magic seems to want to be together.""Mine certainly does." Harry said. "Wait that doesn't work to well does it. I mean that my magic wants the three of you and damn anyone who says otherwise."Marlene laughed at his confusion. "So what is my nickname?""Lene." He answered immediately. "At least that's the one I came up with earlier when I realized I couldn't stand the thought of you with another man.""Well I'll answer to it at least." Marlene said with a soft pout. "Now are you sure you're willing to be associated with an older woman?""Yes, in fact I am more comfortable knowing that all three of you are older than I am. I'm certain it won't be an issue in a few decades.""Well as I've said, I'm willing to try. Once the courts recognize you're an adult, I'll have to give you a consort ring, I can't be yours.""Oh." Harry said."Since McKinnon is the same rank as Potter, she's got to maintain her family name that means you're her consort." Daphne said as though he should have understood that to begin with."That makes my head hurt." He said with a crooked smile, then shifted Hermione to sit beside him on the couch so he could stand and pull Marlene into his arms."Oh." She said, looking into his emerald green eyes."I really need to get taller." He laughed and then pulled her down so he could kiss her gently on her red-painted lips."Well if she wore shorter heels you'd at least come up to her nose." Daphne said."We can get him heels to wear?" Hermione giggled at the thought, causing the two who were kissing to laugh and look at her. "Oh, kiss her better than that." She admonished.Harry wagged a finger at Hermione, but then thought better of it and turned back to Marlene who was smiling gently down at him. Far more seriously than a minute ago he pulled her down for a kiss. This one was more involved and his magic surged around the room causing all three girls to squeak.Hermione and Daphne joined in the hug and the four of them stood there for a few minutes until Harry and Marlene finally parted."Thank you." Harry said to her and then captured her lips for a short kiss, when he pulled away from Marlene he kissed his other ladies briefly and sighed contentedly. "One more thing." He said looking into Hermione's eyes. "No more.""Yes, Harry." The brilliant brunette said and looked down at her hands. "I'm sorry if I've pushed you."He laughed and tweaked her nose gently. "No you're not. This is precisely what you've wanted.""Can we sit?" Hermione said and promptly did so. "I'd like to go over how all this happened once, to clear the air at least among us as to what happened when.""If you feel the need to justify yourself." Harry said playfully to his witch, while Hermione patted his knee."Back in our third year, Harry and I had a falling out over a broom he received as a gift. I went behind his back to McGonagall, which I now admit was wrong of me. But while we were not talking Daphne and I formed a relationship."Daphne shrugged, "We were a pair of thirteen year old precocious girls with a time turner. What did you expect? I regret nothing." She said making Harry laugh but raise his eyebrow."Towards the end of the year, Harry and I made up and became friends again, but I was terrified to tell him about Daphne. We were in different houses and then there's the whole stigma of being a witches witch.""And then in fourth year Harry's name came out of the Goblet." Daphne said. "And everyone abandoned him, except Mine.""We spent almost all of our spare time together trying to get him ready for the tasks.""And then after the first task, we had sex." Harry said."It was fairly spontaneous." Hermione said, blushing and looking at the table."She told me about it the next day." Daphne said. "And we couldn't decide what to do about us. She and I had continued to meet one another occasionally in fourth year, just wasn't very often with the tournament."Hermione shrugged. "Anyway we got through the year and I asked the Headmaster for help. Then all of this happened.""So I at least now have the whole timeline." Marlene said, "not sure if we really needed that, but thanks.""Did anyone fill Lene in on what happened in my head?" Harry asked."No," Hermione said while Daphne shook her head."What happened?""When I picked up that locket thing, it attacked me. I had a fight in my head with no-nose and he was winning before the ladies here came in. Just where did the Sword of Gryffindor come from?" he suddenly asked."I wished for it, thinking I would just get what your magic thought of as it. But since I was able to bring it out here it's got to be the real one." Hermione said."So we were wrestling it, Daphne stabbed it with her goblin blade but it didn't seem to care, then Hermione put Godric's sword in his head and that did him in." Harry said."Then the whole construct dissolved into black mist which contained his, Voldemort's, memories." Hermione said."And then she got drunk on them." Daphne added with a laugh causing their brunette companion to blush and look down."I don't think anyone here is shocked that Hermione Granger gets drunk on knowledge." Harry said. "Now so far I've realized I learned Occlumency from that, and I feel a lot more confident than I used to.""Do you want me to test you?" Daphne asked."Not just yet." He said quickly. "I've tried to make it safe for the three of you, but I'm not positive I've done it right. Some of these defenses look downright vicious.""So that covers what went on in your head, but we've had two more conversations you need to know about." Marlene said."First Ginny gave her evidence, with Hermione and Nym there. It basically condemned all of the younger Weasleys and their mum, I sent Nym with the evidence to one of my Hit Witch co-workers to arrest them immediately.""Won't that have an effect on Harry's trial?" Daphne asked."What?" Harry asked."One of Dumbledore's prominent allies, Arthur, will be implicated. It can't help you during your trial." Daphne clarified."Hmm." Marlene said, "It really depends on how soon that trial is, compared to when the news breaks on this.""And there's no word on when the trial will be yet." Hermione said with a shrug."Well since our defense is basically that I was already an adult it should be a moot point." Harry said. "So what else happened?""Mrs. Tonks came and checked out Sirius." Marlene said. "We found out from Ginny that he was obliviated, but Mrs. Tonks believes it was quite a few times.""He needs a mind healer, in France." Daphne added."How are we going to get him there?" Hermione asked."Madam Black told us about permanent portkeys that should be in the Lord's study." Marlene said. "One of them goes to a villa in France.""Cool." He said. "How's Ginny taking all this?""Very well I believe. She realizes that the morals her mum taught her are not socially acceptable, which is why she first told us something was wrong. I was just helping her sort out her room." Hermione said. "She was going to spend some time looking through her new wardrobe. There were a lot of things that we bought that she hardly saw."Harry snapped his fingers and pointed at Marlene. "Daph where did that stuff go we bought Lene?""You bought me something?""Yep." Harry said."In with my stuff." Daphne said and turned to her aunt after a nod from Harry. "We got you a nice dress and a pair of boots. You'll love them."Marlene broke into a broad smile and then laughed warmly for a moment. "Thank you, I'm sure I will."}-{The front door clicked open, quickly followed by Remus Lupin, "Hello in the house?" he said and then noticed them sitting in the parlor."Remus." Harry said happily. "Where have you been?""I went out to get some lunch. Didn't want to impose." The ragged man said making all of them frown."Remus Lupin." Daphne said, standing and walking quickly over to the suddenly worried man. She took his hands and looked up into his grey eyes. "As I am the Lady of this house, don't you dare insult me like that ever again. You've proven your loyalty to Sirius and Harry, therefore you will be treated as a welcome guest.""Um." Remus said, looking over Daphne's blonde tresses to Harry."Don't look at me for help." Harry said with a laugh. "You brought that on yourself. For what it's worth I heartily agree with my lady.""I'm not joking with you Mr. Lupin," Daphne said pulling his attention back to her. "The honor of House Black is a tender thing. I am insulted by your actions. My elf provided us all with a nice lunch. I'm sure there would have been a place for you had you stayed instead of sneaking out the door after helping Mrs. Tonks.""I didn't want your charity." He said tears dripping down his cheeks."No," She said, shaking her long hair. "House Black doesn't ever give out charity. We pay our debts.""I've got an idea." Harry said, coming over to the doorway and taking Daphne's hands from where she still gripped Lupin's. "Mrs. Tonks recommends Sirius go to France to see a mind healer. I'm hiring you to take him, via permanent Black family portkey, to the villa on the French Riviera and see to that.""Um…""I recommend you take my husband's offer." Daphne said, sliding into Harry's arms."Well ok." Remus said after another minute's thought."Great." Harry said and clapped the werewolf on the shoulder with his free hand. "Now if you don't have a room here yet, go find one and move in. Only Sirius and Ginny Weasley are in the house in addition to us. You know where my Godfather is, Ginny's been moved to the other suite on the fourth floor.""Well ok." Remus said. "When do you think we should head to France?""After Sirius wakes up and we can verify the existence of this portkey." Marlene said from the couch. "We'll also need to give you both some money until Sirius can contact Gringotts bank in Paris.""Yeah, that makes sense I guess." Remus said looking up the stairs. "I'll just be in my room then.""You come down for dinner when called!" Daphne said firmly."Yes," Remus said then suddenly grinned and looked at Harry. "She's a lot like Lily." He cuffed the stunned Harry on the shoulder and headed up the stairs two at a time.Harry looked at Marlene who shrugged. "I started Hogwarts their last year, but no one questioned the Head Girl, that's for sure.""Come back to the couch." Hermione called, pulling their attention back to the room. "It's far more comfortable to sit and talk here."Yes, and some tea." Daphne said causing Kreature to appear. "I believe we're all still full from your excellent lunch, just some tea to sip while we talk.""Yes, Madam Black." The elf said with a deep bow and popped away."So what did you want to talk about?" Harry asked once they were all sitting down."Tell them about the Dursleys." Hermione said gently. "Or I can if you wish."Harry shivered and clenched his hands together briefly. "Why?" he asked, keeping his head down and his voice controlled."They deserve to know." Hermione said and put her hand on his thigh."Yeah, you're right." He said, "But I hate this topic.""What?" Marlene asked."My relatives hate me and anything to do with magic." Harry said, slowly looking up, but not meeting their eyes. "They called me Freak and boy, I didn't know my name until the first day of school and the teacher got mad at me for not answering when she called it. I couldn't do well in school because my cousin is dumber than Ron, and I got in trouble for looking better than him."The room was fairly silent as Kreature appeared with the tea service and poured each of them a cup and vanished."So I know some of what Daph went through, except my guardians didn't heal me. My own magic did what it could, or I probably would have died while I was growing up.""Is that why you're so short?" Marlene asked.Harry shrugged while Hermione made a sharp hissing noise."What I mean is, that if your magic was busy repairing you, it couldn't put that energy into growing you taller and stronger.""Nutrient potions." Daphne said. "My healer made me take a lot of them after I got away from my parents.""Well they wouldn't hurt him to take." Marlene said. "Daphne dear, send your elf for a month's supply from the Apothecary in Wales, not that cheap one in Diagon."Daphne looked Harry in the eye and when he nodded she called for Kreature and sent him to purchase the potions."Whether or not that helps, we should have Mrs. Tonks look at you too." Hermione said.}-{"Hello Arthur.""Amy? Oh, my thank you. I've been left alone here for hours!"Amelia Bones sat in one of the two chairs and observed the frantic father. "Sit, we've got a lot to discuss."Arthur quickly did so and tried not to ask what was going on."One of my Hit Witches interviewed your daughter earlier today.""Is Ginny alright?" he asked, jumping to his feet."SIT!" Amelia barked and he collapsed back into the chair. "She told of some very disturbing things going on under your nose at your home. First and foremost is Molly's frequent use of both Obliviations and Love/Lust potions.""No, oh Merlin no." he said, trembling in fright.Amelia nodded. "You should be starting to feel withdrawal about now. You've been dosed for over two decades. There were some very disturbing things going on at your house today when my Aurors arrived. I will not go into the disgusting details at this time, but I have three girls in St. Mungo's who are going to take months to recover from the potions in their systems, another who was chased all over by your youngest son and narrowly avoided being raped. And I'm still not sure what was going on with Penelope and Percy, though neither of them were under the influence of potions.""Oh my. Why?"Amelia shrugged, "Sometimes the answers make less sense than the crimes. I do have an arrest warrant out for your older sons as well. We're especially interested in William's new Veela girlfriend and whether or not she's been dosed with potions as well.""What can I do to help?" Arthur said, his hands clenched tightly together, though both were shaking fairly hard at the thoughts going through his mind."Well first you're going to visit St. Mungo's under guard to have a full workup done on you and what's in your system. You will not see any of your family or the girls involved at this time.""Is Ginny ok?" Arthur said after a violent nod of his head.Amelia looked into his eyes for a full minute before she answered. "In case you were not told this by Molly. She is a Ward of House Potter. Mr. Potter claimed his title, Miss Granger is the Lady Designate for House Potter. Ginevra was taken on a shopping trip in Diagon, supervised by a Hit Witch, who informed me that your daughter is safe."Arthur started crying into his hands, rocking slowly sideways on the chair.Amelia stood and hesitated a moment before patting his shoulder and walking from the room.

Chapter 18"Would any of you mind a shopping trip to a muggle jeweler?" Hermione asked."What have you just thought of?" Daphne asked, pressing her nose lightly against Hermione's who merely grinned and pressed a gentle kiss to her lover's pouting lips."I have no objection." Marlene said and looked at her robe. "Though a change of attire is required prior to such a jaunt."Harry shrugged. "Sure, lets.""But we need to be back for dinner." Daphne said, her eyes still intently looking into Hermione's who easily bore the attention without cracking her resolve."So we'll all change and meet back here in twenty minutes?" Marlene asked."Make it thirty." Harry said, "and I'm going to invite Gin."Hermione took a step back from Daphne and grinned. "Thank you." She virtually sang and headed up the stairs two at a time.Harry and Daphne shared a look, he then shrugged and she slowly shook her head. Neither of them had been able to guess what the brilliant one was up to, but they were willing to go along with it regardless."Kreacher?" Daphne called as Harry and Marlene headed up the stairs."Mistress?" he said after popping in a few feet in front of her."We are going out. Should Lord Black awake, feed him and tell him to rest. We will be back in time for dinner.""Yes, Mistress." The elf said with a deep bow before popping away.Ginny was the most nervous of the group, but Marlene took her hand and the young girl calmed dramatically. Cars and huge red buses were not that bad with a Hit Witch beside her. She actually started to enjoy the scenery and the fact she had nice, new, clothes on too.Marlene McKinnon was a noble lady, and it showed in her bearing and attire. She wore an Alexander McQueen white sundress that displayed most of her long legs. Men went out of their way to open doors for her. One even stepped into traffic to force them to stop so she and her party could cross.Harry scowled at them, but Marlene just laughed it off.Daphne, though only fifteen, looked considerably older in her red sundress and heeled sandals. She walked tightly against Harry's side, not comfortable or familiar with their current location.Hermione led the way, first having Marlene apparate them all to Kings Cross Station and then a fairly short walk to Hirschfelds on Hatton Gardens. The jewelers was ancient by muggle standards, but was still not as old as Albus Dumbledore having been established when he was a boy of thirteen.The young lady pulled the door open and hurried inside without a moment's hesitation. She quickly found one of the sales associates and inquired about custom jewelry. Two minutes later she was sitting at the counter in conversation with one of the jewelers who began sketching a design on a piece of graph paper. The others wandered the store, inspecting the many displays. Marlene kept a light hold of the ginger's hand while they discussed what they were looking at.Harry stood a bit apart with Daphne at his shoulder. She was listening in on Hermione's discussion, while he merely waited for his first true friend to divulge her idea."Harry, come here." She called and the boy obliged. She held up his fringe, displaying his famous scar to the man."Just like that?" he asked."Yes, I'm thinking 3-4 centimeters in total length." She said letting Harry's fringe go and allowing him to sit beside her."And the metal?""18 karat Gold, Silver and Platinum, make the gold ones the longest and the Platinum ones the smallest.""What are you up to?" Harry asked."Earrings." Daphne said, her hands resting lightly on his shoulders causing Hermione to smile broadly and turn back to the jeweler."Let me check on some prices for you and I'll be back." He said and headed into the back area."So each of us will have Harry's famous lightning-bolt dangling from our ears?" Daphne asked.Hermione nodded, still smiling happily at her idea."Get Marlene a set as well." Harry said."If it's going to be our symbol then your Ward should have something similar." Daphne said. "How about a pendant on a necklace?""Sure." Harry said and motioned for Marlene to join them."What are we here for?" she asked softly so as not to disturb the other customers."Harry Potter Lightning-Bolt earrings." Daphne said in reply."Oh." Marlene said and then slowly smiled. "I'll take a pair too.""What?" Ginny asked."Would you like a necklace with a gold lightning-bolt on it?" Hermione asked her.Ginny shrugged, "Sure, I've never had any real jewelry. This stuff looks amazing."Harry shared a pointed look with Hermione before turning back to his Ward. "Pick out a bracelet or something else you like Gin."Her bright brown eyes went wide, "Are you sure?""Yes." He said and she allowed Marlene to pull her back to one of the displays they had looked at earlier."You'll make a good father." Daphne said and kissed the stunned boy's cheek. She too then wandered along the display case, a red tipped finger trailing just over the glass surface.In the end Marlene had to pay the bill, she had a credit card. She laughed it off when Harry complained, he needed to come prepared for these things she said. The custom jewelry would be ready in a few weeks, certainly before September first.Ginny had picked out a gold charm-bracelet and three charms to go on it, a castle, a dragon, and a crystal unicorn with a gold plated horn. Hermione had also convinced her to pick out three pairs of earrings, though her ears were not yet pierced, Marlene promised to take care of that when they were back at Black Manor.Daphne purchased an anklet with an inch long Egyptian Ankh dangling from it.}-{"Miss Clearwater?" The Auror asked as she came into the holding cell. The girl looked a bit bedraggled, but the medi-witches had cleaned her up and dressed her in a simple grey robe."Where's Percy?" the former Head Girl asked immediately, not acknowledging the question.The woman's eyebrow rose and she said. "I'm Auror Angela Michaels. I believe your name is Penelope Clearwater. Is that correct?""Yes." Penelope said irritably, "I want to know where my fiancée is and why the hell we're not together.""Well, I'm afraid I cannot divulge that information at this time. I'm here to question you about a few things." Auror Michaels said and waited for the girl to calm down."I know as a half-blood, I don't have many rights. But I do know you cannot keep us apart. Percy will speak for me, I'm under his protection." Penelope said holding up her engagement ring."I'll be back.""Remember you have two hours to inform the Minister of Percy's arrest, he is a member of his staff. I hope you're following the law!"The Auror slipped from the room without answering that question. She hoped her bosses had done what they were supposed to do. Right now she had to go find out. She wasn't taking the fall for them!}-{Captain Shacklebolt, damn that sounded good. The newly minted Auror Captain checked on the rest of his team. They were dressed as civilians for this mission, apprehend the oldest Weasley boy, and the French cunt with him.The boy was a curse breaker for the dirty thieving goblins, and considered a very dangerous man. The French cunt was an animal, to be put down before she seduced the whole family of purebloods.Their targets strode out of the bank just before closing. The French chit waving her ass as the stunned boy followed her as fast as he could without running.He signaled his men, they had to get out of sight of the goblin guards or there would be an incident over this.Kingsley lined his shot up, he'd take out the boy before he could do anything, the other members of his team were going after the cunt.BAM, Kingsley said in his head as his bludgeoning hex knocked the boy forward onto his face. Perfect hit, on the back of the head.}-{"The apparition point is at the ozzer end of the alley." Fleur said, not looking back at Bill. They were about a hundred feet from it when she sensed an attack.Her wand flashed into her hand and she danced to the side as spells converged on her former position and on William who crumpled to the ground instantly.Fleur's wand blurred as she immobilized two of their attackers with a simple flying chain that shoved them against the wall and pinned them there, breaking one man's arm and choking the other. Then she was moving once again as two more spells converged on her former position.She caught another man, who had just missed her with a bone-breaker, with a hex that removed his wand-hand."Hold!" Barked the last attacker. "Miss, stop, we're Aurors." He said and held his wand defensively."Zee French Aurors do not attack innocents through ambush!" she spat, a shimmering shield materializing around her."We thought you were under duress.""Bah." She scoffed. "I am Veela!""Miss, I'm sorry." The tall black man said, holding up his badge."Bon, why are you attacking moi?""Our orders were to bring you both in for questioning." He said."Why?" she said, slowly.He sighed, looked around at the gathering crowd and then back to the angry witch. "There was a raid at his home earlier today, certain things were discovered that led us to believe you might also be a victim.""I am Veela Monsieur Auror, my will is far stronger than mere potions."The Aurors breath hitched. "Can we take this conversation to headquarters?""You may take William and your injured. That man is looking blue." Fleur said in clearer English now that she was calming down.Kingsley quickly moved to dispel her conjured chain, but it flickered and remained.She cast a spell and it vanished causing both men to collapse to the ground, one gasping for breath and the other cradling his shattered arm."Johnson and Conners, take the Weasley boy and Koop to St. Mungo's immediately. Keep the boy under guard." Kingsley ordered and the two Aurors moved quickly. One summoning Koop's severed hand just before they portkeyed away.Moments later she was alone with the tall black Auror who had yet to introduce himself."Your name?" she asked."Auror Captain Kingsley Shacklebolt." He said it rather bitterly she thought.She finally allowed her shield to vanish and stepped forward. Her sudden motion caused the Auror to flinch back. "Do you have a Portkey to your Ministry?" she asked, her wand still at the ready."Yes." He said, pulling a crumpled quill from his inner pocket and holding it out to her. When she took it he tapped it with his wand and they vanished.Fleur landed like a cat, the Auror stumbled into a wall but remained on his feet. When he looked at her again she had a badge in his face. "I work for my Fazzer, you will remember he is the Chief of our Intelligence."Kingsley gulped, this had not gone how he'd expected at all. Fortunately he was rescued by the arrival of his boss."Auror, why are you incapable of discretion?" Amelia Bones spat at him and then waved him away before he could answer.Merlin she hadn't used his new title. Kingsley slunk away to report to Dumbledore."Miss Delacour, please come to my office, so we can speak privately.""Oui." Fleur said, her wand flashed a spell over her to fix her appearance, before vanishing into her holster as she strode along the marble hallway beside the Head of the English Law.Once they were alone Amelia shook her head. "I'm sorry Miss. I should have sent less violent Aurors, or a lone Hit Wizard. I take it you are not under the influence of love potions created by Molly Weasley?""Non, though they are likely in my system if you test for them." Fleur said and sat casually in one of the guest chairs. "William gave me a piece of chocolate cake he said his mozzer had baked for me. I ate it and could immediately tell it was laced with a love potion. Fortunately it was one that does not work on Veela. When I told William he grew angry and asked me to accompany him to his parent's ome to confront her for interfering in his life.""Are you and Mr. Weasley involved?""Non," Fleur said shaking her head. "We are boze under contract wiz Gringotts. E is training me in ward construction and zeir breaking. Zee Goblins required us to accept a charm to prevent, as you say, us becoming involved." She shoved her hair back over her left ear, revealing a small fang dangling from her lobe."So what does that do?""If eizer of us feel lust toward another wearing the charm we will feel equally sick to our stomachs. Trust me et is sufficient a deterrent.""Well we raided their house this morning. I'm glad to discover you are not another victim." Amelia said."I have always had to protect myself from lecherous men. The only man under a hundred I have met who can truly resist my allure is your National Hero, Monsieur Potter, though we came to more pleasant accommodations after the Tournament was settled.""Wait, I read he is involved with two ozzer." Amelia broke off her sentence and shook her head. "Sorry, two other girls, Miss Granger and Miss Greengrass.""Oui, 'ermione is a wonderfully talented witch." Fleur said with a gentle sigh. "But that is not your concern. How can I assist in this investigation?"Amelia shook her head, "I don't believe you can. We have our evidence for the other crimes. Oh, I would like to get that sample of your blood showing the potions in your system.""Certainement." Fleur said. "And zen I must inform Gringotts of William's condition, once I learn it of course."}-{The healer at St. Mungo's shook his head, looking at the damage caused by the spell to the back of the man's head. He'd need a mental healer as well. The poor man had certainly suffered brain damage."Get McFarra, he works for Gringotts, bound to have all kinds of protections in there." Healer Jameson called to one of the nurses who hurried away.The broken nose and abraded skin on his face was easily repaired as was the cracked skull. The mind healer arrived a few minutes after the other injuries were healed."What we got?" Grace McFarra asked as she waddled into the room. The woman was nine months pregnant and promptly sat in one of the chairs."Gringotts employee, got hit in the back of the head with a bludgeoner." Healer Jameson said and handed her the chart."Hmm." She said flipping to the second page where the information she was interested in was recorded. "Curse breaker? Core." She said shaking her head. "Ok, give me a few and I'll go see what's left of the poor sod's grey matter.""What do you mean?" one of the Auror guards asked.But the mind healer was already in a trance so Healer Jameson answered. "Shocks to the head can destroy the brain inside. We have no spells or potions to make it work again, it's one of the great mysteries of healing, how does our brain actually work?""Oh." The guard said and went back outside to mutter with the other one."Alright Jimmy, I'm ready." Grace said.Healer Jameson propped open the man's bloodshot eyes and she slipped inside.There were very few mental healers to begin with, and only two of them were under Gringott's seal. The oaths designed to prevent bank secrets from being removed from their employees were extensive and could attack her, but she had the counters in her mind, ready to disarm them if needed.Lots of sealed chambers, each under the G symbol, they looked undamaged so she pushed ahead. Deeper and farther back in his past.Oh, what's that? She thought as she came across a blackened area. That was a poorly done obliviation. No Ministry or Gringotts seal, so it wasn't a legitimate one. She delved into it and quickly reconstructed the thoughts.Grace clutched her distended belly in horror. Damn. It was a brief conversation with his mum, from quite a while ago."Hey mum, how's Ginny doing?" William said walking into his parents room. He looked to be in his final years of school, if not just graduated.Ginny was a recently born baby, suckling at her mother's breast while the other one hung in the open waiting for her."Your daughter's doing wonderful son." Molly said with a happy smile."That's great. I'm glad I could help mum."Yeowch, that was sick. She thought and moved on. That hadn't been caused by the spell to his head, someone had removed the memory. Well it was restored now. She shrugged and delved into another obliviated spot."Oh, William you're cocks so much bigger than your father's. That's it. I love teenaged stamina!"YIKES. Grace thought and damn near obliviated that memory herself. Then she doubled over in pain and was suddenly back in her own body. "Ohh." She said as her water broke and drenched the chair."Gotcha." Healer Jameson said and levitated her into the next room and signaling for a maternity crew."Jimmy!" Grace said between contractions, taking Healer Jameson's hand. "That man's mum seduced him and had his baby, a girl!" she said between clenched teeth and then had to close her eyes as more pain shot through her."Wow." He said. "What about the spell damage?"Grace shook her head, "Didn't get to it.""Ok, I'll take care of it. Congratulations Gracie." He said and left the soon to be mother as the maternity healer and her crew rushed into the chamber.}-{"I'm back!" Albus Dumbledore announced as he arrived in the parlor of number 12 Grimmauld Place in a ball of fire. His clothing had changed into that typically worn by British explorers of bygone centuries. Pith hat and pipe with khaki pants, dragonhide boots, and a crisp white shirt."Hmm." He said looking around the room and puffing gently on the pipe. "No one present." He clenched the pipe in his teeth and used his wand to conjure a note to Mr. Potter. He wasn't about to go exploring the upper floors of the house. Searching through Ministry archives was one thing, possibly interrupting coitus, a spine shivering other thing all together.Now he was off to locate that ham and cheese sandwich one of the elves had brought him an hour or so ago. And then perhaps a nice nap before dinner, yes that sounded like a wonderful end to a day on the African Savannah.With a fiery implosion Fawkes took his crazy master off on another 'great adventure.'}-{Madam Umbridge strode out of the holding cells with Percy and his fiancée right behind her. How dare they arrest her secretary! She had to speak to Cornelius immediately about these damned Aurors. They were going to disrupt the plan!Once they were in her office, and she was comfortably surrounded by her kittens, she breathed a sigh of relief. This young man was far too valuable to her. Why he'd already made her a fortune on a simple regulation for the thickness of potion cauldrons! And according to him the actual calculations, that the potions masters couldn't dispute, had come from this half-blood with him. Well exceptions would be made where useful people were found."Mr. Weasley, please take tomorrow off to recover and calm your betrothed. I shall speak to the Minister and we will get back to business on Wednesday." She said in her sweet and warm voice."But what about our arrest?" He asked.She waved her hand dismissively. "I spoke to Madam Bones myself. She said that neither of you were involved in anything illegal. Her people were apparently over-eager to arrest everyone in the house. No charges were, or will be, filed.""Thank you Madam Undersecretary." Percy said and bowed while Penelope remained silent as a good pure-blood wife should and curtsied along with his bow."The remainder of your biological family appears to be destined for Azkaban. It is a good thing you have publically distanced yourself." She continued in her warm, sweet voice. Trying to reassure them of her good will. "Now we just need an unbeatable strategy to bury Mr. Potter at his trial. Your thoughts, both of you, would be appreciated on the matter.""Yes, Madam Undersecretary, we'll discuss it.""No, no dear boy. Rest and recoup, there is plenty of time, the trial date isn't set yet.""Thank you." Percy said and they gratefully headed home.}-{Marlene was the first one into the house and immediately noticed the floating letter in the middle of the parlor. She directed Harry in that general direction and drew her wand to check for anything dangerous about it. "It's from Dumbledore." She said a moment later as Daphne closed the door.Harry nodded and opened the scroll, with Hermione over his shoulder they read the missive. "He found the proof of my emancipation.""I knew it was there!" Hermione said and gave him a quick kiss."What's going on?" Sirius said from the landing above them. "The wards are gone?""I have them Lord Black." Daphne said. "I'm not entirely certain as to why, but rest assured I have them under control.""Oh good." He said and finished descending the stairs. "I had a bizarre dream, I couldn't move, it was like one of those alien abductions. Though I don't think I'm pregnant.""What are you talking about Sirius?" Harry asked in concern."I dreamt Remus was having sex with Bella in my bedroom." He said and then did a full body shiver. "I really need to find a mind healer, this is ridiculous. Why couldn't it have been me with a nubile teen?""Sirius Black!" Marlene said sharply, reading his surface thoughts. She conjured a blow up sex doll in front of him."Hey!" He said while Remus descended the stairs and wolf-whistled. Whether it was for Marlene's dress or the doll it was misconstrued by the angry witch.She then transfigured it into a female black lab. "Oh, sorry, is that more your preference? A fuck-bitch?" She was quite angry at their obvious lust."I've had sex with a lot of dogs, what's wrong with that?" Sirius said."Merlin," Marlene breathed out, staring at him in disgust. "You need to get out of England and find a good mental healer. Harry needs a stable father figure, not a wild gigolo who thinks with his dick.""What's wrong with that?" Remus asks "I've done it with plenty of wolves."The look of disgust that all the women gave them seemed to finally make an impact on the two men."Lord Black, you will hand over your portkey to the island to your Heir. Then you and your fellow disgusting male, will take the portkey to the Black estate in France, which has no extradition law with England and has decent laws concerning Weres. There you will both seek mental help. You will not return to this country until they deem you healthy enough to interact with children!" Marlene said stiffly, her anger barely held in check."So you're just going to take my godson and his women off to a tropical island for a week? You're twice his age, how is that in anyway better than what we've done?""I am human!" She spat at them and turned to leave."No, you're some species of Ice Bitch. Now I see where your niece got it from." Sirius yelled back.Marlene stiffened and spun, wand coming up. There was no way they could fight her so Harry did the only thing he could think of to stop her from killing the two men, he kissed her – hard. When they parted a moment later he spoke in a harsh whisper. "Not worth it Lene.""Harry!" She said, eyes wide."What?" He said, rather a bit in shock at his own actions.Marlene was then turned around by Consort Potter and rendered speechless by a searing kiss that left both of them a bit dazed.Hermione managed to smirk, "Definitely human, and as delicious as my Daph.""Upstairs ladies, I'll join you when I settle this." Harry said, his voice had started gentle, but turned firm as he looked at his godfather and adoptive uncle.When the men were alone in the parlor Harry sighed. "I'm not going to try to judge you, and I expect the same from you." He said and righted a chair that he didn't remember knocking over."Well." Sirius said, looking down at his feet."Sure." Remus said and sat in a chair."Look, I don't quite understand what's been going on between myself and Marlene except that our magic has been pulling us together since we met on my birthday. My morals are a bit screwed up, having grown up with the Dursleys, so I've tried to just keep my witch happy. So long as she is ok with this, I will be too." Harry poured himself a glass of hot tea from the pot that had appeared on the table."Yeah." Remus said, filling his own glass and cradling it in both of his hands."I'm sorry if I've disappointed you Harry." Sirius said."I think you should do what Marlene said. It might do you more good in the long run." Harry said sipping his tea carefully. "You've both been through a lot, twelve years in prison has to leave some issues Sirius.""Yes, it has." His godfather said. "It's why I can't stop drinking.""I'm sure there are mind healers that can help you overcome those memories and restore the ones taken from you." Harry said."France has a strong magical, and medical community." Remus said. "Well, I'll go pack. We'll catch up with you when we're back pup. Hopefully before school starts, but that's only a few weeks away.""Thank you uncle." Harry said patting his adoptive uncle's shoulder as the worn Marauder headed upstairs."I don't know what to do." Sirius said after a pause."I can't see how following her advice can be bad." Harry said. "You won't be arrested in France, and you can get better. You were obliviated by Mrs. Weasley. I need you able to help me, not sit around drunk arguing with your mother's portrait what insult you should be called."Sirius laughed, he didn't really remember what had happened, Fire whiskey did that to you, but it sounded funny. "Yes, though Mother does like your Slytherin girl.""So get packed up, put the portkey to the island on the table here, and I'll expect to spend Christmas with you guys somewhere." Harry said and hurried upstairs before he cried.

Chapter 19Harry scrambled up the stairs, using his hands to keep from falling over in his haste. His eyes were blurry with imminent tears. The door to his right was open when he reached the fourth floor, his magic pulled him in that direction so he rushed into the room, hitting his shoulder on the doorjamb as he did.He passed Marlene and Ginny, sitting in chairs facing one another, tossed his glasses towards the head of the bed, and collapsed into Hermione's arms. Fortunately she had been sitting on the edge of the bed and had just risen, so he didn't hurt her in his haste.She immediately wrapped him into a hug, planting feather-kisses on his neck and jaw.}-{"What?" Ginny said, half-rising, but Marlene held her in the chair with a surprisingly strong arm.Daphne shared a brief glance at her aunt, flicked her wand at the door to close it, and then climbed on the bed behind her betrothed as his sobs made his body jerk at the force of them."It isn't our place." Marlene said softly to the confused ginger, using her own wand to cast a privacy spell over her bed. They could still see the three entwined, but no longer hear them."But aren't you going to be with him too? I've seen you kiss." she asked.Marlene blushed just a bit at that bald statement, but managed to nod. "I believe I shall, but he is their responsibility, allow them to help him work through his feelings.""But boys aren't supposed to cry!""Certainly they do." Marlene said gently. "Though he likely ran up here so as not to be seen by Sirius and Remus. It is considered unmanly, yet where did he go that he actually felt he could cry?" she said, using her wand to point at the bed."To Hermione." Ginny said and nodded with a sad frown. "She's always been whatever he needed. I used to be so jealous of her. I wanted to be her. If only I'd been a year older and a bunch smarter, but she was always there.""And she always will." Marlene said with certainty."What am I going to do?" Ginny asked.Marlene shrugged. "There are other good men out there, though sometimes they are hard to find. I was mostly unsuccessful myself, so I'm not the one to ask for advice." The elder witch said and then gestured for Ginny to sit properly in the chair and face her. "Now let us complete this. You want two on each side, right?""Yes, one on the lobe and one just here." Ginny said, pointing carefully at the spot she wanted the second piercing."Very well, the trick is to make the second ear match the first you know. So try to stay still. Yes this will hurt, but not for long.""OK, go ahead."Marlene performed the first piercing spell on Ginny's left earlobe."Yikes." Ginny said clenching her hands on her knees and flinching away from the pain."But it no longer hurts does it?" Marlene said gently, her hand on Ginny's shoulder.The younger girl reached up and touched her ear and then looked at the finger. "And no blood, just like you said." She took a deep breath and then nodded. "Continue please Ma'am.""Only if you never call me that again!" She said with a soft smile, "I'm Marlene.""Yes, Ma...rlene."The Hit Witch nodded in satisfaction and carefully pointed her wand before casting the second spell on the left ear. This time Ginny flinched but was far more controlled than the first time. She nodded a second later, her mouth clenched in concentration."Excellent." Marlene said and moved her wand to the other ear to repeat both spells.}-{"We're here love." Hermione whispered as Daphne spooned up behind him, her arm snaking under his head to support it."Why do they have to be such bastards?" he muttered into her shoulder."Honestly, I thought Marlene over-reacted a bit. She got too angry." Hermione said."We were told by Mrs. Tonks, that there were a lot of deviant thoughts or memories in Sirius' mind." Daphne added gently. "She didn't know if they were things that had actually happened or not.""And what if the black lab, he remembered was a witch animagus?" Hermione asked. "His memories are not where he expects them, both prison and obliviations have hurt him terribly.""So just forgive him?""No." both girls said gently before Hermione continued. "He needs to get help, then he can explain it.""He needs to explain it." Daphne said.Harry rolled onto his back slowly allowing Daphne time to move out of the way. She kept her arm under his head though. His hand covered his eyes, still leaking salty tears on the bedspread."And Remus needs to explain himself too." Daphne said. "I mean he could have meant he had sex with other werewolves during the night of the full moon, but that isn't what he said.""They are also both pranksters." Hermione added after a moment to think about it. "Perhaps they thought of it as a joke? I don't know."Harry shrugged, bumping his shoulder into Daphne's bicep and making her flinch in sudden pain, though she remained silent.Their brunette companion brushed her fingers gently over Daphne's cheek and mouthed a kiss in her direction. "I guess we'll learn at some point in the future. We really need Lord Black to be exonerated so he can speak for you in the Wizengamot.""I told them to leave." He said with a hitch in his voice. "Go to France and get healed. Maybe Sirius will also get exonerated. I really want more adult support. Can we trust the Headmaster or Madam Longbottom?""Dumbledore is still a puzzle to me." Daphne admitted. "I mean what's with those weird words every year? He says them sometimes when he's presiding over the Wizengamot.""I've spent hours pondering those strange words. The Prophet prints an annual issue with more than forty years of them. They call it the Dumbledore Linguistic Puzzle. Some speculate he's really revealing Merlin's lost knowledge!" Hermione said and then blushed as both Harry and Daphne had turned to look at her, mouths agape. "Sorry." She muttered."Don't ever change love." Daphne said, leaning over Harry."You think she's hot when she gets like that too?" Harry said, his former anguish pushed aside he turned to look into Daphne's eyes.The blonde witch licked her lips, her arm hugging him tightly. "Of course I do." She managed to say before her lips crashed down onto his."Hey I want some of that too." Hermione said with an overly-dramatic pout."Sorry." Harry said when Daphne pulled away."Yes." Their blonde companion added, licking her swollen red lips.Hermione lunged over him to meld her lips to Daphne's and the girls kissed frantically over his face.He found himself growing hard at the sight and then recalled just where they were and managed to calm himself. He had to control himself in front of Ginny. And that also went for his witches. With a gentle caress of their joined lips he got them apart."Not where my Ward can see us ladies." He said.That got everyone focused quickly, though Daphne did dip her lips down to catch his for the gentlest of kisses."We're here Harry, never forget that." She breathed just above his lips."Agreed love." Hermione said with a feather-light brush of her fingertips over his famous scar."OK, I think I'm recovered." He said as they both pulled back from him. "I just expected them to be more adult than me. Not that I've had much experience with stable adults who support me.""Just the one love." Hermione said, not bothering to point to the Hit Witch a few feet away who was now helping their Ward pick which earrings to wear in her newly pierced ears."Aunt M's got her own demons. Mostly related to her families legacy and everyone's expectations of her. But she's always tried to look out for me and Astoria.""Is your sister in danger?" Hermione asked. "From your father I mean."Daphne shook her head, looking through the spell keeping their words private. "No. He took it out on me because his first born wasn't male. She's always been his darling little girl.""But now she's got to carry on your family name." Harry said, slowly sitting up so they could sit in a loose triangle on the bed."Line Continuation." Daphne said with a shrug.Harry's eyes went wide and he quickly shook his head. "No.""I wasn't suggesting it." Daphne said, her sharp eyes boring into his, a nearly blank expression forming on her lovely face."Stop." Hermione said, giving Daphne's near shoulder a sharp poke to break her out of the moment. "He wasn't accusing you." She added when the tableau broke and the blonde sighed and looked at her hands in her lap."Sorry." She said a moment later when Harry reached over and took her hands in his."I might have said that a bit sharper than I should have." He said. "I apologize too. I just wanted to make it clear I'm not looking to expand what we have. Apparently my magic and Marlene's has something to say about that." He shrugged. "Regardless and unless it happens again, this is it, just the… um four of us.""Yes." Hermione said and placed her own hands on their joined ones. "Wouldn't want you so exhausted you couldn't eliminate dickless."Harry turned red, while Daphne choked and had to lean over and cough a moment to recover."Merlin Mine, don't do that." He said when it looked like Daphne was going to be alright."Well you did say that when he came out of the cauldron he was nude and it was like a Ken doll." Hermione said in a fairly clinical voice he could easily imagine Madam Pomfrey using.Harry and Daphne shared a look of exasperation at their companion's sense of humor which elicited a soft laugh from the brunette who flicked her hair over her shoulders.Daphne drew her wand, made a quick poking gesture into the spell protecting them and swirled it in a smooth counter-clockwise spiral. When it was about three inches around the spell vanished and they could hear Ginny speaking."But that one of yours was much prettier.""Well if you like it so much, sure add it to your collection. I'll pick up a replacement at some point.""Oh, thank you.""We're back." Daphne said brightly."Sorry about that." Harry said, though he couldn't look up from a point on the wooden floor a few feet from the bed."Unfortunately with those two man-children, it is to be expected." Marlene said somberly. "Though after thinking about it I might have over-reacted a bit more than I should have."Ginny took her hand in support but remained silent.Harry shrugged. "Regardless I've told them both to leave, go to France and seek healing.""Perhaps something good will come of it?" Marlene said. "So what do you think of Ginny's earrings?"Only then did Harry notice that his Ward had a long gold bar spanning her ear, from lobe to about the peak of the helix, both ends had short gold chains dangling from them, each sporting a small emerald."Cool." Harry managed to say."Oh, you're just saying that because of the emeralds." Daphne said but laughed. "They are lovely Gin." She said to the nervous young girl."Yes." Hermione added."Thank you." Ginny said. When no one else spoke up she cleared her throat. "If Lord Black leaving, should we stay here?""Now that's an interesting question indeed." Marlene said into the sudden quiet."Where else would we go?" Harry asked."I do have control of the wards and the elf here." Daphne pointed out."Yes, and that's a very good point." Marlene said. "But we do have several options, and it's worth discussing them.""What about your castle?" Hermione asked."Yes, that's certainly an option. We'd be able to really train there, but none of your friends will be there. I'd actually recommend Longbottom hall or Bones Manor.""What if we visit these other places but live here?" Daphne offered."I agree we shouldn't impose ourselves on the Longbottom's." Harry said. "But we could live at Marlene's."Daphne shook her head. "No, you've got to establish yourself as an adult. You need to live where no one can dispute that. It would be best if we could move to a Potter property." She said, turning to Hermione with a raised eyebrow."Yes it would, but none of them are ready. The manor is a half-reconstructed mess from when Charlus and Dorea were killed, and none of the others were under any real wards. This house has some of the heaviest wards in the country, at least that's what I've read." Hermione said in a single, rushed breath."Breathe darling." Daphne said and patted her knee. "I've never held another ward to compare it to, but yes I'd say these are strong.""I've got an idea." Harry said and the girls, including Ginny laughed which caused him to join them. "Yeah I know, run now…" That caused some coughing before they settled down a few minutes later."Sorry Harry." Marlene said. "Please, what did you think of?""Well. What if we send both Neville and Susan letters about visiting them for a day, not to spend the night mind you. I really want to get into some training like what we started in the basement. You have something like that room at your castle?" he asked looking at Marlene."Certainly.""And it's up to date." Daphne added."What if we spend mornings at Castle McKinnon, training, then come back here for the afternoon and evening. We can use that time to recover our magic, read, or work on potions?""We need to add visits to our friends for some of those." Hermione added."I'd love to have my sister visit us for a few days." Daphne added. "Though she'd need to stay with Gin." She ended with a deep blush.This made their silent Ward speak up for the first time since she started the conversation. "I don't know her well, but we don't hate one another. Could we invite my friend Luna over too? I know she's a bit odd, but…""Sure." Hermione said when her Ward trailed off uncertainly. "You're allowed your own friends Ginny.""What about the trial?" Harry asked, suddenly serious.Marlene shrugged. "I've not heard anything from Amelia. Hang on, I'll see if she has a minute."With a quick flick of her left wrist her staff appeared, she moved it in a circle and the small mirror she used previously shot from the tip into her other hand. Another flick and the staff vanished wherever it went for storage."Amelia Bones!" she announced, looking into the mirror. Everyone waited, though Hermione was curious about this thing so Daphne began whispering about the communications mirror in her ear."McKinnon, report." Came the Head of the D.M.L.E.'s voice a moment later."Mr. Black and Lupin have traveled to France to seek healing and a trial for Mr. Black." Marlene said."I suppose that's the best we could hope for. But are the wards compromised now?""No, they'd fallen to my niece prior to that. She's also gained the loyalty of the elf." Marlene said."Oh, really? That's an impressive feat, and done so fast. Better watch out McKinnon, that girl will be after your job soon.""She's got a few sprog to push out first." Marlene said, causing everyone else in the room to blush brightly."Is she blushing now?" Amelia asked."They all are." Marlene said, pointing the mirror away from herself for a minute."Well they're all healthy at least.""Yes, but our resident hero is concerned about his trial." Marlene said, once again with the mirror facing herself."Ah, I do have a date on that." Amelia said, shuffling through a stack on her desk. "Here, August 14th, 9am courtroom ten.""Though we should be there by seven." Marlene immediately added."Yes, that's a fair statement. What's your defense?""First that Mr. Potter was not anywhere near there when it supposedly happened. Second he was under my protection at the—""No." Hermione said, quickly moving to stand beside the Hit Witch. "Sorry Madam Bones, but in order to protect Marlene's status as a Hit Witch, we really need to save that information. Instead we must focus on the fact that Harry was already a recognized adult.""What?""He was forced to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, by his Magical Guardian, Albus Dumbledore, and the designated Ministry representative, Mr. Crouch. As such his name was recorded in the book. The Headmaster left us a note that he was able to locate that information.""Really? My, my." Amelia said and then laughed, clapping her hands several times."Sorry." Marlene said a moment later. "I got caught up in my own desire to defend Harry to remember that."No one answered in words, but Hermione turned and hugged her gently before planting a soft kiss on her cheek."So." Amelia said after a moment. "Is that all for now?""Yes, Madam." Marlene said, still blushing from Hermione's actions.}-{Fleur Delacour strode into St. Mungo's and up to the reception desk. "I am looking for William Weasley, he was harmed by an Auror.""What?" the receptionist asked in shock.Fleur snapped her fingers in front of the woman's face. "Non, where iz he?""Um…" she mumbled and flipped through a book on the desk. "Spell damage ward, chamber 243, that's on the second floor." She said pointing to the lifts.Ignoring the men staring at her fine ass Fleur dropped a galleon tip on the desk and strode over to the lifts. The second floor was much quieter than the ground floor. The Ward was sparsely populated and no one guarded the halls. She studied the plaques on the wall, some pointing left, some right, and some up. It seemed that 243 was to the left so she spun on her heel and strode in that direction.The door was easy to recognize as there were the two Aurors that she had incapacitated with her enchanted chain spell. They flinched when she drew close."I will see Mr. Weasley." She said firmly to the taller one as he was on her side of the door, in her left hand she held up a small stone token from Amelia Bones."If that's what the boss wants, then sure." He said, barely keeping a scowl from his face.But she could read him easily, he hated her kind, considered them non-humans and barely better than animals. She ignored her desire to eviscerate him here in the hallway, after all if she did, then they had a high likelihood of saving his pathetic life. Instead she stepped between them and into the room.William was not awake, he was slightly propped up in the bed, his Gringott's fang still dangled from his ear, but his long red hair had been removed. He was now completely bald. There was no one else in the room so she went to the monitoring board to inspect his health.She knew only a little of this, his heart was strong and his magic appeared normal. She knew he was a strong wizard, or he would not have the job he excelled at, but seeing the numbers she just managed to prevent herself from laughing. She far exceeded Mr. William Weasleys magical strength. Though this could be lower than normal due to his injury. She would withhold her judgement until later.Fleur turned her attention to the man himself, he was breathing regularly, though seemed a bit pale through his tan."Madam?" a man said as he stepped into the room. He was not wearing a medical robe, but stood as her father often did, with a lot of authority.Her wand was in her hand and at the ready before he had finished entering the room. "I am Fleur Delacour, Mr. Weasley iz my instructor at Gringotts." She said in as normal a tone as she could manage. To provide proof of her statement she flicked her head and held her hair back to display the fang that dangled from her own ear. "I am attempting to discern his status before reporting to our superiors at zee bank."He nodded once and then closed the door. She was now alone in the room with this man and an unconscious instructor. It made her feel a bit threatened, but she maintained her slightly tense stance as the man did not draw his wand.Fleur's own wand was lowered through sheer force of will. She would not appear a frightened peasant in front of this man!"I am Special Investigator Richard Evaren, Madam Bones sent me to investigate the assault upon you and Mr. Weasley here. As you are conscious, what can you tell me of the encounter?""Zo you are a War Wizard as my employers say?"The first sign of hesitation crossed his eyes at her question before he gave her a brief nod. "Madam Bones said you were sharp and had clearance.""My Fazzer, iz zee Chief of French Intelligence." She said softly and pulled her badge from the hidden pocket of her robe.Robert barely glanced at her badge before presenting his own to alleviate her fears. "What happened?"She put her wand away along with her badge before collecting her thoughts and speaking."William and I walked out of the main door of zee bank, I was a few feet in front of him. When we were perhaps a hundred and fifty meters from zee apparition point I felt spells coming at me, zoh I moved to zee side and drew my wand. William was already on zee ground about three meters away. I conjured a weighted chain and sent it at zee two guarding this door."She gestured at it before pacing a few feet away and then turning to face him over William. "Zee chain broke the taller one's wand arm, and was choking the shorter one. The remaining two, Auror Captain Shacklebolt and someone I do not know, cast a bone-breaker and a severing charm at me. I dodged them and removed the unknown man's wand hand. Only zen did Auror Captain Shacklebolt speak to me and ask for pax.""You mean peace?""Oui, zis is what I zed."Richard shook his head. "No, I'm having a hard time understanding some of your words."Fleur blushed and looked at her hands. She often had this trouble when she became passionate about a topic. "Oui, sorry. I ave a ard time when I am emotional.""So the Auror Captain asked for peace? Then what?" Richard asked after she remained silent for a minute or so.Fleur sighed and looked up again. "He finally told me zey were Aurors! I was shocked of course, for zey had attacked us. I canceled my chain and zose two men took William and zee handless man here. Auror Captain Shacklebolt asked me to go to zee ministry wiz him. Zat was zee end of zee conflict.""So you did not see what happened to Mr. Weasley? Had he drawn his wand?"Fleur shook her head slowly. "Non, E was too far behind me and I did not sense zee spell. His wand was still in his wrist olster. But it was Auror Captain Shacklebolt who approached from behind us, zee ozzer men were beside and in front of us."Richard leaned against the wall, beside the door and closed his eyes a moment. He looked far from relaxed so Fleur tensed, her hand ready to draw her wand at the first hint of a spell from him. Hit Wizards were respected for a reason after all."Mr. Weasley may never recover. His brain is damaged and the first mental healer to try went into labor before she was able to address the problem. The other Gringotts certified mental healer has been called in, but he will not be here for several hours. At this time I must fault Captain Shacklebolt and his team. The ministry will be paying for the medical costs and likely owe his family a stipend to take care of him if he does not recover his abilities.""I shall inform my superiors of his medical condition and zee prospect of recovery." Fleur said, taking a few steps closer to the door."Yes, please do. The Ministry will also owe them recompense." Richard said, finally opening his eyes and stepping away from the door. "And remember my title is Special Investigator."Fleur gave him a shallow bow, which felt strange to her as she was accustomed to curtsying, but this was the way of the English. Two minutes later she exited the hospital and activated her homing portkey, built into the fang's magic, and swirled away to report on what had happened.}-{"Well brother, are we really doing this?" Sirius asked his old friend.Remus shrugged. "It appears we have little choice." He said holding his hand out for the end of the gold chain Lord Black held.Instead of replying, he draped the links over his friends hands and pressed his wand-tip to it. With a surge of magic they were whisked away into the ether.The spinning seemed to go on and on, just before he lost consciousness there was a great crash, Moony cried out in pain and then his own world went dark.}-{The Weasley Matriarch was beyond angry. How dare the Ministry investigate a pure blood house! They had rights! What happened in her house was not any of their business!Her poor twins, they couldn't get hard anymore, no matter how much their girls tried! That Greengrass bitch had to have done something to them. Fortunately they were gifted at potions and thought they had an idea that would work, so she'd left them to work it out with their girls under heavy lust potions. What boy wouldn't get hard with two hot girls making one another cum until they passed out?And young Harry was trapped now by the mudblood and the ruthless manipulator. How would she get potions into them now to free him for her Ginny?Where was her precious daughter? What was she being told about all of this?But she would not despair or cry out. She was in the right, even if the Weasley family had lost many of their titles over the years, they were still an Ancient Pure Blood family. Plus she was from the Prewett line, which carried to each of her children. They would have more social standing once the title properly fell to her William. Since the Prewett line was patriarchal, her first born son would inherit the title. He would be the head of two families.

Chapter 20Castle McKinnon was a true fortress. They arrived in a small, windowless, room. At first there didn't even appear to be a door, until Marlene stepped towards one rune-covered wall. Then the outline of a door appeared and the section of the wall in the middle vanished."This is the only room where apparition or portkey will work. The wards re-direct all such to here. The wards summon me, or Daphne, and will actively attack anyone trying to circumvent them." She said as she led them up a tight spiral stairs."Are we alone here?" Harry asked."No." Daphne answered from just behind him. "There are servants, elves, and other allies.""Most of my fellow Hit Wizards, and all of the Witches, call this their home." Marlene said as they reached the top of the stairs and walked out into a large hall.The room was similar to the great hall at Hogwarts, in that banners and tables were present, but the people eating were dressed for war instead of classes. Each had on heavy dragon hide vests or robes. They immediately noticed their entrance to the room and the two men and six women stood at once, bowing and curtsying to Marlene, while several servants quickly used their wands to set the next table for the new arrivals."Have you returned home Lady?" a tall man asked as he put his wand away."No Randolph." Marlene said. "Though, I will be visiting more frequently to see to my charges training.""Very well Lady." He said without any concern. "Should I prepare chambers?""Two." Daphne answered quickly. "One for the Ward of House Potter, the other for myself, Lord Potter and his Consort.""Of course Mistress." Randolph said and gave them all a quick bow. "Breakfast is ready if any of you are interested.""Yes, please." Daphne said while Marlene stepped over to the fighters at the other table and warmly greeted them.Harry was quite surprised to see them all act as equals, though they could all be the Hit Witches and Wizards she'd mentioned earlier.After a brief round of introductions, none of them admitted to being co-workers of Marlene, but all seemed competent and prepared to fight, they sat down for breakfast."Randolph, and his family have served mine for centuries. He's actually the Seneschal of the castle, responsible for overall readiness and supplies." Marlene said while scooping eggs onto her plate."Where are we, in England that is?" Hermione asked. "Somewhere to the East I think.""Correct." Marlene said. "We're a few miles north of Kings Lynn, near the mouth of the Great Ouse."Once they had all eaten Daphne gave them a brief tour of the castle while her aunt went off with Randolph to discuss some issues he wanted her input on. The view from the residential tower was shocking. The sea occupied the entire north view, the outer walls were close to the water, while to the south the town of Kings Lynn was visible in the distance. East and West was farmland and as Hermione pointed out, a National Nature Reserve.The view of the castle itself showed that the outer wall encompassed a fairly small area, with several buildings in addition to the one they were atop. "It's compact, but with expansion charms and the underground chambers, plenty large enough for several hundred to live comfortably." Daphne explained."Yeah, It's just hard to get my muggle-raised brain used to those things." Harry said with a laugh."How many people do live here?" Hermione asked."Several dozen, we'd need to ask Randolph for an exact number." Daphne said with a shrug which made her lover frown at such an imprecise answer. "Let me show you the dueling room, and then I think we have to meet Aunt M. for the trip to Longbottom Hall." Daphne said.}-{"Welcome to Longbottom Hall." Neville said when they arrived in his parlor. Beside him stood Susan Bones, while an imposing older woman sat by the fire."Thank you Neville." Harry said and shook hands with his often-timid friend."I'd like to formally introduce my Grandmother, Madam Longbottom." Neville said, turning and indicating the woman in the chair."Madam." Harry said and kissed the back of her hand."Welcome to our home Lord Potter." She said, sounding far stronger than she appeared. "And whom else do you bring with you?" she said, looking suspiciously at Daphne who waited painfully erect beside Hermione while her aunt hovered in the background."Only those whom I trust completely." He said, turning to indicate his Consort first. "My dearest friend, Hermione Granger, who will become Lady Potter and is currently my Consort."Susan gasped at that, and blushed brightly when everyone turned to her.Neville managed a weak smile while his gran's lips turned into a tight line. She did brush her fingers against Hermione's when she approached, though neither said a word."Beside my future lady is our Ward, Ginevra Weasley. She owes me a life debt and I've taken responsibility for her schooling and care.""I've heard of some unpleasantness regarding them." Madam Longbottom said, looking intently at Ginny to see if she would flinch away."I informed the Aurors as to what my mum and brothers were doing." Ginny said softly and only after Hermione had taken her hand."Then perhaps there is some honor left among that family." Madam Longbottom said.Ginny was unable to reply, stepping back and half-hiding behind Hermione's shoulder."Madam." Harry said sharply enough to get the old woman to pay attention to him, and scowl. "Though I've yet to hear of a trial, I believe the guilty have been captured." When she reluctantly nodded he continued. "Several weeks ago I discovered I had become Heir to the House of Black, owing partially to my Gran being of that house. As such a contract was enacted, and I became betrothed to Daphne Greengrass."He held his left hand out to the girl who was standing as tense as a marble statue, and expressing just as much warmth towards their reception so far. She flowed to him, taking his hand lightly with her right and dropping to a precisely measured curtsy of equals."Madam Augusta Longbottom." Daphne said, knowing the woman's given name, though it hadn't been mentioned, "With us is my Aunt Marlene McKinnon, I'm certain you recognize the Spear of the Light."Neville's Gran jerked as though slapped, suddenly realizing the woman towering behind the children was indeed the last of that line. She gestured to Neville who quickly helped her stand, only for her to drop into a deep curtsy, which he had to help her rise from."Lady, you bring much honor to this house." She said as she rose, looking quite pensive at the frown on Marlene's face."I don't know," Marlene said stiffly. "Your oldest allies stand in your home, and yet you act as though those associated with them are beneath you. Perhaps Lord Potter and his ladies will not be visiting your home once a week for lessons. I'm certain my Seneschal can perform those duties."Madam Longbottom trembled on Neville's arm while Susan, who had yet to be formally introduced, stood swaying as though unable to decide which way to move. She suddenly curtsied deeply towards Harry and Marlene. She remained dipped as she spoke. "The Ancient and Most Noble House of Bones, will stand with Potter and McKinnon."Only after she finished did she stand and step to Hermione's side. "Congratulations." She said. "If anyone can deal with all of the crap he gets into it's you."Hermione laughed, shattering much of the tension in the room, and then pulled Susan into a one-armed hug of thanks."Longbottom will also support our allies." Neville said, though his gran scowled down at him. "To the last breath, as sworn.""Thank you Nev." Harry said, though didn't move. It seemed that only his light grip on Daphne's wand hand was allowing her to contain her temper."We shall." Madam Longbottom finally said and collapsed into her chair again.}-{Sirius Black groaned and rolled onto his side clutching his head."Lie still." Remus said from a few feet away."What happened?"Then a voice he didn't know spoke up, forcing Sirius to sit up and look around the room in spite of his pounding head and aching arm."You arrived rather unexpectedly in the location of the old foyer." It was a distinguished older man, likely in his sixties or so, he continued speaking, ignoring Sirius' astonishment. "Since we believed all of the portkeys for that room had long faded, we took no precautions during our remodeling several decades ago. Unfortunately that meant the two of you landed where a wall stood, and thus your injuries.""Wh—" Was as far as Sirius got before the man interrupted him."I am Lord Nicholas Furieux, as the Black line is known in France." The man said firmly and then paused. In the ensuing silence Sirius was unable to speak."You've been resting nearly twelve hours Sirius." Remus said. "I recovered a bit quicker and explained to Lord Furieux who we were and what we needed.""You see Lord Black, my father broke off all contact with your branch of the family when they allied with the Dark Lord. Your, and Andromeda's, personal choices notwithstanding, we saw no point in maintaining the relationship. And then when you were sentenced to Azkaban…" he trailed off shrugging his shoulders."Since we're not restrained, I shall assume you're willing to assist us?" Sirius said.Nodding the French Lord Black responded. "Mr. Lupin shared with me the memory of your discussions just before your departure. I concur that you both need the assistance of a mental healer, and have contacted several who are not only certified, but under oath to this house. Once they are comfortable with your mental stability, your wands will be returned to you and we will begin the process of proving your innocence.""Our wands?" Sirius said, suddenly aware he no longer had one on him."Yes." Lord Furieux said and stood. "Due to the nature of your…issues, none of your attendants or healers will be female. You are restricted to this wing of the house until I judge otherwise.""So we are prisoners!" Sirius said, jumping to his feet.Remus grabbed his arm and jerked him back down with his superior strength."If you choose to see it as such, yes." Lord Furieux said, stepping towards the door. "But I concur with Lady McKinnon. Neither of you are fit and will likely hurt your case if you act out where others could be called to report it at trial.""Thank you." Remus said calmly, still holding Sirius tightly.Lord Furieux bowed his head briefly. "Food will be brought by the elves. Feel free to wander this wing and explore the library in the small study. Rest and recoup, the healers will arrive tomorrow to begin their work."}-{The trial, approached without any further information from Dumbledore. Only the fact that Madam Bones kept Marlene informed allowed them to feel sufficiently prepared. Amelia had been able to get a response from the Headmaster, he would be present at the trial to lead there defense.They were woken by Hermione's alarm spell at five am. The mood was somber while they showered with none of their usual exploration and playfulness. Kreacher had laid out their formal robes, including Hermione's so they all got dressed in the stiff, brocade family robes."I'm going to have to be very formal at court." Daphne said. "You both should try to do so as well. Remember our lessons. No hand shaking Mine, just brush fingers and you've got to stop chuckling when you kiss a woman's hand." She added to Harry who blushed.Daphne added her new anklet to the outside of her left boot and re-applied the sticking charm. Her aunt had enchanted it so it couldn't be summoned, just as she had done to Ginny's new earrings the other day."Why and Ankh?" Harry asked, not really out of curiosity, but to break the oppressive silence."The Ankh represents life, in this case I wear it as a symbol of the life I hope to bring into this world. The children I hope to have with you." Daphne said a bit wistfully as she straightened the laces on her boot."Oh, wow." Harry managed to say, frozen in place.Hermione brushed her hand over his shoulder as she stepped past him to pull their partner into a gentle hug. "You, my lovely snake are a beautiful soul." She said as she pulled back eliciting a deep blush from the usually composed girl.Get your ass over there and hug that young woman! The Harry in his head suddenly yelled at him.He found his feet moving and his arms encompassed the blonde Slytherin just as Hermione pulled away."Thank you. When I was growing up, at my aunt's, I never thought I could have such wonderful women in my life." He said, unsure if it came from him or the Harry in his head.We're both you, numbskull! Came the sarcastic thought in reply."Thank you." Daphne said, trying to compose herself. "Both of you." She added, meeting their eyes briefly before heading out the door where they found Ginny and Marlene waiting for them.Marlene had her own family robes on, the brilliant silver spear embroidered upon her back was partially obscured by her braided hair. But the symbolism was plain to all, she was the Spear of the Light as her father had been before her.It actually made Hermione ponder just what was stored in that vault that Gringotts wanted her to remove. Could it be a magical spear or something similar, like a staff?Ginny looked quite confused but was wearing the black robe the elf had laid out for her, which had the Potter crest on her left shoulder."No matter what, do not leave Hermione's side, Ginevra." Marlene told her as they prepared to leave. "You will have two guards with you that I trust. You will be in the guest box, reserved for relatives of the accused. I grant you permission to defend yourselves if necessary. Let me worry about the consequences if it comes to that.""Yes, thanks." Hermione said giving Harry's hand a tight squeeze."And Harry, they cannot separate you from Daphne. A female Auror, in this case your cousin Nymphadora, will be with you. She's loyal and will defend you both in addition to performing the duty this dictates.""Yes." Harry said and handed his wand to Daphne. As the accused he wasn't allowed to have a wand on him, but she was under no restrictions."So we portkey to the atrium, Nym and a friend of mine will meet us there. Remember formality, no crude jokes and no kissing me." She added the last, looking at Hermione and making her pout briefly.Over the last few days Hermione's attraction to the head of the McKinnon clan had become more pronounced. She couldn't resist kissing her for long and suspected it was her magic also latching onto Harry's final (she hoped) partner.His magic seemed content to pull them together slowly, he thought it was due to the fact that Daphne and Hermione kept him sated so his need was very low to add another willing partner.Marlene for her part sometimes sat beside him at meals, with Hermione moving to her other side, leaving him between aunt and niece for the meal. And other than some kissing now and then, seemed perfectly happy to just learn more about Harry, and by extension Hermione.Curiously there was no change in Daphne's relationship with her aunt. Harry wasn't sure what that would mean when all four of them were in the same bed. Right now it was a full three way relationship and he greatly enjoyed that aspect of it. Would they avoid touching one another during sex? Just how was that going to work out?They each took hold of the silk cord Marlene pulled from an inner pocket. She tapped it with her wand once everyone had a firm hold and they swept away to the atrium of the Ministry of Magic, it was just 6:15am.Daphne latched onto his arm immediately after their arrival. It was perfectly formal but the pressure she was exerting might make his arm fall asleep before they made it to the courtroom.Nym was waiting on a summoned cot, her partner, another woman who looked very imposing, was standing beside the apparition point. It was this woman who gave Marlene a quick hug in greeting and then introduced herself to the others. "I'm Valerie Norwood." She left off her rank, but had strange piping on the collar of her Auror robe that Nym's didn't."Thank you for helping today Val." Marlene said."You'd do the same to me, if my husband ever got arrested." The tall woman replied with a sideways grin."Val?""Yeah, I know." Valerie said and turned to Harry. "Lord Potter, no harm shall befall you or your ladies if I can prevent it.""Thank you Mrs. Norwood." Harry said, and brushed a kiss across the back of her knuckles. He deliberately refrained from asking the woman's rank. She seemed to be cut of similar cloth to Marlene and he suspected she was also a Hit Witch. Certainly the way Nym was deferring to her placed her higher in the chain of command.Hermione, Daphne, and even Ginny brushed their fingers with her in formal greetings, which none of them did with Nymphadora for some reason he couldn't follow."Consort Potter, two of my team are waiting at the entrance to the courtroom to escort you and your Ward. They will remain with you until you are returned to Lord Potter's presence." Valerie said."Thank you." Hermione said and stepped away from Harry's side. Ginny moved with her, looking around the room in wonder.The night guard was still at his post when they had their wands checked. Harry merely said he wasn't carrying one. The man looked at Mrs. Norwood, when she nodded he was allowed through without further protest.Courtroom ten was the largest in the Ministry and had been used for the Death Eater trials at the end of the first war. There were four Aurors on guard at the main door, with two more off to the side. These, Valerie introduced as members of her team. They escorted Hermione and Ginny up the lift to their box for the trial."What are you up to McKinnon?" one of the Auror guards at the door asked when they approached the entrance.Marlene laughed, ignoring the challenge. "Busted back down to Senior Auror already Shacklebolt? What did you do?"The tall black man scowled and his hand flinched towards his wand. He froze when Valerie's wand was poised to cast a spell. "Mrs. Norwood." He said formally and motioned the guards with him to open the door.Yep, she had to be a Hit Witch. Harry thought and relaxed just a little bit.Inside the courtroom, Marlene with a brief nod to Harry, moved up the stairs on the left side to join the other Lords and Ladies present. She stopped frequently on her way to speak with other members who were milling about as well.Harry noticed several of those speaking with her had their heirs with them and seemed to be getting too friendly for his comfort."Stop." Daphne hissed in his ear, disguising it as a kiss to his cheek.That got him immediately back under control and he realized that Marlene was clearly well respected, everyone seemed to want to be seen speaking with her as she ascended to the Ancient and Noble fourth tier. He grinned when he saw one with his family crest beside the one Marlene settled into.She was immediately pulled into a discussion by a tall woman with a vulture atop her head. Harry recognized her as Neville's gran, only after spotting the Longbottom Scion nearby, speaking with Susan Bones.It seemed like being two hours early was the right thing to do as the room was beginning to get crowded."This isn't permitted." Percy Weasley said from just outside the door. He strode over to Harry's group looking quite the agitated fop."What isn't permitted?" Mrs. Norwood said coldly to him.Percy froze in his tracks, looking at her as though she had just appeared out of nowhere. "The Minister left explicit orders, the accused is to be chained and cuffed with magic inhibitors."While Harry bristled Valerie's firm "NO." Brought him back under control."But the Minister!" Percy said, his voice rising by several octaves.Valerie waved dismissively at him. "My orders are from Madam Bones. Speak with her or just try and get past me. I care not, though you will find the second option more painful.""You can't threaten me!" he exclaimed."Move along boy." She said and her wand flicked.Percy was suddenly skipping down the middle of the courtroom loudly crowing like a rooster. He slammed into the side wall and then picked himself up to precariously dance up the stairs and down one of the back corridors. The vast majority of the chamber was staring in shock."That was cool." Nymphadora said in a stage whisper.As though nothing had happened Valerie turned to face them. "You can sit there to wait." She gestured to a padded bench to the side of the doors.Nymphadora took up a post on the far side, a few feet in front of the bench, while Valerie stood closer to the door, wand in hand, as she carefully observed those entering behind them.Daphne used her hand around his elbow to pull him to the bench, where they sat to wait for the trial to start."Where's Dumbledore?" he asked her softly."Not in here yet love." She said, leaning on his shoulder to show her support. "He could be discussing this with his allies, remember he ran the Wizengamot for the last two decades or so, before Fudge got him removed for supporting you on Voldemort's return.""Yeah," Harry said. "Or he's off exploring his sock drawer or something."Daphne just managed to keep from laughing, instead squeezing his arm tightly and burying her face in his chest until she recovered. "Don't do that, you'll mess up my makeup." She whispered a moment later, looking up at him through her lashes.Harry's stomach fluttered and he said the only thing smart men say in these situations. "Yes dear."She patted his arm, graced him with a gentle smile before it vanished and her cold mask returned as she looked around the chamber.Many of those in the stands were staring at them, not comprehending why anyone was with the accused. But Mrs. Norwood seemed to be sufficient deterrent to prevent any of them coming to ask about it. Since none of the Aurors were willing to do anything, the majority of those present merely observed.The exception of course was the frog-lady in pink. Madam Umbridge hurried down to the floor of the courtroom and over to them. She was nearly frothing at the mouth as she did so. It was quite likely that Percy had danced right into her office to complain about his mistreatment.Mrs. Norwood, stepped into her path while Nymphadora decided she should also have her wand in hand and pay more attention to their surroundings."Get out of my way! I'm the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic!""And I'm charged with protecting the accused." Valerie replied calmly."I'll have your badge!""You'll have to discuss that with Madam Bones. Now what do you want?""Why is that harlot with the lying criminal?" She spat out.Everyone who heard the statement froze, except Daphne, who was on her feet in an instant and a resounding slap drew the rest of the courtroom's attention to them.In the ensuing silence Daphne declared. "I am Daphne Greengrass of the Most Noble and Ancient line of Greengrass. I am betrothed to Scion Black, who also happens to be Lord Harry James Potter. Know your place worm!"The magic laced into her voice shoved the large woman back onto the floor as she tried to reach for her wand.Harry's magic had pulled him along with his betrothed, only remembering he didn't have his wand at the last moment. Instead he could only glare down at the disgusting woman.Valerie put her free hand on his chest, giving him a single, concerned, look.That look sent a chill down his spine, he had to control himself in front of all of these witnesses. They were going to have to vote on his innocence."Mrs. Norwood, I believe it is acceptable for a challenge to be issues in this case." He said as calmly and loudly as he could manage."Indeed." Valerie said, not sparing him a glance as several of the Aurors finally reacted and moved towards them.Madam Umbridge picked herself up off the floor. There was a red handprint forming on her left cheek, blood fell from a cut caused by the mass of Daphne's betrothal ring."The Minister will see to you!" Umbridge spat, blood flying from her mouth."The Minister has no jurisdiction over Ancient Family insults." Mrs. Norwood said. "You've insulted both of their families, that entitles them to demand a duel for satisfaction.""What?" Madam Umbridge asked, stumbling backwards and falling on her ass."A duel?" One of the Aurors asked quite loudly bringing an even deeper quiet to the courtroom as everyone who had been ignoring the scene focused on it.Harry spared a glance up to Marlene. She was waiting, half-way down the aisle, wand in hand. He shifted his attention to Hermione on the other side of the room, she too had her wand in hand and Gin was clutching her other hand tightly. Filled with a warmth he was starting to get used to, he cleared his throat."This woman insulted both my betrothed and myself!" Harry said, a bit softer this time as he realized the room was designed to allow their voices to carry. He added a, hopefully, negligent wave of his hand in the frog-bitches direction."You cannot!" The frog croaked boldly."He bears the Lordship ring for House Potter." Daphne said. "He is also the Heir to House Black, and I am betrothed to that aspect of him." She ended holding her left hand out to show the betrothal ring to the Aurors who had come over."Lord Potter, or Lord Greengrass have seven days to issue a challenge, being the insulted party." Mrs. Norwood explained. "For now I suggest we get back to why we are here today.""Just a moment!" A deep voice spoke from the door as Daphne's father entered. "How was I insulted?""Lord Greengrass." Several Aurors and Mrs. Norwood said."Daddy!" Daphne cried out to get his attention. "This woman called me a harlot and my betrothed a lying criminal!" She sounded the perfect, insulted pureblood princess, adding a slight whine to her voice that Harry had never, ever heard from her and hoped it was never directed in his direction. "Let me duel her, I've got those wonderful spells you showed me to try out." She continued, twisting the toe of her right boot on the floor and swaying slightly.Umbridge muttered something and backed away a few steps from the angry Lord but then rallied and tugged her pink robe. "I am the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic. I was merely inquiring as to why she was with the accused.""Listen girl, and I use that term loosely, I don't care if you're Morgana LeFay come back to fuck Merlin back from the dead. Did no one ever teach you to recognize a Lord's ring?" Lord Greengrass said holding up his own ornate ring."House Umbridge is a newly elevated house, only two generations pure." Daphne heard her mother say, only then realizing she was right beside her father, with her little sister holding tightly to her other hand."And that should not excuse her ignorance!" Lord Greengrass barked.The terrified woman in pink turned and fled across the floor of the courtroom."I'll consult with my daughter and Lord Potter before we decide the appropriate response to this insult!" Lord Greengrass added loudly making the woman stumble as she reached the stairs to the Ministers box.Quite a few members of the audience laughed.Harry finally saw Daphne's mother and sister as the group of Aurors moved away. Astoria was a near-clone of her elder sister while their mother was a bit shorter than Marlene and decidedly heavier. She still looked quite lovely, but the difference between them was striking to him. He knew Marlene was younger than her sister, but it appeared to be close to a decade."Lord Greengrass." Harry managed to say, holding his hand out to his soon-to-be father-in-law. If they had been in private Harry would likely have slapped the man just as his daughter had Umbridge, but in this public place, where he was accused of a crime, he needed all of the allies he could get. The man would certainly not do anything publicly to discredit himself.A quick look from the short dark-haired man and he took Harry's hand in his, then clapped his left hand onto the other side, squeezing firmly, but not trying to break his hand.Harry's other arm was being held by Daphne so he wasn't able to reciprocate the gesture, though he did squeeze all the harder with his wand hand.Lord Greengrass released his hand and then Harry moved to Celeste Greengrass to gently kiss the back of her hand. The woman gave him a shallow curtsy, but did not speak. When Harry moved to Astoria, the fourteen year old girl looked to her older sister before extending her hand.Harry brushed a kiss across her dainty hand and then gave her a gentle smile eliciting a light titter of a laugh from her."We have little time here Lord Potter." Malcolm said. "I would like a more lengthy conversation with you at some time.""Certainly." Harry said. "We'll have to coordinate it with Lady McKinnon, and Daphne has expressed interest in having her sister visit for a few days as well.""We shall." Malcolm said and then led his family up to a box on the same side of the courtroom as Hermione, opposite where the Potter and McKinnon box were. He settled into a box near the one with the Black family crest.How was he going to sit both of those boxes? He wondered as Daphne led him back to the bench and sat even closer beside him. She dropped almost all of her formality to hug him. He suddenly realized she was shaking and wrapped both arms around her.For a moment he thought she was crying, but it soon became evident she was trembling in rage. He ran his fingers through her hair and kissed her cheek to help calm her. When she pulled back she placed a kiss on his cheek as well, and then settled beside him."Worms like that make me want to move to Sweden.""Really? I'd like to visit a lot of places. Mine's always talking about France, and we were invite by the French Champion.""And your magic isn't latching onto her?" Daphne asked, not looking at him.He squeezed her hand, causing her to look at him. "No, it isn't. We had a brief fling as Mine told you." He shrugged. "It was fun, but the three of you own my heart.""We will start shortly." Valerie said, breaking into their conversation. "The Ministers box is filling and Madam Bones just took her place.""Ok." Harry said, suddenly light headed. "Where's Dumbledore?""No idea." Valerie said and then sent a Patronus off to locate him.When their Hit Witch protector stepped away Daphne gave him another soft kiss on the cheek. "For what you said a moment ago you're going to get so lucky later."Just as he felt his pants tighten there was a banging staff from the Minister's box and the Aurors came to attention. There was still no sign of Dumbledore."All rise for the Minister of Magic. The Honorable Cornelius Fudge."The Minister for Magic strode out to take his place behind the podium. His first words were not the traditional opening. "Aurors, seal the chamber." He waited, quite impatiently, while the dozen doors banged closed and then a gong went off as a shimmer of magic appeared just inside the doors.Fudge actually looked at Harry and smirked. When the gong faded he banged his gavel. "This courtroom is now in session."But the room shook, making many of those present scream in terror. Then a flash of light made everyone cover their eyes. When the light faded Albus Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the courtroom floor with a preening Phoenix on his shoulder.The ancient Headmaster was holding an iron-capped staff and his purple robes seemed to have a live Quidditch match going on over their surface. Half of the figures were stitched in gold, the other half in silver, while the balls were dark gemstones.Just as Fudge opened his mouth to speak Dumbledore banged his staff three times on the floor, at that the gong happened again, sealing the chamber."You are a fool Cornelius." Dumbledore said, looking around the chamber. "When next you try to bar me entrance, you must first ensure I'm not the holder of the Ward in question. And for the record, I hold the wards for Hogwarts and St. Mungo's as well as the Ministry."No one seemed capable of answering after that so Dumbledore turned to Harry and motioned him forward.Daphne dragged him forward until they stood beside Dumbledore."And a good morning to you Lord Potter and your future Lady Black." Dumbledore said with a slight bow.Harry managed to mimic the bow while Daphne dipped a shallow curtsy. "And a good morning to you sir." He said through trembling lips."Now see here!" Fudge spoke up from above them."I think that's enough, don't you?" Dumbledore replied to the Minister who seemed utterly confused by that."Albus?" Madam Bones asked from her podium.A flash of light seemed to go off in Dumbledore's robes, but when Harry looked it was just the seekers chasing the golden Snitch down his left arm. It vanished into the gold trim at the end and they went back to searching for it."Ah, good morning Amelia, are we ready to begin already? Last I heard it wasn't until nine and it's just seven now.""Yes." Madam Bones said with a glance at the Minister."Oh, yes, our corrupt Minister was trying to pull one over on us." Dumbledore said making a large portion of those in the chamber gasp."What? I assure you he is corrupt. Gringotts has the evidence of all the bribes he's accepted over the years.""They were donations!" Fudge yelled."We'll address your transgressions a later trial. Now, since this is a farce, I will present the only relevant bits of information and we can all get on with our day.""What?" the Minister yelled.Daphne pointed to the back of Dumbledore's robe where the scoreboard was. It suddenly shifted to 'Relax' before going back to the score. The Wasps were up by sixty on the lowly Cannons."First, there is no evidence against the accused. Why you ask? Simply because Mr. Potter has not had the trace upon him since October 31st of last year."Dumbledore walked a slow circle around Harry and Daphne, looking up into the gallery, waiting for the loud discussion his proclamation had caused to die down.When it began to quiet he rapped his staff once. "Please view the evidence now before you of this." He said loudly. In front of each member of the Wizengamot a copy of the book appeared for them to view themselves."When Mr. Potter was forced to compete in the Tri Wizard Tournament, a Ministry sponsored event, which was restricted to Of Age participants. He was emancipated. As the rules of the Tournament, as judged by Magic itself, superseded his actual age.""Is this verified?" Madam Bones asked, being one of the few in the room who had an inkling of this turn of events."It is Madam." Albus Dumbledore said, giving her a bow."So where did the evidence of the Trace come from?" She continued, turning to the Minister who now resembled his green bowler hat.Harry's attention was grabbed by the Seekers on Dumbledore's robe. The gold Seeker for the Wasps executed a Wronski Feint, burying his opponent in the trim at the bottom of the shimmering robe. The gold Seeker pumped his arm at his fellow gold-stitched teammates before taking off at top speed towards Dumbledore's right shoulder where the Snitch had again appeared. The score was 110 to 20, Wasps up over the Cannons.Another sharp rap of the Headmaster's staff called his attention back to the courtroom. "I believe Madam, that evidence is on your desk now.""Aurors' arrest Madam Umbridge immediately." Madam Bones said after a brief look at the papers before her."But she's my Undersecretary." Fudge said a bit petulantly."So you claim responsibility for her blackmailing Madam Hopkirk?" Madam Bones asked coldly.The Minister could only gulp and crush his bowler hat to his chest.The Aurors confiscated Madam Umbridge's wand and silenced her before leading her out of the Minister's box and over to the side of the chamber. They couldn't leave as the room was still sealed."I move that the charges against Lord Potter be dismissed!" Marlene said firmly in the silent chamber."Seconded!" Lord Greengrass said just before Madam Longbottom could."Members of the Wizengamot, please make your vote known by showing red sparks for guilty, gold for innocent." Madam Bones announced into the chamber.No matter where Harry looked he didn't see a single red spark in the chamber.Daphne bumped his shoulder and pointed at Dumbledore's robe where the Wasp's Seeker was lifting his arm in triumph as his teammates flew to surround him."Innocent of all charges!" Madam Bones announced, banging her own gavel."I move we re-instate Dumbledore as the Head of the Wizengamot!" Madam Longbottom said when the chamber grew quiet enough for her to be heard."Seconded." The Bones Proxy, who was sitting beside a grinning Susan, said."Wait." Madam Bones said. "I've a trial to complete before other business can be addressed."Though Dumbledore was grinning he did not speak up, waiting patiently for Madam Bones to conclude the trial."Lord Potter, the Ministry finds you innocent and furthermore, awards you a thousand galleon award for the false accusation. Let the records be cleared. Lord Potter is an adult in the eyes of Magic, and I for one will not contest it. You may also appoint a proxy to sit your box as the law states you must attain seventeen summers prior to yourself taking that seat." The Head of the D.M.L.E. said, officially ending the trial."Now." She continued when the discussion ebbed. "I am going to right another wrong."Harry wondered if she was suddenly going to pardon Sirius."Since Mr. Potter and his ladies have been run through the gutter by the Prophet, I will allow them a few minutes to speak before we move on to other business."Oh, Harry thought, a bit depressed yet excited at the chance."Consort Potter, would you please join them?" Madam Bones asked.Hermione stood, with Ginny right behind her. "Thank you Madam." She said and then followed one of Valerie's team down the stairs while the other came behind their Ward.When Hermione arrived she stepped to Harry's other side while Ginny waited a pace to her left."Thank you Madam Bones." Harry said. "I am Lord Potter and Heir Black, for those of you who had yet to catch that. To my left is my future Lady Potter, my ever-faithful friend and Consort, Hermione Granger."Hermione gave a short curtsy."And to my right is the dangerous and lovely Daphne Greengrass, my Betrothed for House Black."Daphne gave an even shallower curtsy."Ginevra Weasley, owes me a life debt, she is currently the Ward of House Potter and was instrumental in uncovering her mother's plot against me and mine. Something I hope will yet be resolved in this very court.""Who is Lord Black?" someone from the light side of the room shouted.There was a continual murmur and Daphne whispered to him. "Tell them."His eyebrows went up and he slowly nodded.Raising his hand for silence, which he received almost immediately, he spoke. "Lord Black is my oath-sworn God-Father: Sirius Black."When the tumult did not seem to end Dumbledore pounded his staff on the floor once again, which immediately brought the room back to silence. Instead of speaking the ancient warlock looked back to Harry."He was not my parents betrayer, that was Peter Pettigrew, who is a rat animagus and escaped into the sewers, leaving Sirius to take the blame. Lord Black is currently in France, recovering from his years of false imprisonment and seeking justice in that country."Again Dumbledore was forced to use his staff to return order. This time he spoke into the silence. "Mr. Potter and his ladies have proven their abilities to me. I commend them on their speaking the truth when it was not the easy thing to do.""Lord Potter, you and your ladies, may retire. All charges are dismissed and a statement will be printed on the front page of the Prophet to inform the public." Amelia said.Harry bowed as his ladies and ward curtsied. "Thank you Madam." Harry said and headed from the room with a lady on each arm.Valerie and Nymphadora were just in front of them while the other members of her team came behind Ginny.Dumbledore's magic flared and the shimmering field over the door vanished."Aurors, you may remove Madam Umbridge from this chamber." Amelia said as Harry and his party walked down the hallway outside of the courtroom.Wow, Dumbledore's still got it. Harry two said in his head. Why are you calling me two? We're both you, I can even control our body when you're being an idiot. I just get more time to think and understand what is happening.I'm not… well I guess I am. Sorry. So what do you think is going to happen now, both Umbridge and Fudge were completely humiliated.Who knows, I still don't understand all of this political crap. We'll need the girl's input. But the first order of business is to kiss the hell out of Marlene!Oh yeah, I'm a recognized adult now. Damn I should have said something about her when Madam Bones let me talk.Well I didn't think of it either.They arrived at the apparition point. "Marlene has the portkey." He said."Yes." Hermione said."I've got the portkeys to either Castle McKinnon or House Black." Daphne said."Black." Harry said and held out his hand.When his Ward and Ladies took hold he turned to Valerie. "Thank you Mrs. Norwood. House Potter thanks you for your assistance today.""Most welcome Lord Potter. I enjoyed the show, and being able to slap those bastards down." She grinned as Daphne activated the portkey.

Chapter 21They arrived back in Black Manor just before 8am. Kreacher was waiting beside the portrait of his ancestor, both grew silent at their arrival."And how did House Black fare this day?" Walburga asked."Charges dismissed, the Minister has been utterly shamed by Dumbledore, and his Undersecretary arrested." Daphne said."Most excellent. Kreacher, a celebratory toast." Walburga said.The elf snapped his fingers and a small glass of a smoldering Amber liquid appeared before each of them. The former Lady Black picked one up from a table outside of the view of the portrait and held it up in salute."Firewhisky," Daphne whispered while taking hers from mid-air. "Sip it." She added, turning to Ginny behind her she repeated the warning to sip, and lifted hers on high.When the others had taken theirs Lady Black looked to Daphne who quickly provided a toast. "In honor of the Heir to House Black being absolved and his accusers beaten." She sipped from her glass, an action quickly followed by the others, both living and non.Harry, Hermione, and Ginny immediately coughed a small tongue of flame and then the sensation was gone, moving down their throats to settle like a bubbling cauldron in their stomachs. Daphne and Walburga merely closed their eyes while the sensation passed through them.Fortunately their glasses vanished after that so none of them were subjected to further pain and torture."Wow.""I'd rather not do that again." Ginny said looking for a glass of water, which Kreacher quickly provided for each of them."And where is Lady McKinnon?" Walburga asked.Harry stepped a few paces closer to the portrait so he didn't have to speak so loudly before answering. "The Wizengamot is still in session. I don't know when she will be back.""And how does your magic feel about this?" The portrait pushed him.He closed his eyes, Hermione embraced him. He didn't need to look, he knew it was her in his bones, or magic, or whatever it was telling him these things."Unhappy." He whispered, receiving a nod from the brunette in his arms. "My magic is unhappy." He said loud enough for those in the room to hear."Good." Walburga said. "Thank you for answering honestly Heir. I will retire to another portrait and spread the news of your success at trial today."A hand lightly pressed his cheek, longer nails than the lady in his arms had and opened his eyes to look into Daphne's ice-grey orbs. The portrait behind her was empty. A quick glance told him that Ginny was sitting in one of the many chairs, wrapped in a thick afghan and hugging herself."I feel it too love." Hermione said from his chest."And you Daphne? What is your magic doing?" Harry found himself asking.Her beautiful red lips turned downwards but she answered readily enough. "I've always loved my aunt. She always took us out of the house when father allowed. And then she freed me from him, by trouncing him in a duel, and I've lived with her since. We've never…" She finally hit a troubled spot and hesitated a moment."We've never been intimate in any way, like Mine and I. Though we've shared showers and baths on occasion." She shrugged. "Yes, I'm attracted to her, always have been, but I don't know how that's going to evolve."He squeezed her hand, he wasn't aware he was holding until that moment. "I'm still working through it myself, but I was worried you'd feel awkward about the whole situation.""No," she smiled and shook her head slowly. With a glance to where Ginny sat she kissed him and then Hermione's pouting lips. "We should distract ourselves, but your Ward should not be left alone. Time for some wandless magic practice."And like she'd been dipped in an invigorating drought, Hermione lit up in excitement. She shifted to pull Daphne to the nearest couch, leaving Harry suddenly missing her warmth. With a chuckle he joined them, motioning Ginny to move closer.}-{Some days being the 'Spear of the Light' was a boring exercise in holding her temper. After the brief recess, where Harry and the girls were allowed to leave, and Umbridge removed, the Wizengamot settled in for a fairly lengthy, and complex, trial. It was time to sort out the Weasleys.As she'd taken Ginny's testimony, and heard of the evidence found from her Co-Hit Witch, there was little new for her. They had to take it slow though as Amelia presented the information to them."Members of the Wizengamot." Amelia said, while Dumbledore sat in a conjured chair in the precise center of the chamber and Fudge sweated in his chair. "We will now hear evidence in regard to the case Lord Potter referenced, the Weasley Family."When the excited babble receded she continued. "Ginevra Weasley, gave sworn evidence, in the presence of an Auror, and Hit Witch. This evidence was that her mother, Molly Weasley, had obliviated her father, Arthur, and fed him love potions for as long as she knew. She also had planned to dose Lord Potter and his Consort with Love potions to have them wed two of her children."Valerie Norwood stepped forward, until she was beside the chair Albus Dumbledore sat frowning in. Madam Bones then banged her gavel. "Mrs. Norwood is the Special Investigator I assigned to this case. But first the accused."The prisoners circle, close to the Minister's box, vanished, and the majority of the Weasley family rose up, each bound by magic inhibiting cuffs, to large stone chairs. They were also muted as Molly Weasley appeared to be yelling at the top of her lungs, yet went unheard."Thank you Madam Bones." Valeria began. "We have confirmation, of the stated charges. Arthur Weasley is currently in the Excessive Potion Ward at St. Mungo's where they are attempting to slowly wean him from almost thirty years of being dosed with both Love and Loyalty potions. His prospects of recovery are not good. Both potions were keyed, and brewed by his spouse Molly Prewett-Weasley. Evidence was found during the initial investigation of both potions along with several others, keyed to young women, some of which were unwillingly present at the time of the investigation. These young ladies have been freed of their potion haze, and then presented their own evidence. Though at this time two of the young ladies are of age, the evidence collected shows they were first subjected to potions in their fifteenth year."Valerie paused, taking a sip from a glass of ice water that had appeared in front of her, courtesy of the man sitting beside her. She sipped again and waited for the murmurs to fade."All members of the Weasley family have now been interviewed, those under age, with the consent of Arthur. The only ones unaware of this, and now cleared of charges, are William, Charlie, Ginevra, and reluctantly Percy. Unfortunately William is also in St. Mungo's after suffering a bludgeoner to the back of his head. His prospects of recovery are also bleak. After extensive interviews, both verbal and mental, we've discovered that Molly Weasley performed all of these crimes in an attempt to restore her maiden family to prominence."Dumbledore suddenly stood, drawing the attention of the room and utter silence. "Many of you will remember the tales of the Prewett family's downfall. Several members sided with Grindlewald, and were subsequently killed in battle. Including a very memorable duel between Lord McKinnon and Lord Prewett, in which Lord Prewett killed himself and three of his family when it became obvious he could not win. This was done by shattering his own key ward stone, destroying their ancestral manor and most of their prized possessions. I myself interviewed the three remaining Prewetts, Fabian, Gideon, and Molly. The twins were of great help to the light during the battles against Voldemort, though they were each finally slain, while Molly seemed to settle down with Arthur. I can honestly say that I was unaware of the circumstances within their home."He bowed to Valerie, dismissed his chair, and walked to the stairs, finally stepping into the Minster's box. He ignored the Minister who had yet to move or speak, instead sat clutching his bowler hat to his chest. Dumbledore nodded to the Hit Witch who stood waiting alone in the center of the chamber."Thank you Sir." Valerie said. "Molly Prewett grew up in the splendor of Prewett Manor, with servants and elves at her beck and call. Apparently she believed that such was her due, and pushed Arthur to provide this to her. When he could not advance fast enough, she turned to further use of potions. Gringotts presented me with a statement, in her maiden name, that showed she secretly had nearly a hundred thousand galleons in her own personal vault. We believe this was attained through sale of illegal potions, though that trail went cold. Yet with all this wealth her children wore paupers clothes and had second hand schoolbooks."Valerie paused again, drinking from the glass Dumbledore had provided earlier."Thank you Mrs. Norwood." Amelia said. "The actual charges are thus against Molly Weasley, line theft. Use of love and loyalty potions on the Head of an Ancient House, use of love and lust potions on three minor girls, use of a ghoul as a sex object. I will not go into details of these crimes as frankly they sicken me. Further charges are against three of her minor children. Fred and George Weasley are charged with illegal potion experimentation on two minor girls including those sexual in nature. Ronald Weasley is charged with attempted rape of the daughter of an Ancient House.""We shall now hear from the accused." Amelia said, though it was clear she was not looking forward to this part of the trial.As the silence was lifted from them the first voice heard was from the youngest male, Ronald. "I accuse Harry bloody Potter of stealing my witch! I was there when she was saved, she should be sucking my cock, not his! My mum promised I could have any bint I wanted."As the chamber sat in shock the voice was suddenly cut off. Dumbledore's wand flashed back into his robe. "Mrs. Norwood, was the validity of the life-debt tested?""Not by myself sir, but yes, and I have absolute trust in the one who performed it." Valerie said."I'm afraid we must have the name." He said."I verified it." Marlene said firmly, standing in her family box. "Consort Potter was placed in danger by the words of Ronald Weasley, therefore cannot benefit from her rescue, which Lord Potter initiated and Ronald reluctantly went along with. Magic showed that Consort Potter is tied so tightly to her Lord that only death can separate them.""Thank you Lady McKinnon." Dumbledore said and she returned to her seat, though many of her fellows were suddenly filled with questions. "Let the records show that the life-debt owed by Hermione Granger falls solely upon Harry Potter. As verified by Lady McKinnon.""As we have now heard from the youngest, let us proceed to the twins." Amelia said and nodded to Dumbledore who selectively removed the silence from the two red-headed menaces. "Fred and George Weasley, you have heard the crimes you are accused of, do you have anything to say for yourselves?""We." One of them started but then looked at the floor."Mum said it was the way things were done, and at first it seemed to be just in great fun." The other said softly, though the acoustics of the chamber allowed most present to hear it well enough."I'd like to apologize." The first twin said, lifting his head to Amelia. "It seemed wrong, but I didn't question it."Since neither of them seemed willing to speak further Dumbledore again silenced them. "With my long relationship with this family I must recommend the maximum punishment for these crimes." He said softly as though not quite sure he should say anything, yet knowing everyone in the chamber was looking to him for direction."That's for later, and as yet, you're not officially present." Amelia said with an indulgent smile, though she made no move to protest his seat in the Minister's box or his control of the trial."I claim the Prewett Lordship." Were the first words Molly spoke upon the lifting of the silence spell."The Prewett Lordship is patriarchal and I believe requires a male of more than half Prewett blood. None of which currently exist as your son's are only half." Madam Longbottom said loudly, clearly angry at the witch.Instead of cowing her, Molly lifted her chin. "Then test Ginevra, she is more than half, her firstborn son will inherit then and she will restore me to my rightful place in life."The volume in the chamber went up dramatically and Dumbledore again silenced Molly and a moment later the bang of his staff brought the rest of the chamber to silence."Mrs. Norwood?" he asked her with a raised eyebrow."Yes." She said and then finished the glass of water before speaking again. "I'd hoped this bit of Weasley family history would be buried. When William Weasley was being treated in St. Mungo's it was revealed that it was in fact he who fathered Ginevra, upon his own mother. Molly apparently used her favorite combination of loyalty and lust potions upon William to get him to participate, and then obliviated the knowledge from his mind."Molly, who could hear everything, but not respond, held her head up proudly in spite of the chaos such a statement caused in the chamber.When Amelia looked green Albus banged his staff and stood. "Such information will destroy the young lady in question. I shall not allow that to happen. None present will be able to disclose it to another, in any form. Should the lady come forward herself then this compulsion will fade." With that proclamation his magic flared, aided by the wards of the Ministry the force pushed everyone back in their seats.His gaze swung about the chamber, looking every bit the conqueror of Grindlewald and the greatest wizard since Merlin. He avoided looking up at Lady McKinnon, who was doing a credible job of looking like she had also been affected by his magic. The young lady, and her Lord, needed to be informed of this so he'd deliberately excluded her.Satisfied he turned his attention back to Molly. "Your declaration is invalid, you cannot claim Lordship of a patriarchal line. Do not speak of irrelevant things. Is there anything you have to say in your defense?"She only seemed partially cowed, her gaze shifting about the chamber for support. "I am the last full Prewett, I've resurrected my line.""That is for the Wizengamot to decide." Dumbledore said, sliding to his seat as utter silence descended upon the chamber.It took Amelia a few minutes to get herself back on track and clear her throat. "We've now heard the charges, and the accused have spoken. We shall begin with the greatest charge, Line theft. By using Love potions on Arthur to get him to propose to her, she removed his right of free choice to continue his line. Indicate your vote, red for guilty, gold for innocent."There were several who emitted gold sparks, but not nearly enough to allow the Matron of the Weasley family to go free."The traditional sentence is Azkaban for life. Again indicate your decision, this time red for Azkaban, gold for another punishment which will be debated later."Again the red sparks were presented.Amelia banged her gavel. "Life in Azkaban." She proclaimed and Molly's chair sank into the floor leaving her three youngest children awaiting their fate."The twins have admitted their guilt and expressed regret, yet their crime is severe and three girls were victimized by their actions. Gold for innocent, and red for guilty."This time the sparks were fairly close, actually requiring a tally, which was magically collected to be called out. "Guilty by under ten votes, this will moderate their sentence, which is typically ten years in Azkaban down to three." Amelia said and banged her gavel causing the twins to sink into the floor."Ronald Weasley is accused of attempted rape of the heir of an Ancient house, but is clearly delusional as to his rights. I move that the accused be placed under the care of St. Mungo's at this time. We shall re-address this decision when we have their evaluation." Amelia said.It took a minute, but Marlene seconded the motion when no one else spoke up. She felt Harry would agree that his one-time friend had something wrong with his mind. And even the magical world realized that punishing the insane benefited no one.The vote was taken and Ronald vanished to be taken to St. Mungo's under guard."Members of the Wizengamot." Dumbledore said, once again standing in the Minister's box. "Now that this is behind us, I must inform you that I will not seek to lead this body, nor this nation. My place is ensuring the safety of our society and running my beloved school. Yet I charge all of you to remember that our society will only survive by working together. I shall do my utmost to avoid the scenario of the last war, and a strong Minister will go a long way towards that."Everyone looked at where Fudge sat cringing. When he failed to respond Amelia banged her gavel. "This session of the Wizengamot is declared over. Next full session is on September 3rd at noon in our usual chambers."It took well over an hour for the well-wishers to each speak with Dumbledore and exit the chamber. The Minister had scrambled from the box as soon as the wards shimmered and vanished.Marlene was surprised when her sister met her on the stairs down from her box. "Celeste?""Over here a moment." She said and stepped into a vacant box, pulling Astoria along with her. Lord Greengrass was still speaking with other families of the Grey on the other side of the chamber."Yes?""Astoria would like to speak with you." Her sister said and took a step back, pushing the teen forward."Aunt M." Astoria said a bit too softly to be heard over the conversations in the chamber. She quickly realized that and repeated herself, stepping even closer to her aunt. "Aunt M. When can I visit Daph?""Oh." Marlene said and quickly made a decision. "How about tomorrow starting at lunch, you can stay for a few days, but we're very busy.""Yes." Astoria said and hugged Marlene, though she did it carefully so as not to harm either of their fancy clothes."Here, let me make you a portkey to the front porch." Marlene said and took out her wand."Use this." Celeste said, holding out a foot long piece of delicate lace.Marlene, out of habit, cast a strong finite on the lace before taking it from her sister's hand. "Portus." She incanted, tapping one of the roses along the border of the lace.Astoria gratefully took the lace and folded it into her pocket.Marlene leaned down to her niece's ear. "It will only work for you. Hold it and say, Daph is the bestest."Astoria giggled and covered her mouth with her hands."Tomorrow at eleven, we'll be waiting for you before we begin lunch." Marlene said aloud for her sister to hear. "Pack for three days. Is that alright Cele?""Yes, thank you." Celeste said and squeezed her sister's hand before pulling Astoria back onto the stairs to join Malcolm where he waited near the exit.At last Dumbledore was left with Madam Bones, Marlene, and Mrs. Norwood, while her team replaced the Aurors at the doors."Why have you not acted so decisively in the past?" Marlene said sharply to Dumbledore. Her wand suddenly flashing around them to encase them in a privacy ward."I'm unsure if I shall ever do so again." He said, suddenly looking far frailer than a moment ago as he leaned onto his staff.Fawkes flamed in and alit on his shoulder, instead of adding more weight to the ancient man's frame he seemed to relieve much of it."What's wrong with you Albus?" Madam Bones said."I have been projecting my magical aura since I arrived in this chamber. It's a trick I learned long ago. Alas it is very taxing on one's reserves. It was critical that the Wizengamot, whether they stand for Light, Grey or Dark, to see my power."He paused and stood a bit straighter. "We all must diminish and move on to the next adventure. Poppy says I should allow others to take some of my responsibilities and focus myself where I can do the most good. This was necessary to ensure Lord Potter's position. And I'm certain all of you will agree that he is my logical successor.""At some point in the future my firstborn son may contest that statement, but I shall not." Marlene said.For centuries the title had been passed among only a few of the families. Albus and his brother were the last of their line, neither had produced any heirs, so the title would pass to one of the other Light families. McKinnon and Potter were the only ones that currently were capable of taking it up.Dumbledore chuckled and met her eyes. "And that is a discussion for a son and his father."The women looked at him, not in confusion, but at the ancient man's audacity to bring the subject up."Albus!" Marlene said sharply."Come Lady McKinnon." He said softly. "I see magic as well now as I did in my youth. Lord Potter will father your children or no one shall."With great effort the tall, elegant woman controlled herself. "This is a private matter.""Of course." He said, without even a hint of shame.Valerie hugged Marlene tightly and then pulled back. "I'm so happy for you." She said with a broad smile."Magic has declared him an adult." Madam Bones said. "I'll not stand in the way of magic. You'll hear no protests from me or my office. How long do you have?" she asked, turning to Albus.Dumbledore shrugged. "There is nothing actively killing me, though I anticipate having to face a certain Dark Lord in the near future. I hope to be able to best him and either contain or slay him, but nothing is certain."When none of the witches spoke up he leaned his staff towards Marlene to get her attention. "I find myself in need of a Defense instructor for the coming year. Would you be willing to accept such a post?"Marlene looked to her boss."You're free to do as you wish Lady McKinnon. Your own family honor has dictated your only responsibility and it would seem the best place to perform it." Amelia said quickly."I'm not sure if this is a good idea." Marlene finally said to Dumbledore."But you need a valid reason to be close to Lord Potter, this will provide it. With you taking up the Defense position it will show the world that we're serious about stopping the evil among us." Dumbledore said. "He and his ladies will have their own chambers, as you will. No one else needs to know if they are connected.""And if I find some of that evil within the walls?" Marlene asked, ignoring Dumbledore's attempt to provoke her."Then do as your office, and honor, dictate." He said after a moment's hesitation."Very well. Dumbledore, I'll accept. Though I'll need to bring an assistant along from my castle and he will need his own, disconnected, chamber."Dumbledore bowed to her and vanished in a ball of phoenix fire with a smile on his face."That man." Marlene said as though cursing under her breath.Valerie laughed and put a gentle hand on her friends shoulder. "Is worth his every eccentricity to have standing with us."Marlene sighed and nodded."Go." Madam Bones said. "I'm sure your magic wishes you elsewhere."With an exasperated look, The Spear of the Light, finally let out a soft laugh. "Yes. Yes it does." They didn't answer as she broke her silencing ward and strode down the stairs towards the main entrance."If we make it through the next few years, they'll change the world." Amelia said."They'll change it regardless of our presence, though I intend to ensure we do see it. Let's get you back to your own guard so my team can relax a bit.""I'll have you know I'm familiar with the uses of a wand in combat." Amelia said without any anger as they went down the stairs.Valerie signaled her team and those farthest away hurried down to meet them at the main entrance. "And we both know that the Light cannot afford to lose you."Amelia laughed, "Since my death would see you as the next head of this department, I'll ignore that.""But you'll walk with us to your office.""I shall." Amelia said and they both laughed.}-{The citizens of the mixed village of Godric's Hollow were broken from their routine when the ground shook. Bathilda Bagshot was one of those citizens and she hurried to don her coat and slippers before stepping onto her porch.People were screaming and things were flying through the sky. Her reduced vision didn't enable her to discern if the things in the air were people or pieces of homes, but the three giants were easy enough to identify, though much of that came from when one of them bellowed loud enough to be heard half-way to London. She scurried back inside, not bothering with the door and headed for the floo to notify the authorities.Something struck her home before she made it and she was knocked unconscious. When she woke there was blood on the ground under her left side and a shard of wood through that arm, but people were still screaming so she crawled through the remains of her home to the floo. She was having a hard time breathing for all the dust in the air. At least that was what she told herself, though she realized she perhaps had a few broken ribs from her fall.It took her several minutes to locate the jar of powder as it had been knocked to the floor. It was then she realized the fire had gone out.Dropping the pinch of powder to the hearth she took her wand from her pocket, but the tip dangled loosely, connected only by the sinew of a dragon's heart. With a soft clack it joined the pinch of powder on the hearth.The world grew dark around her as she tried to light the fire with a wandless spell, though she hadn't cast one in nearly a century.The last thing she heard was a guttural voice scream, "Morsmordre!"

Chapter 22 Marlene arrived in the parlor of Black Manor to the smell of lunch. Her tension vanished when she heard Harry laughing from the dining room. She'd been aware of the growing pressure since he'd left the courtroom.This entire scenario was insane and she really should be fighting their magical attraction much harder, but she was too torn as to just what to do. She'd given up on having children when she was sixteen, when her father had been slain by Voldemort to be precise. Since that moment she'd dedicated herself to stopping the evil he represented.Harry came running into the parlor a moment later, broad grin plastered across his face. Hermione was close behind him while Daphne was still rising from the table in the background.He surprised her by picking her up and spinning her around. She didn't laugh, she was far too controlled for that, but her arms did go around him as he let her down and her mouth found his before he could initiate a kiss.Her magic settled immediately and Harry groaned into her mouth as his hands crushed her pelvis against his.Hermione joined them in a suddenly too-intimate hug for Marlene who pulled back."Aunt M." Daphne said in greeting. She stood in the doorway to the dining room, perfectly composed, unlike the other members of her trio. "So the wards tell me you're unharmed, but that was a very long meeting. Now if my lovers can't control them—""No." Harry said, interrupting her. "I'm sorry Daph, but this isn't about control. It's time. Marlene, Lady McKinnon, I don't know the proper form for this so I'll just spit it out. Will you accept me as your Consort from this moment forth? I shall honor you as highly as either of my ladies, but my magic demands this be resolved among us."Ginny squeaked, having just stepped into the room as his magic surged with his statement. She ducked behind Daphne as though seeking shelter, and that did seem to help as she visibly relaxed while the rest of them stood still as statues for a moment."Harry." Marlene said, twisting in place for a moment, but not immediately giving him the answer he desired."I don't care that you're older than I am. I don't care what the world says about it. What I do care about is the opinion of my ladies, and they've both agreed." He paused and took a deep, calming breath letting his Occlumency help him focus. "Regardless of your choice, we'll never abandon you. Our families have been tied together since the founding of this world and I shall not be the end of that. I swear we shall assist you to the bitter end, should it come to that I would be honored to die fighting beside you.""Yes." She heard, and for a moment she thought she'd actually spoken before realizing it was her niece's so familiar voice.Daphne moved beside her in a quick, fluid, motion and took her hand. "You are more concerned as to my feelings, and that's wrong." She caressed her aunt's smooth cheek with a delicate brush of her fingers. "I've loved you for years."Marlene's heart clenched and she froze, this was what she'd been stuck on she suddenly realized. Not her feelings for Harry, but that Daphne was already his lover."It was because of what I felt for you that I knew what was happening when I fell in love with Mine. We're all meant to be together Lene. Do not push us away. You can find love, you HAVE found love, accept it."Marlene opened her mouth to answer Daphne, she wasn't sure what she would say, but she had to reply to that. Daphne pressed a too-gentle kiss upon her lips, then did it again with a bit more force before gently tugging her aunt's lower lip with her teeth and pulling away. Their eyes remained locked and Marlene could clearly see the sincerity in them."Woah," Harry said into the silence, while the two beautiful blonde's stood looking into one another's eyes. "Tell me that was as hot for you as it was for me?" He asked Hermione, who stood with her shoulder pressed into his.Marlene understood what had happened, and was still in shock about it, yet the actual experience had been enjoyable. No wonder Daphne and Hermione seemed so happy with one another.The brilliant brunette nodded, licking her lips. "Yep!" She said with emphasis on the p, her eyes never leaving the entwined women. "That they're both immaculately dressed and elegant as any movie starlet certainly adds to the experience, doesn't it?" She turned to look at him, "And the way they both blush across the side of their neck makes me want to give them hickyes.""Marlene?" He asked, causing them to break their stare and turn their heads to look at him. "Yes, or no?""Yes." She breathed with a gentle smile. "Thank you." She looked back to Daphne, in for a pound and all that, and pressed another kiss to niece's eager lips before speaking again. "And you my little imp. Are not little any more, but you are still impish!"Daphne grinned at the old conversation. "One cannot change their nature, merely learn to use its strength and avoid its weakness."Marlene laughed at the old rejoinder and they separated, she sat on the long couch. The others joined her of course, and then she spotted Ginny standing in the parlor door. "And you," she said warmly crooking a finger to the ginger. "Come here and have a seat, we're going to talk a bit and you need to hear much of it.""Um." Ginny said and then moved to the smaller couch nearest them."So what happened after we left?" Hermione asked.That sobered Marlene in an instant, instead of answering she stood and sat beside Ginny, putting her arm around the suddenly tense girl."We held your families trial." She informed the Potter Ward with a gentle squeeze of her arm.Hermione seemed to apparate to Ginny's other side, pulling the suddenly crying girl into her arms.Harry looked like he wanted to move, but with both sides of the girl covered that only left more intimate positions that he wanted to avoid. Instead he tightened his hold on Daphne's hand and waited.It was the lady to his left who spoke up when Ginny seemed to have calmed. "Tell us what happened so we can help Gin."Marlene blinked at her and then nodded, the direct approach had always worked for them in the past. "Molly was sentenced to Life in Azkaban, the twins three years each, while Ronald is heading to St Mungo's for a mental evaluation and a re-assessment after that."The group sat in silence for nearly a minute before Harry cleared his throat. "Honestly that sounds rather fair of them. For a body that accused me of something I didn't do I expected something more radical.""Yes." Marlene nodded. "The difference was all Dumbledore. He played the court like the master he is.""What about the rest of my brothers and dad?" Ginny asked, deep in Hermione's embrace."Your father is in the potions ward of St. Mungo's, he is not responding well to the treatment to purge thirty years of potions from his system.""So why don't they keep him on it?" Hermione asked. "I mean if he's not responding that should keep him stable."Marlene shook her head. "He's the head of an ancient house, now that they know about this he has to be free of it…" She trailed off and then took Ginny's hand before adding, "or die in the process."Ginny gulped and nodded, "Bill?""William was injured being brought in for questioning. His mind has been damaged, and they're not sure if he will recover. He's unconscious and not in pain.""Who did it?" Harry snarled."I don't have the whole story so I won't tell you my guess." She said and her expression grew grim. "But when I have confirmation we will deal with it.""Thank you." Ginny said."Charlie and Percy?" Harry asked after they'd all thought for a moment."Charlie is the acting head of the family. He's been recalled to meet with Gringotts, tomorrow or the day after." She shrugged. "I heard that from Madam Longbottom during the recess, before the actual trial mind you. Percy was being a prat at the trial, as they saw."She turned back to Ginny to explain what the rest of them had seen. "He tried to insist on Harry being magically restrained and Daphne removed.""No!" Ginny said. "I'll get him with the curse of the bogies!""Valerie Norwood, one of my Co-Hit Witches, put him, and Madam Umbridge in their place. Though Daphne, literally had a hand in that one too.""The cow." Daphne muttered as Harry embraced her, pressing a light kiss to her temple.Marlene cleared her throat. "On another topic, Astoria will arrive via portkey tomorrow about eleven, for a three day stay.""Thank you." Daphne said."I'd like to see Charlie, visit Bill in St. Mungo's, and invite Luna. If that's not too much." Ginny said."Yes." Harry answered. "I'd like to speak with Charlie myself.""We'll go write a letter to Luna next Gin." Hermione said from beside her, having released the younger girl as she grew less terrified."Yes, thanks." She said."Marlene, can you explain just why Dumbledore hasn't taken over like that before?" Hermione asked with a puzzled look on her face.She wanted to shrug, instead she looked at Ginny a moment before replying to the question. She still had to tell them about her parentage. With a quick breath she addressed her answer to Harry. "I talked to him afterwards, with Madam Bones and Valerie. He's actually giving up his responsibilities, except Hogwarts. He said that his performance was required to ensure you succeeded him as the Leader of the Light. When he relaxed, after everyone else left, it did seem to take a lot out of him.""He…" Harry started but trailed off in thought."Is he dying?" Daphne asked."He said nothing was killing him, except his age and, well Tom Riddle." Marlene said and shrugged. "So, I've got one more thing to discuss."Her hand found Ginny's yet again, without looking. "And it's about Ginevra.""What?" She asked sharply, having thought her troubles were over for the moment."When William was injured they had a mind healer go into his memories, trying to repair the damage done when he was attacked. Since he works for Gringotts there are only a few that are certified to do that to him. She, the mind healer, found several memories that had been erased so she repaired them."When she stopped no one said a word."Arthur is not your father, William is.""Merlin." Daphne said in the silence that caused."How…" Ginny started then shook her head violently. "No, I don't want to know how or even why.""Actually you do need to know the why." Marlene said."Why?" Harry asked when no one else seemed inclined to."Your mother was trying to resurrect the Prewett house. The head can only be a male who is more than half Prewett. It's a weird rule, but no one ever said our world made much sense.""But I'm a girl."Daphne snapped her fingers. "Got it. Since your mother was full Prewett, and your father was half, magic will consider you full yourself. So long as the father of your child has some Prewett blood in him, and there are quiet a few if you really look, you our first born son will become Lord Prewett. As Lene's will become Lord McKinnon."Ginny just blinked and for a moment looked happy, but then went pale. Harry just managed to conjure a bucket for her to hurl into in time.When everything was cleaned up, and Ginny was sipping some soda-water courtesy of Kreacher, Marlene told them the rest. "You're thinking everyone will hear about this tomorrow, they won't. Dumbledore bound everyone in the chamber, except me, to not reveal it unless you choose to." She said pointing at Ginny."Thank Dumbledore!" Ginny breathed, coining a possible new term for the Warlock.That caused Harry and Hermione to chuckle. "I haven't gotten used to swearing by Merlin yet and now you've invented another one." Harry said with a gentle smile."Well, it just happens sometimes." She said with a pretty blush.Hermione ran her fingers through Ginny's hair. "Let's go get you cleaned up. We still have that letter to write.""What about lunch?" Marlene asked. "I need to change first though.""Lunch be waiting Lady." Kreacher said from the side of the room."Thank you." Marlene said and then Harry was standing in front of her."What's next for us?" He asked simply."Well first I need to give you that ring, but it's in the family vault." She stopped abruptly, looking fairly pale herself."Marlene," Hermione said firmly. "Just what is in your vault that both the goblin's and you are afraid of?""My father." She said and walked up the stairs to her room.}-{"What do you think Lady McKinnon meant?" Ginny asked.After the stunning statement, which the witch in question refused to elaborate on, they had lunch and then separated to accomplish their own tasks."I think we'll find that out tomorrow afternoon." Hermione said. "I've found with both her and Daph it's not worth pursuing if they want to keep it a surprise. Obviously it is something that Marlene has avoided for some reason, and that the goblins are worried about. That doesn't give much to speculate on, so I'm trying not to. Now are you done with your letter?""Mostly, When should I ask her to come and how long can she stay?""Do you want her here with Astoria or after? How do they get along?"Ginny shrugged. "Well they don't fight, but Luna would only fight if she was afraid for her life, and Astoria is very controlled, like her sister.""I assure you Daph is far from controlled." Hermione said and then covered her mouth with her hand. "Sorry." She said, looking anywhere but at the surprised ginger.Ginny laughed and patted her leg, then whooped in glee. "It's not often you slip up, that was funny.""Yes, well." Hermione said, shifting nervously on the girl's bed. "I know you're curious, Daphne told me about your conversation with her, but I thought she gave you a satisfying answer."Ginny lost her smile. "She gave me a bloody scary answer.""Oh, well yes I can see that. But to me it's like being in the best place ever. When Harry's magic flared earlier, you stepped back, but to Daph and I it was better than the finest chocolate in a relaxing bath. Have you ever felt like that about anyone? Just being near them made you happy or content?"She bit her lip in thought and then tapped her nose with her quill. She almost said something twice and then her eyes went wide. "Bill." She breathed out.Hermione nodded, "You once told me he was your best and favorite brother, and when he left, you got sad. It makes sense, your magic was telling you that he was your father. I bet he felt something similar. Now, when you feel romantically for someone, it might remind you of that. Regardless your magic will draw you together with them."Ginny looked rather depressed for a few minutes, Hermione let her think through her feelings without interrupting. Being with Daph had taught her that bit of wisdom. Eventually she nodded, "Yes, thanks. I think Luna should arrive about when Astoria is leaving, share one day maybe? I know we haven't got a lot of time before school starts up.""Sure, and tell her she can stay for three days, just like Astoria."Ginny went back to writing but asked another question without looking up. "How are we getting this to her?" She suddenly looked up, "And how is she getting here?""Well Hedwig's been looking rather bored. So that answers your first question. And once we have a reply we'll ask Marlene to make her a portkey. She can deliver it or we'll ask Kreacher to do that."}-{"Ginny?" Marlene called through her door."Miss McKinnon?" Ginny said and hurried to open her door."Hermione mentioned you'd like to see Bill in St. Mungo's. I can take you, if you like." The tall woman said gently."Um, yeah." Ginny said. "Can I talk to Hermione a minute?""Certainly dear. I'm not going to drag you down there, but it's still early enough in the day and I've got the clearance to get you through the security around him.""OK, thank you. Do you know where she is?""Well there are two places to find her around here, the library or their suite. Personally I usually try the library first." Marlene said with a laugh."Yeah," Ginny said with a blush and went downstairs to the Black family library. She found all three of them there. Hermione was meditating while Daphne read a book and Harry was searching the stacks for something."Hello." Harry said, noticing her first. "Are you alright?" he asked, glancing behind her were Marlene was coming down the stairs."Sort of." Ginny said. "Miss McKinnon asked if I wanted to go see Bill now. Is that ok? Do any of you want to go too?""We'll go if you want us." Harry said simply. "He's your family, but if you want some privacy, usually it's best to not be seen with me. I tend to attract it.""Gin, Aunt M. will keep you safe. But if you want us, we will go with you." Daphne said, putting her book flat on the table."No, I didn't want to make this a big journey. Just wanted to make sure none of you wanted to go before we vanish and then someone says they'd have liked to have gone." Ginny said, the words rushing from her."Relax." Marlene said, putting a protective hand on the ginger's shoulder. "What's the matter?" she said, sitting in the nearest chair and moving her hands to lightly touch Ginny's hips.Ginny fidgeted a minute before answering with a shrug. "I guess, I'm nervous." She took a slow but deep breath. "Alright, let's go see my father, the real one." She added with a very serious expression.Marlene nodded. "Two hours at most, more likely one." She said to Harry, while Ginny took her hand and they walked out of the library.The apparition to St. Mungo's was over before she realized it had begun. If there was nothing else about Marlene McKinnon that awed her, her ability to side-along apparate as though taking a step through a door was certainly a sign of her power.Ginny suddenly realized she was holding the Hit Witch's left hand, which kept her right hand free to use her wand and defend them. She hadn't noticed it back in the house, but now that others were around she saw how Marlene seemed aware of everyone at once.Instead of speaking to the nurse at the main desk they walked over to the side where an Auror stood. He'd jumped to his feet when they arrived, and spilled his coffee on the floor behind him."Lady McKinnon." The man said and quickly passed two silver badges to her.She handed one to Ginny and pressed the other to the collar of her cloak. "Ginevra Weasley, to see William Weasley and possibly Arthur Weasley as well.""Yes." He said and wrote their names on a ledger.Ginny looked at the badge. 'Restricted, no escort required.' It said in bold letters outlined in red. She pressed it to her collar as she'd seen Marlene do and it stuck in place.Now they went back through the lobby and to the lifts, stepping into the first to arrive, after a pair of old men exited it. The lift rose and Marlene pressed her wand to a rune, preventing the door from opening."Did you want to see Arthur too?" She asked when Ginny looked up at her."I… No. Oh, well, yes I guess I would like to see him too." Ginny stammered through her thoughts as they came."I thought so. After Bill." She said and let go of the rune. The door slid open and she stepped out, wand still in hand.Ginny followed, holding tightly to Marlene's left hand. There were two Aurors in front of a door, they looked at them suspiciously for a moment and then recognized her and their mood changed to sadness, nearly making Ginny cry."He's not awake Madam." One of them said to Marlene."We're aware Jackson. She wants to see her big brother." Marlene said in a surprisingly friendly voice.The man nodded. "Sure." He said while his partner pulled the door open for them.And there was big strong, ever-in-motion Bill Weasley. Yet it wasn't him at all, just the husk he walked around in. The first detail she noticed was that he was bald, why was he bald?"He was hit in the head." Marlene said softly causing Ginny to whirl around. The door was closed and Marlene was sitting beside it in a chair."How long was I standing there staring?""About five minutes. You asked why he was bald. Since he was hit in the back of the head they vanished his hair. It will grow back, but they needed it out of the way while they healed him.""But his mind isn't working?""No, at least not enough for him to wake up.""Is there anything we can do?" Ginny asked."I could drag you into his mind with me, but I'd like at least one more person in the room we trust. We wouldn't be aware of what's happening while we were doing it. And I'm not sure if we could do any good."She pulled Ginny closer, so she was standing between Marlene's knees. "Your magic might do him more good than anything. His will know who you are." She whispered. "Go talk to him, hold his hand and call him.""I don't know if I can do that." She said.Marlene nodded and gave her a smile. "Of course you can." She didn't wait for a response, merely took Ginny's shoulders and spun her to face her real father before letting go of her.Ginny's own feet seemed to move against her will. She wanted to go slowly, but they took big steps, putting her beside Bill's head in a mere three steps. Then her hand got into the rebellion and grabbed Bill's as it lay on the sheets."Bill?" her voice cracked. She coughed and then tried again. "Bill?" then leaning close to his ear. "Dad? I know the truth now. I love you." She whispered.Then she couldn't see clearly as she put her forehead on his shoulder and cried.}-{"Mrs. Norwood?" Katie asked when she heard the door open."Yes." Came the reply before she made it around the partition and became visible to the teenaged girl. "I'm back. Sorry, the Wizengamot took a long time to wrap up."Katie sat up in her bed, finally wearing normal clothes again as she was being discharged. "So where are we going?""I live at Castle McKinnon. You're coming there with me, unless that's unacceptable to you?" Valerie said, coming close beside the bed and sitting in one of the chairs."Really? That's not a myth?""No," Valerie said shaking her head. "Quite a few of us live there. My husband, children and I live in our own suite. I can put you up in one of my guest rooms."Katie grew pensive, shifting the sheets beside her before looking up. "I'd like to meet him.""Who?""Charlie Weasley. The man I've been designed for." Katie answered gesturing to her pelvis. "They can't fix me. I heard them talking, pitying me, saying I'll never enjoy sex with a normal man, much less him getting anything out of it."Valerie winced, damn insensitive healers. "Why do you want to meet him?""I saw him at Hogwarts when he was there for the tournament. He seemed ok, and he wasn't involved in any of this right?""Nothing I've learned gave me any indication he knew what was going on. He's lived in Romania since the summer after he graduated. I had one of my colleagues, in Romania, question him under Veritaserum. He is innocent.""Will he be coming here because of this?""Yes." Valerie said. "He's now the acting head of the family. He's got to meet with Gringotts and sign some papers for the Ministry.""Can I come with you? I assume you're going to see him.""Kate." Valerie said, standing and taking the girl's hand. "I don't want you to make any quick decisions, and remember, I'm now your magical guardian."Kate's eyes went wide and she shook her head. "I'm not… No.""What?""I'm not going to mention any of this." She said, her voice higher than usual, gesturing with her free hand towards her pelvis. "I just want to meet him, nothing more."Valerie looked into her eyes for nearly a minute before she slowly nodded. "Good, because even with your modifications there are plenty of men in the world that would qualify. Don't let this define who you are.""No, I'm going to be a professional Quidditch player." Kate said with a lopsided grin, which suddenly became a frown. "Though the girls aren't likely to recover in time for school."The Hit Witch pulled the teenager into a gentle hug. "They'll recover, though it will take more than a month to get the lust potion out of their systems.""But they'll have to come to terms with what happened, like I did. I got fucked by a ghoul. I don't want to come anywhere near sex for at least a few years."Valerie pulled back from the hug and looked into Kate's wet eyes. "Sometimes we are not in control and things happen, dark wizards prey on the weak. You're going to be just fine Katie Bell. No one at school should know what happened. All of the records are sealed.""So? I should expect everyone to know." Kate said with a rough laugh. "I'm not afraid of that. I don't have a boyfriend to get jealous, I'm a Gryffindor and we charge forward."Valerie found herself laughing along with her new charge. Yes Katie Bell would overcome this and move on with her life. Now she wondered if the other girls would be able to do the same when their chance came. The only thing she could do was ensure they got that opportunity."You are a silly girl. My daughter, Vickie, will love you." Valerie said. "Now, come on let's blow this Popsicle stand."}-{Ginny had soaked Bill's gown with her tears. She didn't know what she'd said or remember much of the last hour, except Lady McKinnon had waited patiently and Bill hadn't done anything to indicate he was waking."Would you still like to see Arthur?" she asked gently once Ginny had recovered. Several quick motions with the Hit-Witch's wand and her makeup was restored.She poured herself a glass of water from the pitcher waiting in the corner and sipped it slowly while she thought. Finally she put the glass down and gave Bill's hand one more squeeze. "No." she said and walked to the door. "Let's go home."Marlene nodded and canceled the locking spell she'd placed on the door.Walking past the room was Katie Bell! "Katie!" Ginny called and swiftly stepped into the hall.The brunette Gryffindor chaser turned in a fluid motion, her expression guarded. She waited for Ginny to step closer before putting her arms out.Ginny leapt into the older girl's arms and they hugged intently for about thirty seconds before Marlene and Valerie tapped their charges on the shoulder."Katie is moving in with me." Valerie said to Marlene. "My guest room.""And she is most welcome in my home." Marlene said gently, looking down at Katie who appeared shocked."She's cool." Ginny said, stepping back and taking Marlene's left hand gently. "I'll see you around Katie.""Yes, sure." Katie added while Valerie put a hand on her shoulder.Together the four of them headed down in the lift, the teens not sure what to say and the adults long accustomed to one another's silence.
