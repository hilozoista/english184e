This is my first FF and the first time I would write something, but I've read a lot of fics. Constructive criticism is welcome. And this has been beta'd by Thegirlwhocouldopenflowers. Oh, I don't own anything.Summary: When Draco Malfoy finds himself surrounded by friends who are beginning to settle down, he is faced with the possibility of finding his true love. It all comes down to one name: Hermione, his ex-girlfriend whom he had the best memory with. They were a perfect couple until one mishap led them to fall apart. It must be fate then when he sees her once again after a year and a half.Chapter One"According to the census, there are 9 million people in London. How will you know if you've found the one for you? Maybe you've seen him already, but you bent down to tie your shoelace. Maybe he was already beside you but you looked to another direction to see the traffic lights. Maybe you've already crossed each other's paths but the cab blocked your way. There are some people who were lucky to find the one for them. There are some, who are still searching and some who have given up. But the worst part is, he's yours already but you let him slip away." he said while looking deeply in the eyes of the woman in front of him. "But, what if, you were only given one chance to meet the one? Will you miss your chance…even if it's in front of you already?"She has been batting her lashes the moment he spoke. "So, how many boxes do you want?"She sighed. "Everything."Draco smirked and stood up. All of his employees applauded. "See? That's how you make a sale. You grab your chance while it's still in front of you because you only have one chance in your life. And of course, don't forget to use your charms and looks." His phone rang. He knew who it was so he rushed out his office.It was the 14th of February, the Muggles celebrated what they call Valentine's Day. It was the day of love, obviously. This is the day where they choose to spend time with their specific someone or just ignore this day and stay at home. But as for a famous bachelor, say, Draco Malfoy, he could be spending tons of galleons on clubs and partyin' all night with the prettiest ladies who are willing to throw themselves at him.It could be his activity right now but it wasn't... He was at a wedding.oOoOoOoDraco felt someone nudge him on his arm. "Hey, Draco, go and dance with Pansy." Marcus Flint cocked his head to where Pansy was. "She has been waiting for you to dance with her. Don't keep the bride waiting." Marcus wiggled his brows while Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.Draco glared at the three and cursed under his breath. He glanced to his right and found Theo grinning. "Sod off." he grunted. He stood up slowly and took a glass of champagne from the waiter who was serving drinks at the table next to them, drinking it down in one swift.Not strong enough. He needed scotch.He was dragging himself on the dance floor when Pansy turned around and immediately saw Draco on his way. She beamed at him, leaving the old man she was dancing with before.He smirked and held out his hand. She accepted it gladly."Are you happy Draco?" she asked."Of course I am." He spun her around."Well I could see how ecstatic you are." she replied sarcastically.Draco rolled his eyes. "I am happy for you, Pansy. I just don't like weddings. You know that."Pansy gave a small smile. "Sorry. I know how allergic you are to weddings." she placed her palm on his cheek, "Thank you, you know. You still came even if you despise this kind of occasion."He spun her once more when he felt someone tap his shoulder. "Mind if I dance with my wife?"He turned around and saw his best friend Blaise Zabini. He held his hands up as if in surrender. "Hey mate, she's all yours."Blaise chuckled and took Pansy's hand. They were about to start to dance when Draco came back. "Thank you Blaise- you know- for saving my feet. And may I remind you to be careful. Pansy here -" he cocked his head to the side "- has two left feet. Been stepping my foot the whole bloody time. Felt like a mountain troll danced on it. No wonder why these chaps stayed on their seats at the corner."Blaise couldn't control his laughter while Pansy was glaring at him. She was about to say something inappropriate but Draco flee quickly, whistling on his way back to his safe little seat.Once seated, the light started to dim and only a spotlight focused on the married couple. It was time for their wedding dance.A soft melodic tune began. Draco assumed it was Pansy's idea because Blaise wouldn't pick that kind of song. Pansy was still glaring at Blaise but he whispered something on her ear. She playfully rolled her eyes and slapped him gently on his shoulder. And in an instant they were both smiles again, her leaning her head on his chest.They sure loved each other.Now that's what Draco wanted. He wanted a real relationship, true love, how everybody calls it. He wanted to experience this deep, mad, crazy love thing the Muggles call.He included himself as one of the unlucky ones.oOoOoOoThe reception went on until all of the guests were leaving, which means the only people left were the gang (Draco, Blaise, Marcus, Goyle and Theo). Crabbe had left earlier with his wife, Millicent Bullstrode. They were all seated in one table drinking their scotch. Pansy had to go inside their Manor to rest, being pregnant and all.They were all quiet when Marcus gave Blaise a pat on the back. "Congratulations, 'Mate. I know I've said it a couple of times but, really, I'm happy for you both." He sure was drunk with his groggy voice and hazy eyes. "I have to go now, my fiancé is waiting for me." Marcus stood up and raised his glass and headed towards the floo.When Marcus was out of sight, Goyle placed another swig of scotch on his glass. "I still can't believe Marcus is engaged to that Patil girl. Who is it again? Padma or Parvati?""Parvati." Blaise said.Theo darted his eyes to where Goyle was. "Get over it Goyle, it was a year ago. She'll never be yours."Draco and Blaise snorted.Goyle's cheeks turned slightly pink. "Who said I like her? You guys are crazy." Draco smirked. "So I was right all along, it was Marcus you're after."Goyle balled his fists, stood up and stormed out of the room.Draco sighed in relief. "I thought he would never leave."Theo thought for a moment, "He's gay?"Blaise chuckled. "Honestly, Theo."Theo shrugged. The three men laughed.Draco has been silent for a while, absently staring at his glass. The room fell silent. Then it hit him. The attention was drawn to him now.Bullocks."Hey Drake." Draco glanced at Blaise. "Next time you insult my wife, make sure she's not around. I've almost got myself hexed in my arse in the middle of our first dance."Draco snorted. "Well that was my plan. It could've ended the party earlier and saved us all from this shit." He downed his glass feeling the burn flowing down his throat. He slammed his glass back on the table.This should've insulted Blaise but he knew why his friend was bitter or, like everyone said, "allergic" to weddings.Theo tried to enlighten the conversation. "Hey Draco, I thought you would bring your supermodel girlfriend here?"Draco looked smug. "Ended it." The two men's jaws dropped. She was the hottest model in London. Such a waste. "You should've introduced me to her." Theo muttered.Draco ticked. "You would've ended it too. She is all beauty but no brains, whiny and...clingy." He made a face.Goyle spoke behind them "Seriously Draco, you date every fine woman in this world and they are never enough for you."Blaise raised his brow. "I thought you left."Goyle looked confused. "I just needed to use the loo." He sat again on his seat.Blaise glanced at Draco, "Like that French CEO?" he grinned.Draco waved a lazy hand. "We were similar financially, but she was even more of a workaholic than I am."Theo chuckled. "Yeah, you always ended up talking to answering machines or her gay secretary who kept flirting with you."The look of horror in Draco's face was priceless. There was a burst of laughter in the room."What about that singer?" Goyle inquired. Draco sighed in frustration. "Her voice was beautiful, don't get me wrong, but she would sing all the time, like narrating the things she would do. She even tried to get me to sing-a-long. I stopped myself from giving her the worst hex I could possibly think of."There was another burst of laughter."The picture of you singing was epic." Theo said wiping tears from his eyes.Blaise poured another round of scotch on their glasses. He was enjoying where this conversation was going. "But before all these women –" Blaise began, pouring another round in Theo's glass. "- there was this one woman who truly caught Draco's heart."Two men nodded."You mean the photographer?" Theo said.Goyle furrowed his brow. "I thought she was a writer?"Draco waved his hand. "Oh forget it, if she sees me, she might give me the Avada Kedavra." He stood up and excused himself, making a beeline towards the floo. He took a handfull of floo powder and in a second he was at his flat.He flopped down on the couch and loosened his tie.oOoOoOoMeanwhile back at the Zabini ManorBlaise felt guilty for bringing her up but he knew he did the right thing. Draco should stop himself dating the wrong women just to temporarily fill up the hole in his heart. He knew Draco needed a wakeup call, he had to swallow his pride and get her back.Theo sighed. "He really loved her."Goyle could only nod in agreement.oOoOoOoOnce Draco set foot on his flat, he took his coat off, loosened his tie and slumped on the couch. He pinched the bridge of his nose as he closed his eyes shut.oOoOoOoFlashback (1 year and four months ago)"I don't want to go to this bloody date. I don't even know who you set me up with." Draco said while taking another look at himself in the mirror.Marcus snorted. "Yeah, it seems like you don't want to go to that date. Isn't that right Theo?" Theo just looked at them lazily and went back to the book he was reading. "Right." Marcus muttered."Theo, if you don't tell me who it is- I swear I'll -" Draco turned his head where Theo was and noticed him chuckling quietly. He took his wand and the book went flying across the room. Theo darted his eyes towards him "I was reading that."Draco waved a lazy hand. "You weren't. That was a cook book and I'm sure nothing in there was funny." His eyes grew wide. "Did you set me up with Bullstrode?"Theo shrugged and took another book from the shelf. "I just had a little chat with someone at my office and she said she wanted to set her friend's friend with someone with a passable IQ. So, I said I know someone with a bit of a brain - which is you – but she didn't tell me who was her friend, though."Draco shot him a look."I swear mate. I don't know who it is."Draco grunted. "Well, who is this woman you talked to, if I may ask?"Theo waved a lazy hand. "It doesn't matter. I don't think you know her anyway."Marcus stood up and headed towards the floo. "I'm sorry children, but I have plans tonight. Miss Parvati Patil just owled me and she seems to be in need of company."Before they could say anything, Flint was swallowed by large green flames.Draco smirked and checked himself again in the mirror. "As long as she's a woman – you're not setting me up with a guy, right?"Theo shook his head chuckling. "No, why would I do that?" Draco raised his brow. He sighed. "Look, all I know is that your date is a woman. Just go and have fun. You could always end the date if you don't like her."Draco thought for a minute. Yeah, he could just ditch his date if he wanted to. He ditched a lot of women before, why would he not do it now? That made him feel better. He glanced back to fish more information from Theo but he found out that he was alone in his room. He frowned.He apparated to a small dark alley. As a Malfoy, or any upper-class men, he has access to any places he wanted to go to. Since the paparazzi were following his every move, he seldomly entered through the grand entrance and red carpets. He felt better sneaking at the back of restaurants or hotels, if you get the picture.He looked around and muttered a password. The door opened and he was greeted by the manager of the restaurant. "Good evening, Sir." He led Draco further inside."Has my date arrived?""Yes, Sir. She arrived much earlier than expected."Draco stopped midway. "Really? What does she look like? It's a she, isn't it?"The manager, whose name is Oliver, looked amused. "Uh- Yes, Sir. Your date is a 'she' and she looks stunning."Draco sighed in relief because he was sure it was a woman, but for the stunning part, he wasn't convinced. He didn't trust Oliver's taste in women. This 'woman' might be up to Oliver's expectations, not his. Good thing he reserved a table in the VIP area so that no one could see him and his date.He has a reputation to uphold and he won't just let it shatter now."Oh Sir, I almost forgot, we moved your table…as per request of Sir Nott.""WHAT?" He yelled, glaring at Oliver, who began to sweat."Sir- I- Sir Nott ordered-"He gritted his teeth. "I know Nott owns this fucking place, but I've reserved that table for an amount that could provide you and your family for many generations."Oliver swallowed. "But, Sir Malfoy, Sir Nott said to never let you in that area. He placed every spell possible in all the VIP rooms to block you from entering them."Draco closed his fists, trying to stop himself from hitting the man in front of him. Oliver was a kind old man and it wasn't his fault that his bastard boss changed his reservations. Damn Nott.He made a mental note to kill Nott later, after he refunds his galleons."Is there anything else you forgot to mention?"Oliver thought for a moment. "Oh. Since your table is located at the speed dating event, you would have to participate, as per Sir Theo's orders. But don't worry Sir, I've seen all the ladies out there and they are all beautiful."Draco punched and kicked the air, which concerned Oliver. Draco was mad, scratch that, he was furious. Now he knew why Theo forced him to this 'date'. He might've invited all the unattractive women in the Wizarding World. This must be his payback because Draco had set him up before with a random girl in Spain who turned out to be a guy. Bloody hell.He turned his heel and headed towards the exit until he felt a magical belt on his waist. He closed his eyes. Great.Oliver cleared his throat. "Sir Theo also casted a spell around you so that you couldn't leave until midnight.""Anything else?" Draco growled.Oliver shook his head.Draco darted towards the double doors. He opened it wide and saw a bunch of ladies on the left side and a bunch of men on the right side. He cursed under his breath and looked around for his specific date. The only thing Theo had told him was that she would be wearing a pink ribbon on her wrist. Well, that was "useful". He's been looking at all the ladies wrists...and he was right. They were all wearing it.This bloody event was an ultimate setup. Theo should be digging his grave now.He took a seat at a table by the corner. He noticed that he was wearing a blue ribbon on his wrist like other blokes around. For sure it was Theo's idea. He tried to take it off with every spell he knew but it would only bounce back. He transfigured a scissor and any other sharp objects but it wouldn't even leave a scratch.He thought of the craziest ideas on how to take it off, like say, cut his hand off. 'Till he came with the most brilliant plan he could think of. He would just stay in this safe little corner until midnight. He didn't care if his date would be alone and humiliated. Fuck it to whatever Theo's planning."Hey Draco!" Crabbe waved at him and took a seat beside him. "Man, I didn't know you joined in these kinds of events.""It's because I don't, you idiot." He said through gritted teeth. Of all the people who could be here with him, why did it have to be Crabbe?Crabbe shrugged. "Then why are you here?" Draco sighed and stopped himself from smacking Crabbe's head on the table. It would just cause more damage to his brain, if he even had one. "Oh, I don't know, maybe I was hoping to see some circus clowns here. I guess I was wrong."Crabbe knotted his brows. "Yeah, you're wrong. There are no clowns here Malfoy."Draco ran a hand on his face. "Oh that's right. Only stupid monkeys are here." He meant it for Crabbe. Such a waste of time. He thought.Crabbe thought for a moment. "I don't understand."He snorted. "You never will." He called the waiter and took a glass of champagne."Draco! Crabbe!" both men turned their heads."Hey Goyle! Could you please tell Draco that there are no clowns or monkeys here?"Goyle looked confused and took another chair to join his friends."What is Crabbe talking about?"Draco just shrugged."So, you guys excited?" Goyle asked, eyeing all the beautiful ladies passing by.Crabbe nodded while Draco rolled his eyes. He pitied these two. They were like a couple of drooling dogs who were waiting for a treat."Oh c'mon, Drake. You might find your soulmate here." Goyle waved his hand at a raven haired girl, who only ignored him."This is stupid." Draco muttered."No, it's a great past time." They heard a man speak. Draco cocked his head to the side and saw his best friend, Blaise Zabini. Finally, someone who had a brain.He shook his mate's hand. "Theo set you up too?"Blaise chuckled. "No, only you. I knew about this event.""What about Pansy?"Blaise waved dismissively. "Nah, I don't think it will work out. She's off to Paris for a fashion show. She wants me to come, but I don't want to. So it's either go with her or stay here but we're over.""You keep saying that, maybe someday you two will just tie the knot."Blaise snorted. "Yeah right, me? Getting married? I don't think so."He placed his arm up to get the waiter's attention. They all took a glass of champagne."These ladies are hot." Blaise stated. He pointed at one blonde girl. "What do you think about that?"Crabbe and Goyle nodded. "Yeah." They said in chorus. Draco peered his eyes to where the girl was. "Maybe."Goyle cocked his head to another direction. "How about her?" They saw an amber-haired girl. "Nice." said Crabbe. Blaise and Draco nodded."Hey, that brunette is mine." Blaise pointed to a girl with soft brunette curls. Her back was facing them but they could see her curves with that hugging peach dress that she was wearing. Draco's eyes went from her long curly hair, down to her petite waist and down to her fine legs. He might consider this girl even just for the night. "Sorry Blaise, but that's my date."Blaise scoffed. "How do you know? You don't know who your date is, not to mention what she looks like."Draco downed his glass. "Believe me, I know my date. And that –" he pointed at the girl. "-is her". Blaise just rolled his eyes. "Whatever you say, Malfoy."They were all watching the brunette move. The way she talked to the girls around her and how delicate and small her hands were. She still wasn't facing them, which made Draco even more anxious to meet that girl. They couldn't go over to the other side because there was a magical spell in the middle of the room. They would be able to meet all the ladies when the host said so. The girl turned her head slightly to the side and he saw her cute little nose.An older woman came towards her and gave her a name tag. He narrowed his eyes and was devastated to see what it said. "Event Organizer" he heard his friends say. I think they all heard a glass shatter.Blaise sighed. "Bloody hell. Sorry Draco." he gave him a pat on the back.Goyle ticked. "Such a waste." Crabbe nodded in agreement.Draco ran his hand through his hair. This girl may not be his date, but who cared? He wanted her and he would get her. He stood up. "That name tag wouldn't stop me from meeting her." At that moment the bell rang. The older woman took the microphone and greeted everyone. She announced that the speed dating event would begin.Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle went to the vacant seats and began a casual conversation with some ladies. Draco, however, was still making a beeline towards the brunette. She was at the bar. He felt someone tap his back. "I'm sorry, but you should take a seat now." The old woman pulled him to a seat but he kept glancing on the brunette. He wasn't paying attention to the pretty blonde haired girl in front of him. He wanted to meet that girl on the bar. He glanced on the side and saw Marcus. He sighed in relief. "Hey, Marcus." Marcus looked for the one who was calling him and he spotted Draco waving at him.He went to where Draco was. "Thought you had a date with a Patil."Marcus shook his head. "She had to go to somewhere with her twin sister."Draco smirked. "Then please take my place." Marcus accepted.Draco went to a different direction so that the old woman wouldn't see him. The girl was still at the bar. "Perfect, I could just buy her a drink". She was now in front of him, her back facing him. He cleared his throat but she didn't glance back. He then tapped her shoulder and she turned around.His smile froze and it seemed she had the same reaction. "Malfoy?""G-Granger?"

This would be Hermione's side of the story, also a flashback. I wasn't supposed to write her side of the story, but some of you might be wondering why she was in that speed dating event. I hope you like it. Please review. I don't own anything. Beta'd by ThegirlwhocouldopenflowersChapter Two"Hey Ginny!" she waved at her best friend.Ginny beamed at her and rushed to her direction, pulling her into a tight hug, "It's nice to see you 'Mione." Then she pulled away.Ginny looked at her, like scanning her friend for any dirt or something. "Did you do something to your hair? It looks great. Oh! Cute shoes, are they new?" She continued on and on until Hermione placed a hand before her face to halt her babbling friend."What did you do?" Hermione raised one brow.Ginny sighed "Don't get mad." and bit her lip. Hermione glared at her as her red-haired friend, linked their arms together and pulled her to the coffee shop across the street. As they were walking, Ginny spoke. "I set you up on a blind date."Hermione hung her head. "Not again, Gin. C'mon! All those blokes you've set me up with were daft dimbos."Ginny giggled. "But this is different. Please?" She said while batting her lashes.Hermione rolled her eyes. "Fine, but this is the last one, alright?" Ginny clapped her hands in delight, their arms still linked together.They were almost near their destination when Hermione's curiosity got to her. "So, who's this guy?"Ginny snorted. "I thought you'll never ask. Honestly, I don't know either." Hermione stopped midway which caused Ginny to trip. "What?"Ginny waved a lazy hand. "Katie asked me if I knew anyone who needed a date, so I said yes. She said someone from her work asked her to find a suitable date for his friend. Don't worry. I'm sure he's a handsome young bachelor and he has an IQ level that can compete with that brain of yours."Hermione shook her head. "I don't think I want to go to this date."Ginny sighed. She was tired of going over the same scenarios over and over again. The brightest witch of their age had a very specific description of the guy she wanted to date, a.k.a someone who doesn't exist."Hermione, seriously, stop over thinking. Just go on this bloody date. You've never considered anyone since your break up with –" she made a face "-since Viktor."Hermione couldn't help but giggle. "And that's the reason why I never want to date anyone. Maybe someday, but not now."Ginny nodded. Her friend had been through a very rough time. First, she had obliviated her parents, and she came back after the war, only to find out that they died of a car accident.Hermione added. "Because of my relationship with Viktor, I learned that men are-" she held up her fingers. "- liars, cheaters or just plain idiots... And that just drives me insane. Why would anyone want to date?"Ginny rolled her eyes. "But, Hermione, It's been months now. Viktor was really a douche, but not all men are the same. I know, I've set you up with four dates.""Nine" Hermione corrected."Nine dates-" Ginny muttered. "and I know I've been setting you up with not-okay guys, as you describe them to be. But, give this guy one last chance. He might even change your principle about love." She said the last part in a sultry voice.Hermione grimaced. "I know that I've been having a hard time to find decent guys. Ever since Viktor, I just don't want to be in a relationship. After my parents died, I already hated being alone. Then Viktor even made it worst by leaving me. I just want to find someone who will never leave me…who will be with me for the rest of my life. That's why I just have friends, like you, because I know you would never leave me, right?"Ginny nodded. "But having someone is different, Hermione."Hermione rolled her eyes. "I know. I know someday I'll meet the guy for me. Maybe not now, maybe…""…on that date?" Ginny suggested."Gin." she warned."Hermione." Gin mocked. "Not all men are like Viktor, not all men are liars, cheaters and idiots." Ginny hated repeating things. Her friend was just really stubborn.Hermione shrugged. "Not convinced." She opened the glass door of the coffee shop. The aroma of the coffee and freshly baked pastries surrounded them. They made a bee-line to the counter to choose from the different varieties of pastries on the tray behind the glass. Ginny was still pleading, giving a little pout.Hermione glanced at her and narrowed her eyes. "Fine. But this is the last one, okay?"Ginny pulled her fist in the air and jumped up and down, not minding the curious glances of the muggles surrounding them. Hermione couldn't help but giggle."So when is it?" she asked, pointing at a croissant to the cashier."Tomorrow. The restaurant where Tracy Davis held her birthday party is having this event." Ginny pointed at a strawberry tart. "A speed dating event."Hermione's head snapped back to her friend. "What?" blinking her eyes a few times. What else was her sneaky friend hiding? "I thought you were setting me up with one guy - not with a whole flock of them.""Two café macchiato please." Ginny told the cashier and glanced back to her. "Just go, please? You agreed already. And who are you going to bring at my wedding?"So this is what it is all about? A wedding date? She doesn't need to bring someone on Harry and Gin's wedding. She is happy just the way she is right now. Everything is simple… no dramas, no fights, stress-free and a whole lot of things she could list.Sure, Ron was now married to Lavander. Harry got Gin, Neville got Luna and Dean is getting serious with Padma. Everyone got partners, but she didn't mind being the only "solo girl". Seriously, she was okay. Right? Her brows furrowed, flashbacks of scenes where they would all hang out together and she would always be the one with the book in hand came to her mind. She would pretend she was busy reading a book so that she wouldn't see the sweet couples around her. More and more scenes came to her mind when she felt someone tap her shoulder."'Mione?""Oh, sorry. What did you say?""Our orders are here, let's go sit?"She nodded. "Right."They took their trays and went to their usual seat; the one at the end of the café with a huge glass window on the side giving them an excellent view of the park.When they were both settled, Ginny's eyes darted towards her friend. She knew something was bothering her friend. She knew the break up with Viktor took a toll on her. Hermione wasn't happy. She was just too stubborn to admit it."Mione, this guy will be there. Both of you would just be participating in this event." She took a bite of her strawberry tart. "And besides, if you don't like this guy…then just look for other options. It's like-" she thought for a moment."-trying every fish in the lake. Was that right? The fish-muggle saying?"Hermione grinned. "Sort of" She took a sip in her cup while staring out at the window."How is your book? Is it finished already?" Ginny asked."Almost." She muttered, while taking another sip of her espresso.She was writing a new book about spells. Some of them were the spells they had learned during their study at Hogwarts and the spells she had used while she was with Harry and Ron in search for the Hocruxes. She also added the new spells she had made."Hey, 'Mione, could you take photos at our wedding party? Your photos look really great."Oh, Hermione loved taking picture. She had collected some magazine or newspaper cut-outs of great pictures when she was little. She just loved all the details and how she could see the world from a different point of view. Taking pictures made her feel relaxed and, most importantly, remember the moment. She didn't want to forget all the memories she had, whether it was big or simple events in her life."Sure Gin, I would love to.""You could also teach me how to take great pictures. I could be your photographer on your wedding." Ginny teased.Hermione playfully rolled her eyes. If I ever get married. She continued to glance outside the window.When they were done with their meal, they headed out of the café. Hermione looked at the clear blue sky and sighed out loud. "You know what Gin? I'll go to that date." She glanced at her friend. "I mean, it's just for one night- and I- it's just a date. I shouldn't make a big deal out of it. I could just have fun and just enjoy being single. Share stories, likes and dislikes." She thought for a moment. She was babbling to her friend and all her friend could do was stare at her like she's gone mental. Hermione sighed and nodded. "Yeah, I should stop now."Ginny nodded and linked their arms together. "Just go to that date."Hermione gave a small smile. The truth was, back at the shop she had seen couples spending this wonderful day at the park. She had realized that she wanted that. She wanted to lie down on someone's lap while reading a book. She wanted someone to share a kiss with by the fountain or someone to laugh with. She had to admit that she was unhappy. She was lonely.Sure, she was an intelligent, independent woman, but she had feelings too. She wanted to have a family, not to grow old alone with a bunch of cats and stuffy old books. No. It was time to take things differently.She'd been holding back too much because of Viktor. And she should stop blaming all men for one's mistake, right?If going to this date would give her a man capable of having a decent conversation, great. If not, well- like Ginny said - I could try other fishes in the lake- erm- sea. Whatever.oOoOoOoHermione woke up at seven in the morning. Good thing she was the author of her own book and Luna was her editor. She could have days off and don't rush every chapters. But she didn't slack off just because she could; it just happened that Ginny told Luna about this date. The only person who was nagging her was her publicist. Hermione had been doing spell and potion books. She also wrote a biography of Harry. But she wanted to try something different. She wanted to write a novel. With her great brain, she could write any genre…well, except for romance.She dressed up, wearing a cute yellow sundress. She decided to go shopping. After all, she had to be 'presentable' for this date. Not like it really mattered to her, but she just wanted to make an impression.Her bushy curls were already tamed. They were now wavy with soft curls at the end. She could give credits to her fashionista guru, Padma. Her taste in clothing had somewhat changed. Hey, she did have book launches and signing, alright? She needs to look 'professional' and 'presentable'.She went to Harrods because it was quite obvious that most of the witches on that event would be wearing creations from Madam Malkin, so she went to the store where she had bought her little black dress for Ginny and Harry's engagement party…Chanel.Everything was made perfectly and would definitely catch any man's eyes. "Ugh, if Padma or Ginny were here..." She thought, tracing her fingers through the soft silk of a dress."May I help you Miss?" a sales lady asked. Hermione was scanning all the dresses in the room. "Yeah, I don't know what dress to choose. They are all lovely."The sales lady smiled. "Well, what kind of occasion would you be going to?"Hermione felt a blush form her cheeks. "I-I'm going to this date. My friend set me up."Do I really have to be this honest? She mentally smacked her head. She could've just said something else.The lady looked amused but said nothing. Instead, she went to the other side of the room and took two dresses. She went back to where Hermione was, who seemed to be talking to herself. The sales lady cleared her throat. Hermione jumped a little bit. She raised the two dresses in front of Hermione."These are the two newest dresses of our collection for this season. It would be perfect for your date."Oh, she is good. Hermione thought to herself.The dress on the left was lavender with no straps with a cute diamond in the middle. It had a bubble skirt short in front and long at the back. It was beautiful but a little too much. It was just a date!The other dress was peach. It had a sweetheart bodice and the skirt was up to the knee. It was just how she liked it, simple but chic.She obviously picked the peach dress. After paying it with her credit card, she went back to her place and started fixing her hair. She also fixed her makeup. Just a simple makeup that would make her eyes pop and a simple gloss in her lip. To be honest, she was having second thoughts. Ginny had been setting her up with okay guys, but no one seemed to be right for her. But she wouldn't back out. She was pacing on her room when she had a brilliant idea.oOoOoOoShe came in the restaurant on time, which meant earlier than the said time of the event. It had a wonderful set-up. The ceiling was just like the great hall. It showed the beautiful night's sky. There were ribbons and some heart shaped balloon which were either on the wall or floating on the air. She was greeted by the manager."Hello Miss-""Granger.""Miss Granger. You are a bit early for your date."Hermione snapped her head to the manager. "What date?"The manager gave a small smile. "I was informed about your date with-" he wasn't able to finish it because he heard a loud crash in the kitchen. Hermione was about to stop him when an usherette took Hermione's hand to place a pink ribbon on her wrist.Hermione pried her hand away and took the ribbon instead. She placed the ribbon on her purse. She went to an old lady standing nearby, whom she assumed was the host of this event. She was right; the lady had a nametag and was holding a clipboard with the checklist of the things to do. She offered her help but the lady refused."I know you are not quite done with the finishing touches." Hermione peered down the clipboard. "I could see there are still unchecked decorations. You see- I'm Hermione, Hermione Granger. And I'm great at multitasking. I'll show you."She quickly grabbed the woman's clipboard and went around the restaurant, instructing everyone who was placing the last minute decorations of the room.She turned around and told the other men who were setting up the speakers to place it in a certain direction. A waiter passed by and asked her to taste the food they were serving. Hermione took a bite. "A little more salt."The old woman was impressed. Everything was beginning to look perfect. She made a beeline to where Hermione was and took back her clipboard. "Very well, I will give you a nametag."Hermione smiled, her plan was working. If she became one of the event organizers, even for a while, she could observe the men that were coming to this event. She would know who her date was, if she managed to find her date. Ginny told her that she would know who her date was because their ribbons were magically linked with one another. If they met, it would both light up. Now that she was an organizer, she could wander around the restaurant with the ribbon hidden on her purse. If it lit up and she didn't like her date she could just leave. Seemed harsh, but that was the only way she could think of to save her from another bad date.The participants were arriving. She checked her ribbon and it was still on her purse. She scanned the room and saw some of her old Hogwarts friends, Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones. She even saw Daphne Greengrass and Tracy Davis.Then some men came in. They were all okay, some were familiar and some were also from Hogwarts. She blushed when she saw Oliver Wood, remembering the time when she had a huge crush on him.There were also new faces, she froze when she saw some friends of Viktor."Hi Hermione!"She turned and saw Hannah Abbot with Susan Bones. "Hi"Hannah seemed excited about this event. "Look at all these hot guys." She was eyeing at one brunette chap chatting with other bunch of guys. She noticed that Hermione wasn't wearing a pink ribbon. She frowned. "You're not a participant?"Hermione shrugged. "It depends."All girls took a glass of champagne when Hermione felt someone tap her shoulder. She glanced on her side and saw the old lady handing her a nametag. She grinned and thanked the lady. The lady raised her brow. "No, thank you. You did a splendid job here. I should hire you when I have another event."Hermione nodded. "I would love that. Thanks."The old lady turned her heels and strutted her way to the stage. The event was about to start. Hermione wore her tag, checking on the ribbon while she was on her way to the bar of the restaurant. It still didn't light up.She ordered a glass of martini from the bartender when she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned and saw that it was a handsome man. Her lips where starting to form a smile when it suddenly hit her. Her eyes grew wide. She remembered those silver eyes and blonde hair. "Malfoy?"The man seemed to have the same reaction. "G-Granger?"Bloody hell, he's hot. She thought to herself.

A/N: Hey guys! Thank you all for reading my fic and also for making it as one of your fave stories. As a token of my appreciation, TADA! Chapter 3! Fast update huh? Please review. I hope you guys would like this new chapter. Oh, this is still a flashback. This is the continuation of the speed dating event.Chapter threeTime seemed to stop. Everything fell silent. It was as if it was just the two of them in the restaurant. It was 3 years since the last time he saw Hermione and it was during the war. She was very thin that time and had blood and dirt all over her. He was ashamed of what he did and he tried to burry that memory on his mind. Now, everyone seemed to move on. He still had his money because of his mother's assets in France and his father just came out of Azkaban. Though out of prison, Lucius was forbidden to use his magic for the rest of his life.He doesn't want to think about the war. He wanted to focus on this beautiful woman in front of him. He always knew she was beautiful; he was just too stubborn to admit it. He covers his 'little crush' on her by teasing and mocking her.Then it suddenly hit him that he was probably looking like a gapping fish. He cleared his throat. Gods, he can't help it. She was really beautiful. She was even more beautiful than all the women he's been with. He noticed a small blush forming her cheeks. He smirked, curious at what was going on in the little witch's mind."Nice to see you here Malfoy. Aren't you supposed to be there?" she pointed towards the group of people who were seated in each table having idle chat.He snorted. "Of course not."She took his hand. He never felt such soft hands, except his of course, and his mother's. Electricity rushed through his veins, butterflies starting to form on his stomach. He raised his brow. He never knew Hermione was the kind of girl who makes the first move. He was about to speak when- "Well this ribbon says you are one of the participants." She said.He frowned. "This was actually a mistake. My good friend Theo set me up here so that doesn't mean that I'm a participant." He took his hand away as if her touch burned him. He placed his hand on his pocket. "And you? Why are you here? Are you a participant?"She made a face like Draco's an idiot. Well, he is an idiot. She was laughing inside her head. Now she's an idiot. She slightly shook her head and pointed at the name tag on her dress. "I'm the event organizer, Malfoy."Draco laughed, which in some odd way, hurt her feelings. "I knew there's something wrong with the decorations and setup with this place." He continued to laugh harder but he noticed that she wasn't joining him with his laughter. He cleared his throat and pointed around "The-the setting looks great. I mean, wonderful, brilliant."Hermione rolled her eyes and turned away from him taking a sip of her martini. Draco hung his head and cursed under his breath. How could he be such a git? Now he blew his chance with Granger. Well, Granger could be his only chance from saving him for meeting his date tonight. He doesn't care if his date was hot or a model. He wanted Granger. She is a whole package.Hot, beautiful, hot, smart, hot. He thought to himself. What more could he say?He noticed she was about to face him again so he fixed himself. "So why are you here and not over there?" she was really curious. She knew Draco Malfoy. He's been on newspapers and magazines. Not like she's been reading them, mind you. It's just… she knew Malfoy had no problems with women, so why would he join this event?He sat beside her. He glanced at her and looked directly in her eyes. "I'm here because I would like to know if you believe in love at first sight."She almost choked at her martini, amused at his statement. She shook her head. "No."She took another sip and when she glanced on her side, Malfoy was nowhere to be found. She perked her head up and looked around. Then she heard a pop behind her. She turned back around and saw Malfoy. "How about second sight?"She snorted. "Cheesy lines? Really? I never knew Draco Malfoy, the prince of the Slytherin house, was cheesy."Draco shrugged and sat beside her once again asking the bartender for a glass of scotch. The waiter gave him his glass then Hermione turned to face him. "Where were you last night?"Draco knotted his brows, confused at the sudden interest of Granger with his whereabouts. He thought for a moment. He actually can't remember where he was and who he was with. He was also wondering why he even bothered recalling his activities. It's not like she was his girlfriend. But then he remembered Blaise had this party. There were a lot of ladies that night and he was drunk- but he couldn't say that. He wouldn't say anything for Merlin's sake. He should show her that he was a responsible and matured man. "Uhh-at my office?"Hermione rested her head on her hand. "So that's why you weren't in my dreams last night."Draco thought for a moment and he chuckled, realizing that she was just saying a cheesy line. Who would've thought that the brightest witch of their age could also make up a cheesy line? He drank from his glass of scotch and placed it down gently. He was just staring at his glass, tapping his fingers on the table.Hermione took this opportunity to look at him. She studied every lines and curves of his face. She noticed his long fingers and how clean his nails were. His hair didn't have the same style he did at Hogwarts. It has a little short fringe. It was messy but neat at the same time.He was really handsome. She hoped Draco was his date tonight. She admits he was smart, though always second to her, at least he got brains. She suddenly remembered all the women he dated and unconsciously cursed under her breath. How could she compete with all those women? She isn't that 'hot' or that beautiful."What was that?" Draco asked.Hermione's head shot up. "N-Nothing." A small blush formed her cheeks again.He smirked. "You know, you're cute when you blush." He brushed his fingers on her cheek which made her blush some more. His face was near hers. "You know, you might not be able to come home tonight."Hermione swallowed, blood was rushing through her veins. She could feel her heart beating fast. Was he about to kiss her? She blinked, staring at his lips. "W-Why not?"He grinned "Because you're already in my mind." He let go and sat back up, finishing his scotch. Hermione was still in a daze when reality hit her. It was just another line. The corner of her lips slowly formed a smile."You know Malfoy, you're like shit."Draco choked on his drink. "What? Why?"Hermione giggled. "Because I can't play with you."They both laughed. Draco was having the best night of his life. Talking to Granger was easy. He sighed. "Wow. I've never been compared to shit before."Hermione smiled and looked at the crowd behind him. "I think you should go back there." She really didn't want him to go, but she still had to meet her date. It would be quite embarrassing if Draco knew she was having trouble with her dating side.He turned his head looking at the crowd, everyone was having a great time, but it still didn't interest him. He wanted to stay where he was. "Nah, I like it better here."Hermione couldn't help but smile. "I'm sorry, but I really want to know why you're here. I- I thought you were with Astoria."He snorted while facing back at her. "You too? Why does everyone think I'm with her?" She shrugged. "We were never together. I'm not with anyone. Unless of course, someone wants to change that." He was looking directly at her, making her feel uncomfortable.She shifted in her seat. "Well-" she tried to change the subject. "Do you want to know something?"Draco's brows furrowed. "What?" He was quite disappointed that she changed the subject.She leaned closer. "I'm not really the event organizer."Draco smirked. "I knew that."Hermione giggled and brushed a few strands of hair behind her ear. "Well, I'm just like you- like them." She cocked her head to the direction of the participants.He frowned. "You joined this speed, whatever thing?"He felt somewhat disappointed. It just doesn't seem right that the kind of woman like Hermione Granger, who is beautiful, intelligent, and again, hot, would ever join this kind of event.Hermione shook her head, she couldn't help but laugh. "No, goodness no. I have this date with someone."Draco felt relieved but also jealous; relieved that she isn't really a participant and jealous because she has a date with someone. He wanted to find out who was this guy she was supposed to meet and maybe give him a nice little chat. And by chat, meaning giving him a very bad boils or hex this chap's balls home."So, where is your date?" Draco asked, trying hard not to sound bitter.She shrugged. "I don't know, I'm suppose to wear this-" she took the ribbon from her purse. "And it would light up when I see him."She held it up, hoping that it would glow. She would be very happy if Draco was her date. They both waited but nothing happened. She frowned.Draco seemed upset too. He ordered another glass of scotch and when it came, he downed it in one gulp. He peered at her and saw her frowning. He placed his hand on hers which made her jump a little."You don't have to see your date Granger. Just stay here with me." He clasped his hand on hers and gave it a little squeeze. She smiled. "You know what? You're right. I'll stay here. It's time to try other fishes." She muttered, remembering what Ginny said.Draco raised his brow. "What fishes?"Hermione blushed and waved her free hand in front of her. "Nothing. Just remembered a conversation I had with Ginny."He chuckled. He was about to ask what was with the other fishes when he felt someone behind him. He turned his head and saw the old lady who was the host of this event. "Excuse me young man, but I think you should be staying over there."Draco smirked. "No. I'm staying here."The old lady took his arm and pulled him. She led him to a table where a young woman was waiting for him.Hermione stood up and quickly placed the ribbon on her wrist. She trailed behind them and took Draco's other hand, which caused the lady to lose her balance. Good thing someone stopped her from falling. The restaurant fell silent.The lady fixed herself and cleared her throat. "Please proceed. No harm done." She announced.Everyone went back to what they were doing. Draco heard someone snicker. He peered to his left and saw the culprit, Blaise. He smirked.The lady faced Draco and saw that Hermione's arm was linked to his."Miss Hermione, am I right? You are the organizer. You should know that this man shouldn't be wandering around the place and should participate in this event.""Oh, I'm done being the organizer. The truth is… I'm a participant too." She held out her wrist.The lady pursed her lips. "Very well, go find yourselves a seat." She held her head high and elegantly walked away.Draco and Hermione sighed in relief. They were heading back to their 'spot' when Draco pulled her back. His face was near hers. She thought he was going to tell another cheesy line when she felt his lips on hers. Her eyes grew wide but as the kiss grown deeper, she felt her eyes close. His lips were soft and sweet.She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer. He grinned and wrapped his arms around her waist. He kissed her deeper until they were both out of breath. He pulled away, his hands on her hips. Hermione was still in a daze when she noticed something behind Draco's neck. He turned his head and took her wrist.The ribbon glowed. He looked at his ribbon and it was glowing too.They both smiled, pulling her once again for another kiss.A/N: See? A new update already? Please, PLEASE review. So I would know what you guys think. Still need beta. I already started the next chapter. Not sure if I could update as fast as this one. Have to do this documentation for thesis. BTW, this scene isn't exactly the same as the movie. I changed it a little so I could connect it with Draco and Hermione, but the cheesy lines were really a part of that movie. So, again, review and need a beta. Sorry if I repeat British expressions, I don't really know how to make this britglish. Next chapter would probably be a little more flashbacks, but the present time would come soon.

A/N: Thank you for the reviews. If ever someone knows how the 'beta thing' work, please tell me asap. Also thank you for making this your favorite and following my story and for some who made me their favorite author. I can't stop smiling. Okay, so this chapter is the last flashbacks of Draco. It may seem a bit too fast, but the story isn't how they fell in love. It's about falling in love again. Okay, on to the story. P.S there would be scenes in the present time.Chapter fourPresent dayDraco flopped down on his couch. He had a lot of drink from Blaise's wedding and was feeling a little pissed. He lay down on his back and pinched the bridge of his nose, inhaling deeply as he stopped himself from vomiting all over his brand new carpet. He placed both his arms at the back of his head and stared at the ceiling. He's been trying to avoid memories of Hermione for too long. It's been a difficult thing to do. Sometimes he would succeed by keeping himself busy with work or with another girl but by the end of the day, Hermione would always cross his mind. He sighed and closed his eyes, remembering the good times he had with her.Flashback1[Hermione and Draco had been going out for months now]"Hi, you guys came." Hermione greeted her Gryffindor friends while leading them inside an exclusive room of the restaurant. "Of course we came. We won't leave you alone with those snakes." Ron muttered, receiving a slight poke on his rib from his sister. "Don't mind Ron, he's just hungry." Gin said while giving Hermione a tight hug.Harry gave her a small hug and kissed her cheek but didn't say anything else. She understood that he wasn't comfortable. Well, at least he isn't the only one.Draco and Hermione both decided to have this dinner so their friends would get along with each other. It was a very long process of planning, arguing, and organizing and let's say they had a pretty tough time convincing them to come. It was the right thing to do since they are officially dating now, well, they think it is the right thing.Hermione invited Ginny, Harry, Ron, Lavander, Neville, Katie and Luna. Dean can't join them because he is in Rome and the Weasly twins said they will try to follow. Draco invited Blaise, Pansy, Theo, and Marcus. He didn't want to invite Crabbe and Goyle to avoid any further embarrassment.There were glaring and silent curses for the first few hours until Crabbe and Goyle came. Draco cursed under his breath and placed his hand on his forehead. Hermione took his free hand and gave it a little squeeze."We heard there is a dinner party so we brought this." Goyle brought out a lot of bottles of tequila, vodka and other alcoholic drinks. Crabbe waved his wand and started the music. "Who would like to take the first shot?" Luna stood and took the glass and downed it in one drink. She didn't flinch or anything, she just took the lime from Goyle and sat back down on her seat.Crabbe and Goyle looked at each other and shrugged."Com'on guys. It's time to party." Crabbe saidJust then Fred and George came and brought some colored lights with them and even more drinks. "Yeah, this party needs to loosen up." Fred muttered. Hermione stood and gave them a hug. "Thanks for coming guys."Fred and George grinned and started to change the setting of their room.Blaise began to stand and dance with Pansy, Marcus and Katie.Ron and Theo started to have a competition with shots.Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Draco were cheering Neville and Luna as they were having body shots.Everyone was getting real drunk and had lots of fun. Hermione laughed how everything turned out. Alcohol could really make impossible things possible. Let's just see if this getting along will last until tomorrow.Flashback2"Wow, this ballet flat shoes looks great." Hermione said while checking it out on the mirror. Draco smiled. "Green really looks good on you." She playfully rolled her eyes and continued to look at the shoes on her feet."So would you pay through cash or check?" asked the sales lady.Hermione stopped and glanced at the lady. "How much is this?"The lady smiled. "That would be five hundred fifty pounds."Hermione almost lost her balance. She took them off and placed it back on the shelf. She was putting on her old shoes when Draco took the new pair she wanted. "We'll pay through cash." The lady nodded and left.He sat beside her. "I don't want you to buy things for me." She said in a low voice. Draco grinned. "But I want to." She gave him a look. "Okay, okay. Just think of it as my gift for you."She giggled. "A gift for what?" He smiled and kissed her gently on her lips. "For loving me each and every day." Her smile grew wide and she pulled him for another kiss. She pulled away and rested her forehead on his. "Thank you." She whispered.After paying at the cashier, Hermione took her camera from her purse. She took a picture of the ballet flats on the box and another picture with Draco holding it. Draco couldn't help but smile. Hermione loves taking pictures of them and the places they went. He was also amazed how good she was at it. She takes the best pictures even in simple places like this shoe store.Flashback 3Draco was tapping his foot and constantly checking his watch. Hermione had a surprise for him but she was taking too long. He finally heard her go out of her room. He stood up. "It's about t-" he wasn't able to finish his sentence because she took his arm and apparated both of them to a dark place.He held his one hand on Hermione's shoulder while the other hand was clutching his stomach. He felt dizzy because of the side apparition. When the dizziness subsided, he gently pinched her bum which caused her to jump a little. "Don't ever apparate me into a dark place without me knowing. I hate that. And we could've just gone to a closet if you wanted to do something in the dark."She ignored him and opened the door. He was slightly blinded by the sudden brightness. When his eyes finally adjusted to the light, he realized where they were."The Boldeian Library?" he asked. Hermione turned to face him. "How did you know?"Draco snorted and wandered his eyes around. "My mother's side of the family donated original manuscripts here.""Oh.""How did you have access here?" he asked placing his arm around her shoulder. She smiled. "A good friend of mine works here."He glanced at her. "And who is this good friend of yours may I ask?"She snorted. "Jealous, love? That good friend of mine is Sara – Not from Hogwarts."He formed a small 'O' on his mouth.She led him to an aisle. "This is my spot." She was taking off some books out of the lowest part of the shelf. "I hid my favorite book here."She sat down on the floor and pulled him down to sit beside her."I've been reading it every summer during Hogwarts. You should read this. It's a great romance novel."He made a face. "No thanks. I would rather read-" he looked around and took a book on the shelf on top of her head. "I would rather read this.""A tragedy novel?"He nodded. She shrugged and started to read her book. Hermione laid down on his lap as they read both in silence. He closed his book and placed it back on the shelf. Hermione sat back up and handed him her book. "Now read this."He shook his head."Even if it's my favorite?" she pouted.He nodded. "Yeah, I don't like romance novels."She shoved it one his chest. "Read it now."He placed the book back on the shelf. "No thanks.""Read it.""No.""Draco.""Hermione." He mocked."Just try it.""What's with the book anyway? I don't like those kinds of genres. I wouldn't read it even if it's the last book on this bloody planet." He stood and stormed off.Hermione sighed and took her notebook from her purse. She was scribbling something and tore it from her notebook and folded it neatly. She just wanted him to read her favorite book. It's a story called 'A Knight in Shining Armor'. She just wanted to share what made her believe in change and how love can enact that change. Maybe Draco would read it someday. She felt bad for forcing him to read something he didn't like. So she placed the book back to the shelf and looked for Draco.She found him outside the library, his back facing hers. She snaked her arms around his waist and rested her head on his back. "I'm sorry for forcing you on something you don't like."He turned to face her, "No, I'm sorry for acting that way."She smiled. "Are you hungry? I know a great place to eat."After their meal, the rain started to pour. Draco took off his coat and placed it on top of her head. He took her hand, about to rush through the streets when she pulled him back. "Wait."She took off her shoes, which he gave, and placed it inside her shirt. "I don't want to ruin these good shoes."He smiled. She was the first woman he dated who valued the gifts he gave. Though this gift wasn't that much compared to the other gifts he'd given to the gold diggers, she still valued them. She valued them because it was from him, which touched his stone cold heart. Just this scenario made him regret dating all those women who just wanted him for his money."Then I'll carry you." He offered. "I don't like my love getting her feet dirty."She laughed and hopped on his back.She took a small umbrella from her purse and used it to cover their heads.Draco laughed because the umbrella was too small. How could that umbrella be useful if it barely covers both of their heads?He started to walk slowly."Am I heavy?" she asked, trying to get down.He held her on place. "No. Let's just enjoy ourselves under the rain." He started jumping from one puddle to another.She squealed because she almost fell from his grasp. Draco laughed and she followed suit. She threw the umbrella away as she held on tight to Draco, kissing him on his cheek. "I love you."Draco glanced at her. "I love you."Flashback 4(Meeting the Parents)They were driving on their way to where Hermione's parents lived. Draco was very nervous at that time. He wanted to make an impression. Once they arrived, she quickly pulled him out of the car and unlocked the door with her wand.She asked him to take a seat and told him to wait there while she went up to the room. He fixed himself, relieved that her parents weren't there yet. He took this opportunity to think of ways to impress them and the right things to say or do. This was his first time introducing himself to his girlfriend's parents, lest a Muggle.Hermione came down with two beautiful urns. "This is my mum and dad."He had no idea her parents were dead. He felt like a douche. What kind of boyfriend is he?She really didn't talk about them and he never asked. He was afraid that talking about her parents would lead to his parents, who obviously taunted her and her kind.He stood and slightly nodded. "Good morning Mr. and Mrs. Granger. It's my pleasure to finally meet you both. You've raised a wonderful and beautiful daughter. I'm a very lucky man."She formed a small smile, trying to blink the tears away.Days passed and now it was Hermione's time to be nervous. She would meet his parents. Well, she met them already, but this time, it's different. She'll meet them and introduce herself as their son's girlfriend. She swallowed. She tried to shift her mind by looking around the parlor. The Malfoy's moved to a new mansion because the Malfoy Manor was taken down by the Ministry.Their new home was much brighter and livelier. There was a garden full of tulips, must be Draco's doing. She was anxiously waiting. Draco, who was sitting beside her, noticed that she was squirming from her seat and unconsciously playing with her fingers. He took her hand and gave it a little squeeze. "Relax. It will be alright."She nodded, but she was still nervous. She thought of the worst possible case scenario, maybe a little hex from his mother and some insults from his father. She shook her head slightly. Draco wouldn't let that happen to her. Right?She was about to ask Draco if they could just meet them another time when she her the door open. Draco stood and so did she. Narcissa was still as beautiful and as graceful as ever and just a few steps behind her was Lucius.Narcissa came near them and kissed Draco on the cheek. "Mother." She smiled, hinting some small wrinkles on the corner of her eyes. "It's nice to see you home darling."Draco shifted his eyes to Lucius. He gave a short nod. "Father." Lucius smirked and sat down on the loveseat across them. Narcissa sat beside him.Draco and Hermione sat down as well. "Mother, Father, this is my girlfriend - Hermione. You remember her don't you? We went to school together."Narcissa looked at Hermione and smiled. "Yes, I do remember her. Miss Granger, am I right?"Hermione nodded. "Yes. It's my pleasure to meet you Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy." she was stuttering.Draco placed his hand on the small of her back to assure her that everything would be alright.Lucius was very quiet but Hermione didn't see any hint of disgust or disapproval. She wondered what was going on inside of the old man's mind."So, how did you two meet? Well, after the –" Narcissa stopped as she noticed Hermione flinch. "- I'm sorry dear. I shouldn't have brought it up."Hermione has moved on with the memory she had during the war. It was just the first time she heard it from the Malfoys and more so talking about it with a nice cup of tea."It's okay, Mrs. Malfoy. ""Please do call me Narcissa."Hermione gave a small smile. "Narcissa. Draco and I met at a restaurant."Both women were now talking and sharing stories. Lucius still haven't talked, he just sipped on his cup of tea and stared on his Malfoy ring. Draco was silent too but deep in his mind he was happy. It's good to see that the two important women in his life were having a good time. His mother has moved on with the whole Muggles and Purebloods. Since the war ended, his mother has been very happy. He could see it in her eyes. They wouldn't be hiding in fear because of Voldemort.Lucius stood and excused himself, he asked Draco to come with him.They were just outside the parlor. "Father.""Draco."To his surprise, Lucius pulled him in an embrace. "It's nice for you to come home." He gave a small pat on Draco's back. Draco was just in shock to even respond. He never came home to see his old folks. He would only be there when they were gone to a vacation or something. He was just trying to avoid them, to avoid any conversations or whatnots.Lucius pulled away. "So, you and Miss Granger?"Draco nodded. "Yes. We've been dating for eight months now."Lucius looked down the floor and then back at Draco. Draco expected a punch on his face or his gut, but nothing came."Why didn't you let us know about her soon? Why only now?"Draco may look like a gapping fish right now with what his father was saying. Is this really Lucius Malfoy? He thought of the show Hermione asked him to watch, it's called punk'd. Maybe he was being punk'd, and Hermione was behind it."I – I" He started to stutter."I understand." His father said."So you are okay with me dating a Muggle born?"Lucius smirked. "Is my opinion really necessary? You're a grown man Draco and you're my son. I know you. I know the look you have when you like something that you really want. I bought you all of those things and now, I can see that look again. And this time, you already have it."Draco smirked. Wow, he really never expected that those words would come from a stone hearted Lucius Malfoy. How could that happen? He still felt hesitant though. If his father knew him, like he think he did, then he knew his own father as well."Thank you, Father."Lucius nodded and went back inside the parlor room. They could hear laughter. Hermione was now sitting beside Narcissa who was holding a baby album."And this was the first time Draco rode a horse. He was very afraid of that horse." Hermione giggled. She could see a crying Draco who has snot on his nose."Mother! No baby pictures." Draco was horrified. Taking the photo album and placing it back on the shelf."Oh darling, I just want Hermione to see how cute you were. Isn't that right?" she turned to face Hermione who nodded in agreement.Draco rolled his eyes and sat down on the sofa. Lucius sat down on the arm chair which was beside Hermione. "Love, why don't you show Miss Granger Draco's picture when he first started to ride a broom?"Hermione took it as a sign of approval from Lucius."No!" yelled Draco. He glared at the old man, while Lucius smirked. Narcissa clapped in delight. "Oh that's right. Now where did I put it?""Mother!"Narcissa waved her hand. "Stop it Draco, you're acting like a child. You embarrass us.""You embarrass me." He muttered.He doesn't want Hermione to see how scared he was when he first rode his broom. He just wanted her to think the first time they rode their broom in Hogwarts. He hoped he impressed her during those days."This is your first time to introduce us a girl. You never bring a girl here. It's her right to know what kind of a little boy you were." She said, still looking for the album. Hermione blushed a little. So she was the only girl he brought to his parents home."Father, please stop Mother from embarrassing me."Lucius took a sip from his tea. "Not my problem."Draco groaned and tried to stop his mother from looking for the album.Hermione couldn't help but laugh. The Malfoy family is just like any other family. Well, maybe before they were different. Maybe things have really changed during the war. It was surreal for her to see this. She thought the Malfoys were stone cold hearted wizards. She was wrong. Seeing them made her feel like a part of this family. She missed her parents. She missed having her parents around.Narcissa was very kind to her and she felt her motherly-love. When Draco and Lucius left, Narcissa hugged her and kissed her cheek. She told Hermione that Draco was very lucky to have her in his life. She also told her that she was like a daughter she never had.It was weird for her to hear that from Narcissa. But she felt her sincerity when she told her all those things. She now had a new family. She hoped above all that this would be forever. She took a photo of the family and one photo with her. She never wanted to forget this day.It was almost time to leave, Narcissa started to have teary eyes. "You should both visit us again. Okay?"Draco hugged his mother and his father. "Okay."Hermione hugged Narcissa and when Lucius was in front of her, he hugged her for a while which brought chills to her spine. "Thank you." He whispered. When he pulled back he stood beside his wife."Goodbye." Narcissa waved her hand.They apparated back to her flat. "I'm so embarrassed." Draco muttered. Hermione pulled him and kissed him on his lips. "Don't be. I love you. I love you so much. And besides, you were really a cute baby."Draco laughed and pulled her to a deeper kiss.Flashback 5Hermione was fast asleep. Draco was staring at her, she looks like an angel. The sun is reflecting her hair which looked like a halo. He kissed her gently on the lips. She sighed and moved a little. "Will you marry me?" He said in a soft voice. She hugged him closer and her eyes opened, realizing what he just said. She rushed to the bathroom and gargled. She sat back on the bed beside him. "What did you say?" He sat up and took a magic thread on his pocket. He took a fair length and took her hand."When I was young, I always forget things. I was even worse than Longbottom. My father would always get mad at me because Malfoys don't forget. My mother would go to my room and put a thread on my finger." He placed a thread on her ring finger, and slowly knotted it to a ribbon. "I would wear it the whole day because every time I see it, I remember what she said."He held her hand and rubbed it with his thumb. "Whenever you see this, you would always remember that I asked you to be my wife. That is, if you want."She placed her hand beside his face and took a picture of it with her camera. She placed the camera back down and kissed him."Yes, a million times yes.''Draco smiled and kissed her deeply. When they broke their kiss, the thread transformed to a platinum gold ring with a square cut emerald. She gasped at the beauty of the ring on her finger, tears forming her eyes. She pulled him in her arms and gave him a small peck on the cheek. "I love you so much Draco Malfoy."Flasback 6The sight of her at the end of the aisle was just too much for him. She was really beautiful, like an angel sent from the heavens. She was beaming at him. Thoughts came rushing through his mind. He was sweating and his heart was beating fast. He was feeling something inside him. Fear? Doubt? Cold feet? He doesn't know. Hermione was already a few steps away from him when he felt his foot step forward. He kept walking and walking. Hermione stopped. He passed right at her without even glancing back.Present DayDraco froze. This is why he avoided memories about Hermione. He would remember the good ones but after all those memories, it would always end on their wedding. Not a day have gone by when he regretted leaving her on the aisle. He sighed. He let the only woman who ever made him truly happy, who ever loved him despite of his past get away. He took a glass of scotch. He downed it in one swift and threw the glass across the room. He was such a fool.A/N: Sorry for the late update, been very busy this week. I'll try to update soon. Please review. Thank you.

A/N: Wow! That was a lot of views! Thank you all so much. But please review. I would really appreciate that. So here is Chapter five. I will try to update more often, been very busy lately. I don't own anything. And chapter five and above would be present day now. This Chapter was the next day after Blaise and Pansy's wedding.Chapter 5Present DayDraco woke up, his room was still pitch black. He was trying to reach for his wand by his bedside table, but failed to find it."Accio wand" he mumbled, and in a second his wand was in his grasp. He gave a little swish and the curtains opened, slightly blinding him by the light coming from outside. He squinted his eyes and tried to cover it with his hand. When it didn't work, he dug himself back to his covers. He had a terrible hangover. A hangover and a lack of sleep due to those random memories really don't go well together.He dragged himself out of the bed and went to his kitchen. "Hey Draco!" someone said behind the counter. Draco jumped. It was Theo. He groaned and took a cup of coffee. He dragged himself to the couch when someone just popped behind him which caused Draco to jump again and let some coffee spill on his new rug. He cursed under his breath."Good morning Draco." It was Blaise, taking off the stain with a simple spell.Draco rolled his eyes and sat, putting the cup of coffee on the small table across him. "Mind telling me who else is here?"Blaise chuckled. "Nah. It's just us."Draco eyed him for a while and when he was sure Blaise wasn't up for another joke, he drank his coffee and started to open the pages of the Daily Prophet.Blaise and Theo looked at each other and Theo nodded, telling him it's the best time to talk to Draco.Theo sat beside Draco, placing his scone on the coffee table and they were both sitting across Blaise."Hey Draco, I'm sorry for bringing up Hermione." Blaise said, looking very sincere.Draco continued reading. "That's nothing."Theo glanced at him. "So you're okay?"Draco snorted like it was the most stupid question he's ever heard. "Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay?"They were all silent when Blaise stood. "Well, since we're all okay. Would you guys accompany me to Diagon Alley? Pansy wanted me to buy this book about baby names." Draco was still reading. He hasn't been to Diagon Allley for a very long time and he never planned to even set foot on that place. First thing was the memories during the war. Yes, it was a long time ago, but some memories still send chills to his spine.The second is, to avoid people who are close to Hermione and Hermione. Well, now he wanted to see her and talk her. But he wasn't quite sure if he would even be alive before he reaches her, knowing that the Boy who lived is her best friend. He wasn't afraid of her friends, mind you, but he was afraid of seeing her again. What would he say? 'Hey, remember me? The guy who ditched you in the aisle?' or 'I'm sorry about what happened before, I hope we could start again.'He was sent back to reality when he felt Theo nudged his arm. "Sure, we'll go."He glared at Theo. His friends had gone mental.Blaise pumped his fist in the air which made Theo chuckle and Draco groan. "So now that everyone agreed, Draco- change your clothes or we'll apparate you there in just your boxers."Draco smirked. "Every witch would love that."Blaise frowned. "And you smell."Draco sneered at Blaise and threw the Daily Prophet on the Theo's face. He knew he doesn't smell. He never had body odor or any disgusting thing a wizard or muggle men have. Blaise may be referring to the smell of all the drink he's taken. He darted to his room and slammed the door shut.Blaise grinned. "It really is a great day, isn't it?"Theo snorted and ate the scone on the table.Draco was staring at a book while Blaise and Theo were watching him quietly. He was staring at a copy of 'Hogwarts: A History'. He darted his eyes to the book next to it. 'The Most Beautiful Muggle Born' He sighed. "I wish my life was written in a book so I could just erase the ugly ones and change it good ones."Blaise and Theo gave him a small pat on the back. "That's alright mate, there are other girls in the world. Theo and I can hook you up with one, or we could find you a perfect one here in Flourish and Blotts".Blaise craned his neck around and searched for possible prospects. Theo continued to read the book he was holding. Draco sighed again and took 'Hogwarts: A History'When the book was in his hands, he glanced back up and saw from the empty space a familiar beautiful brunette on the other side. His eyes grew wide, stunned, and unconsciously dropped the book he was holding. The book landed on Blaise's foot. Theo snickered. Blaise bit his lip, trying to stop himself from yelling."Bloody mother-ffff- I'm gonna kill you Malfoy." Blaise said through gritted teeth. They heard someone shush them.Draco ignored Blaise and the other incoherent words coming from his mouth. He followed the brunette, lowering his head whenever the girl glances sideways. Her hair was straight with soft waves at the end. She was wearing a blue floral dress and a white cardigan. He looked at what shoe she was wearing and frowned, because it wasn't the one he bought. She was wearing pink flat shoes.Draco took a book that someone was reading and tried to cover his face. Blaise and Theo followed. "What's wrong?" Theo whispered copying his actions, taking a book from another random person. They heard someone say inappropriate words, they shushed the culprit.Blaise was still rubbing his foot every stop they did. "Seriously, Draco, what are you doing? You look like an idiot. You both do."Draco was still watching the brunette, who now took a book from the shelf. "I think I saw Hermione." He whispered. Theo's brow shot up. "Really? Where?""I'm not yet sure if it's her. She's over there, the girl wearing a white cardigan." He pointed to where the girl was and ducked again because she went to another direction. They followed her and they were one shelf behind her. Blaise sighed and walked past them. "This is getting stupid- Hi Herm-" Draco pushed him which caused them to stumble on the floor. The girl jumped a little and glanced at their direction. Her eyes grew wide. Draco gave a small smile. It was Hermione, his Hermione.Theo helped both Draco and Theo up. They brushed themselves. Flourish and Blotts sure needs to sweep their floor from time to time, Draco thought.Draco walked towards Hermione, who was still staring at him."Hi, Hermione. How are you?"Wow, how could I ask that? 'How are you'? Pathetic, Malfoy. He thought.She didn't respond. She was still looking at him. She might've thought the same thing. A few seconds passed and she finally opened her mouth to speak. He swallowed. Here it goes."Who are you? Do I know you?"Draco's heart stopped, his smile faded. He just realized that he's been smiling the whole time. Things came rushing through his mind. He was confused, hurt, happy and embarrassed all at the same time. It wasn't that long ago since they last saw each other. And who could ever forget the person who left you in the aisle?"Sorry." Hermione gave a weak smile. "I have amnesia. I don't remember anyone or anything from my past. But I really have to go, so…bye." She spun on her heels and made a beeline to the door leaving Draco staring at the empty space she was just standing at.Blaise and Theo went to where he was as soon as Hermione left. Theo looked at Draco. "What happened? What did she say? Why did she go?"Draco didn't answer. He just stood there. He too had a lot of questions in mind. He was sure she was Hermione. She looked exactly like the last time he saw her, even more beautiful …if that was possible. He knew it had been a year and few months since their wedding and a lot of things could've happened. But, amnesia? What was that?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThey went back to Theo's place. Draco was still looking pensive. Blaise took a bottle of scotch and three goblets while Theo took a book from the shelf. "Here it is. Amnesia is a partial or total loss of memory, usually resulting from shock, psychological disturbance, brain injury, or illness.""It's like obliviate." Blaise concluded. "Maybe Hermione had an accident which caused her brain injury."Draco was still quiet. Maybe she had an accident after he left their wedding."Maybe she got an accident after you left." Theo said, which made Draco glance at him because he said the same thing he was thinking. "Maybe she ran after you and didn't notice the car coming."It might've what had happened. But, she doesn't look like she had an accident. She was as beautiful as ever. Maybe something else had happened during a year and a half ago.Draco rubbed his face with his palm. First he left her, then because of what he did, Hermione had an accident. He felt like he was worst than his father. She had gone through so much. She didn't deserve all of this.Because of what he did, all her memories were lost. What's worst is it couldn't be reversed through magic.Her memory was lost forever.A/N: Chapter six coming up. BUT PLEASE REVIEW. Hahaha. Review Review. I know this is short but I'm now writing chapter six.





--------




A/N: I know Chapter five was too short. Sorry about that. I was really in a rush with writing it because I was sick. The weather's been pretty bad. Please review. Haha. Thank you.Chapter six"Blimey! I didn't know you had an accident and amnesia, Hermione." Ron said and he suddenly felt someone sack him behind his head."It's because she didn't have an accident or had amnesia, you dolt." Ginny sneered.Ron glared at his sister while rubbing the back of his head. "Hey, I'm still your big brother Gin. Hit me one more time and I'm telling mum."Harry snickered and took Ginny's hand. "Come here love, we don't want Ron telling your mum now, do we?"Ginny smirked, giving one last look at her brother. Ron hit Harry on the arm. "That's for not backing me up Harry."Ginny shook her head and glanced to where Hermione was, who was still staring out the window."Why did you tell Draco you had amnesia when you obviously don't? And you don't even look like you had an accident or something." Ginny said as she sat on Harry's lap.Hermione rubbed the back of her neck and turned to face her friends. "I know! I-I just panicked, okay?" She sat down on the arm rest of the couch. "I haven't seen that bastard for more than a year. I've killed him in my mind already, which by the way, I would love to do in real life after what he has done to me. It's like he rose from the dead after I buried him alive. So – I just told him the first thing that popped my mind." She dug her face on her palm.Harry snorted. "The brightest witch of our age's mind first thought of amnesia? Wow. Nice one, Hermione." He started to laugh, Ron followed.Hermione's head shot up. She and Gin glared at the two boys. When they finally got the message, they stopped and cleared their throat.Ron spoke again. "Why didn't you just punch him in the face like you did before? Or give him a stinging hex or something." His voice slowly faded as he said his second suggestion because Hermione was giving him another death glare."Do I have to repeat it Ron? Honestly? I said I panicked, okay?"Ron swallowed and nodded."So-" Ginny began "What if he tries to get you back?"Hermione sat up and looked smug. "That is if he gets me back. I've learned from the past and I won't make the same mistakes again. I've fallen for that bastard once and that would be the last one."Harry sighed and took her hand. "Look, 'Mione, I really don't like this idea. Just tell him the truth and move on. You would just get hurt all over again. And besides, I might not be able to stop myself from killing him once I see him."Hermione gave a small smile and placed her free hand on top of his. "I know, Harry. But I've just seen him once and I know he wouldn't show up again. And even if he does, I could handle myself."She looked at her friends who were still wasn't sure with her idea. She stood. "I can handle myself. I promise."All three gave her a small smile, stood and headed to the kitchen. Dinner was almost ready.Hermione was left on the couch. She sighed. She wasn't sure what she got herself into.The next day, Ginny and Hermione went back to their studio in Muggle London. They were becoming popular since they take the best pictures…with a little help of magic of course. They also have a studio in Diagon Alley. They go there from time to time but they spend most of their time in London because they have more customers. Hermione decided that she would be working in the muggle world more often because of the 'incident' she had yesterday in Diagon Alley. You know – a certain pale skinned, platinum blonde haired git with those annoying smirks.She would let Ginny do all the work in the wizarding world.Elena, their secretary, was answering calls and writing down their appointments while Hermione was taking pictures of a family. It was just another ordinary day, as if nothing happened yesterday. Hermione felt good about it. Maybe it was the last time she would see Malfoy in the flesh.Hermione heard someone enter, since a small bell would ring when someone opens the door. She glanced and saw Theo. Her eyes grew wide and returned to taking pictures of the family."Hello Miss-" Theo muttered and looked at the name tag of Elena. "- Elena. Is Hermione here?""Yes, she's having a shoot right now. You could just wait for her over there."Hermione thanked Merlin for telling Elena everything, like Draco and his friends. Elena is actually a squib. She knew all about the witches and wizards and why the bloody hell Hermione hates Draco Malfoy.Theo nodded. "Okay." But he continued to enter the studio. Before Elena could stop him, he was standing behind Hermione. He tapped her shoulder. Hermione clicked her camera and sighed quietly. She turned around and smiled at him. "Yes? May I help you?"Theo smiled, confused. "Hermione, it's me…Theo?"Hermione was still smiling at him."Uh- you really don't remember me, do you?"Hermione raised her brow. "Mmm- Nope. Why? Sorry. I have amnesia so I can't remember you."Theo just stood there, not knowing what else to say. He shifted from foot to foot."So, Theo – right? Sorry, but I'm kind of in a middle of a shoot here. You could tell Elena what I could help you with and we'll contact you as soon as possible.""Oh, that's okay. I just remembered I left a potion at home. So I have to go. Thanks." Theo turned his heel and flee as quickly as possible."Wow, Hermione, I didn't know you were such a great actress." Elena said.Hermione couldn't help but giggle. "I know right? Why haven't I considered trying an acting career?"She turned to face the family she was taking pictures of. They didn't hear her conversation with Theo because they were a few steps away. She took one more photo. "Okay, we're done."Draco, Blaise and Marcus were just waiting a few blocks away from the studio when they spotted Theo coming."What happened?" Draco asked, looking at the studio from time to time."Yes, that's Hermione. She's even more beautiful than I remembered. I think I looked like a drooling dog back there."Draco and Blaise gave him a look while Marcus snickered.Theo shrugged. "What? She's hot mate. And yeah, she doesn't remember me."Draco sighed. "Alright, let's go back to my flat."Blaise took his arm. "Wait. This is your chance, Drake. You should go there.""Do you think she'll ever forgive me after what I did to her? Forget it." He pried his arm away and started to walk away until Blaise took his arm again."Yes, she won't forgive you. But she doesn't remember any of the things you did to her before. She has amnesia. Think of this as another opportunity for you to make things right."Marcus nodded. "Yeah, this is a fresh start."Theo's brows furrowed. "Isn't it like fooling her again? And lying to her would even make things worse?" Blaise shushed him and at the same time Marcus glared at him."Don't mind Theo. He doesn't know what he's saying." Blaise pushed Draco to the direction of the studio."Come on." Marcus pushed "We'll go there with you. Besides, I want to see how hot your new Hermione is." Draco glared at him but continued his was to the studio.Hermione was scanning through the photos she's taken when she heard the door bell ring. She peeked through the wall and saw the last man she ever wanted to see with his fellow Slytherins. She swallowed and hid behind her desk. She could only handle one Slytherin at a time with her 'acting skills'. Why on earth is Draco Malfoy here and how did he find her?Stalker. She thoughtElena gave them a small smile. "Good morning Sir. How may I help you? Do you need some photos taken?"Draco smirked. "No, I'm looking for Hermione Granger."She could feel her heart beat fast. What should she do? She wasn't prepared for this.Com'on Hermione, think. Think! Blaise and Marcus were checking the place out while Theo was flipping through the portfolio on the other side of the room. He was trying to cover his face before Elena would recognize him but failed miserably.Blaise went to further to the studio and saw a head under the desk. He knew it was Hermione."Hi Hermione!"Hermione jumped and bumped her head on the edge of the desk. She gave her head a little massage before sitting back up. She turned to face him and gave him a fake smile. "Hi to you too Mister -?"Blaise smiled back, offering his hand. "Zabini, but you could call me Blaise."Hermione shook his hand. "It's nice to meet you Blaise."In a few seconds, Draco and Marcus were behind him. "Hi, Hermione." Draco muttered.She could feel her blood rushing through her veins. She doesn't know if it was anger or happiness. No, it was definitely anger. How could she be happy to see Draco? Well, he does look good. She mentally smacked her head. What's happening to her? She shouldn't let his looks, charm and that- that smirk get into her again.She bit her tongue before she could say anything else. She made another fake smile. "Hi." She turned to face her computer again but then she thought of something better. She turned back to face them."Hey! I think I saw you before." She exclaimed.Draco's smile froze. She couldn't possibly remember him. Yeah, it could be great to have her memories back, but if she did remember everything…she would remember him. And if she remembers him, he's dead by now.He thought for a second. "Yeah, at Flourish and Blotts." He stammered.Hermione pretended to think and she abruptly stood. "That's right. You're the guy who fell in the floor. So why are you here? You're not following me, are you?"Draco shook his head. "No. I- My friends and I want to take a group photo. We heard this is one of the best studios in London."Hermione faked a laugh and walked past them. "Why didn't you say so. Let's start then.""A group photo?" Blaise whispered. Draco just pulled him along and Marcus trailed behind them.She saw Theo sitting at the waiting area. "Aren't you supposed to be home to check the potion you were brewing?"Draco, Blaise and Marcus looked confused. What in the hell did Theo tell Hermione?The waved a hand. "I just remembered I've finished it earlier. You see, I was the best in potions at school."Hermione raised a brow. These guys have been pushing it too far. She bit her tongue again. She hoped above hope that this day would end. These Slytherins have been getting on her nerves already. "Is that so? I bet you know the secret herb to make a verisaterum even more powerful."Theo nodded. "Of course I do."Hermione pursed her lips. "Then what is it?"He looked at his watch. "Oh, fu- look at the time. It's time for you to take our photo."Hermione rolled her eyes and went ahead to the photo shoot area. Draco pulled Theo on one side. "What the fuck Theo? Just shut up." He whispered.Theo nodded. "Sorry, Drake."Hermione asked them to stand in front of her. She magically turned their background into a burning forest. "This is the perfect one for your photo."The guys didn't mind. They weren't really interested in having a group photo at the first place.Hermione took some photos and checked it on the small screen.Draco's friends urged him to go and talk to her. He cleared his throat. "Hermione? What happened to your writing career?"Hermione was still looking at the small screen. "I wanted to try photography."The truth behind it was that she stopped writing because she doesn't know how to continue the romance novel she was working on. Obviously it was about them, but since he left her, she decided to leave the unfinished book too. After a few months since their wedding, she decided to do things differently. She still loves to read books, but writing wasn't one of her hobbies now. She decided to do another thing she was good at which was photography. Photography relaxes her and captures great moments from other people. Maybe that's where she gets comfort, happiness of other people."Do you own this place?" she heard him ask.Hermione shrugged, still avoiding eye contact. "Almost.""How long have you had this studio?"Hermione glanced at him for a while then back at the camera. "Is this an interview?"Draco kept his mouth shut. She strutted in front of them and handed them some props. She gave Draco a hat with devil's horns."Perfect." She exclaimed. She continued clicking on her camera when she stopped to check the photos on the small screen. "Disgusting." She muttered.Draco heard her and frowned.Hermione smirked. "No, not you. I meant the light was disgusting."But she really meant him.She began to adjust the light with her wand. "We have five more frames left.""Okay, smile!" She said. After the last frame she placed the camera down. "Wait, I didn't date any one of you right?"All eyes were on Draco. Blaise spoke first. "No, you weren't my type. No offense."Hermione pursed her lips. "None taken."Marcus shook his head. Theo nodded but then felt someone smack him again on the head. "Nope."Hermione glanced at Draco. There was silence. She didn't know if he would confess that they dated or not. Draco bit his lip and slowly shook his head.Well, that confirms it.She smirked. "That's good. At least I know I didn't date anyone of you and don't owe an apology or something."The guys, except Draco, gave a forced laugh. Draco knew he was the one who owes her an apology.A few minutes after they left, Ginny came. She rushed to Hermione and gave her a hug."I've just heard what happened. How are you?" She pulled back and checked her friend.Hermione smiled. "I'm fine. Don't worry. I handled it perfectly. Isn't that right, Elena?"Elena nodded. "Yes, Hermione was such a great actress."The girls giggled. Ginny tucked a hair behind her ear. "So, how's the encounter with Draco?"Hermione rolled her eyes and sat down on the couch by the waiting area. "Don't judge me, but he is still good looking. But it doesn't mean I'm forming new feelings for him, no…never. What else? Oh yeah, he actually denied being involved with me."Ginny's mouth dropped."No. What? That slimy bastard. How could he do that? He's such an egotistical, selfish prat." Ginny sat beside her, her face was red as her hair.Hermione sighed and took the camera. She opened the picture of Draco and his friends. "Why did he come back?"Ginny had already calmed herself and then rested her head at the back of the chair. "Maybe he wants something back?" she suggested.Hermione glanced at her friend then back at the small screen. She shut her camera off and placed it beside her. "Nah, I was once fooled by this guy. I won't be fooled again."She stood. "I would never fall in love with this guy ever again." She said as a-matter-of-fact.Ginny gave her a look saying 'Yeah right.'Hermione scoffed. "I'm serious Gin. I'm a different woman now. I repeat. I would never ever fall inlove with Draco Malfoy ever again."Ginny held up her hands and giggled. "Okay okay. I believe you. Let's go to the Burrow. Mum made your favorite dish."Hermione smiled and nodded.To be honest, she wasn't quite sure with what she said. The moment she saw Draco at Flourish and Blotts, all the memories she'd buried in her mind came back again. She never expected to see him. She knew she would see him eventually, but not at that moment when she was just running an errand for Lavander.When she saw him again, she wanted to yell at him, curse him, and ask him a lot of questions she asked herself before. But, at the same time, just the sight of him made her feel alive again. It's like the life that was pulled out from her was with him all along.She hated what she was feeling right now. She's moved on for Merlin's sake. She was at peace and enjoying her new lifestyle. Why does he keep doing this to her? She was finally happy then now he would just come back again and ruin everything? He really was selfish.She could do this. She would show him that she's happy and she doesn't need him in her life. She would just have to control her feelings and emotions. This time, he would play her game. And knowing Draco, he would quit asap."Well, that was something." Blaise sighed as he flopped down the couch. They went back to Draco's place after their 'photo shoot'. Marcus left because he had some work to do.Theo sat on the loveseat beside Draco."So, what would you do with your amnesia girl?" Theo asked, placing his foot on the coffee table."My amnesia girl?" Draco chuckled.Blaise head shot up. "Well, there are a lot of labels to your exes. The French CEO, the-""Okay, I get it." Draco interrupted.He thought about what Theo asked. 'What would he do now?' Draco wasn't sure what he would do next. He doesn't know anything about the new Hermione. What's her likes and dislikes. But, maybe the old Hermione was still inside of her. He sighed.This was his Hermione. Of course he could come up with something. He had let her fall in love with him the first time, he could do it again."I'll just figure something out." He mumbled.He thought some more and he finally had an idea.A/N: I wrote this instead of reviewing for exams. Hahaha. Please review. TY. Review! :D

A/N: Sorry for the late update. My laptop's fucked up, dunno why. Then I have a lot of things to do in school. Anyway, can anyone please tell me how to edit my chapters with proper spacing here in ff? Everytime I upload it is all stuck together, ya'll know what I'm saying? Haha. No matter how many 'enters' I do it still gives the output of one enter. I think I'm not making any sense. Here's the update.Chapter SevenHermione woke up from the strangest dream she ever had. She dreamt that Draco came to visit her on her flat and gave her an ice cream. It was a vanilla flavored ice cream. She accepted it and then it turned into a bouquet of tulips, which appeared to be a wedding bouquet. She looked at herself and noticed she was wearing a wedding gown. She found herself walking down a long aisle. A few minutes later, she was already near the altar, everyone was there except the groom. Draco left her again. She fell for that slimy bastard again. Good thing it was just a dream and good thing she wouldn't fall for that douche again. She gulped. She hopes she wouldn't fall for Malfoy again.She took a shower and got herself dressed. She has a list of photo shoots to do today and thinking about Draco wouldn't help her finish all her work. When she was done, she came down the stairs and saw Ginny grinning."Good morning." Hermione greeted her suspiciously.Ginny glanced to the side and Draco stepped forward, which caused Hermione to lose her balance on the last step. Draco tried to hold her but she placed a hand up to stop him."Good morning Hermione." He greeted her with a smirk."Morning. You're really following me now. How did you know where I live?"Draco glanced at Ginny then back at her. "Someone told me you need help today."Hermione glared at Ginny, who just shrugged and continued to drink her coffee. Her friend has gone mental. It was just yesterday when Ginny was so red when she told about what happened on their studio, and then now, she invited the man that every Gryffindor despised the most in their home. Hermione glanced back at Draco and faked a smile. "No. We don't need your help today. You could go home now."Draco waved his hand. "I know you don't my help. That's why I hired a lot of photographers to do all your work so you have a free schedule today. And, that's odd-" he checked his watch. "I'm free today too! So, I guess we could spend this day together. Don't worry, I've got everything planned."Hermione scoffed and made a beeline to the kitchen. She poured herself some coffee and took a sip. "What makes you think I would go with you? I don't even know you." She glanced at him and gave him a sweet smile.Draco felt his heart flutter. He loves to see her smile. He's been dreaming of it ever since. His lips formed into a small curve. "Because I know you'll love it." Then he suddenly took her hand and quickly apparated her before she could protest. They were now in a dark room."Where are we?" she asked while grasping his arm due to the slight dizziness from side apparition. She couldn't see it, but Draco was grinning from ear to ear."Just wait." He muttered. He snapped his fingers and there was light. Hermione squinted her eyes due to the sudden brightness of the room. When her vision was better, her eyes grew wide, awed by the sight before her.She realized that this was the Library they went together, the Bodleian Library."Bodleian Library." She heard him say as he placed his hand on the small of her back leading her on an aisle.She was still quiet. Though she stopped writing, she never stopped reading books. She loves books. It's her passion, her life. That's what she's known for. She wasn't just in awe of the place, but she was also speechless because she never thought he would still remember this place."I always go here every weekend." He said and pointed to the left. "That is my favorite spot."Hermione glanced to where he was pointing. My spot. She thought."Why is that your favorite spot?" she couldn't help but ask.He smiled. "Because that's where I met the greatest author I've ever known."She faced him. "Who?"Draco shrugged. "Can't tell."She frowned."Okay, okay. Her name is Miss Right."Hermione raised her brow. She doesn't remember meeting anyone who's named Miss Right. "Miss Right?"Draco nodded. "Yeah, and her first name is Always. Miss Always Right" He chortled.Hermione thought for a moment then she got his pity joke. "Miss Always Right my arse." She whispered.He stopped laughing. "What was that?"She smiled sweetly. "Nothing." Then she turned away from him and rolled her eyes. He smiled and lead her to 'his spot'.She remembered how she used to snuggle with him on the floor while they both read in silence. She was tracing the books with her fingers. She was too caught up by the old and new books on the shelves that she didn't noticed Draco taking out a book from the shelf. He stood beside her and opened a certain page. "Hey Hermione, I want to show you something." She turned her head and looked at the book on his left hand and noticed that he was holding a piece of paper on the right.She knew what the book was. It was her favorite book. But she couldn't remember what the piece of paper was. Maybe it was just Draco's scribble notes.Draco sat on his spot while Hermione sat beside him. He sighed. "I've been told once that this is a great book which was written by a great author. Honestly, I thought it was stupid. But- after reading it… I just can't stop." He glanced at her. "And that's why she's Miss Always Right. She was right about this book, she was right about me, she was right about everything. And you know what? I've been reading this over and over again since then.Hermione gave a small smile, blinking tears away. So being called a 'Miss Always Right' was a good thing after all. She was happy she read the book. She thought he would never read, much less even touch it. Her eyes peered to the paper he was holding. "What's that?"Draco looked at the paper on his hand. "It's a letter. But it's private. There's a spell in it so you can't read it."Hermione rolled her eyes and started to stand up when she felt his hand on her arm. "I was just kidding." He laughed. She looked at his arm then to his face. He was still grinning. She pried her arm and folded her arms as she sat beside him.Draco felt a slight pang on his chest when she took her arm away. She was really different now. But he can't blame her. He knew nothing could compare to the pain he'd caused her before."This is a letter written by Miss Right. I knew she secretly placed it on my coat. She has no idea that I've read it though. Every time I start and finish the book, I read it." He said as he slowly and carefully unfolded the letter. He handed it to her.She was confused. She can't remember writing a letter to him. Maybe she has amnesia. She laughed at herself. She doesn't have amnesia. She just didn't try to remember any memories associated with Draco. She took the paper and read it. Then she remembered. That was the time they had a fight about the book.It readTo my dearest Draco,I love you and I'm sorry. I know you don't like the book and I kept forcing you to read it. I just hope someday you would give it a chance. This book inspired me in so many ways I can't imagine. This is how I believe in love, in our love and the change that could enact with this love. Don't worry. Someday, I'll write a romance novel that you would read every day. And you know why? Because it would be our love story.LoveShe didn't know why her name wasn't written there. She knew she wrote her name, it was also her handwriting. She gave it back to him, stood and walked away. She felt tears forming her eyes and she doesn't want to give him the satisfaction seeing her cry. It would show him that he still had impact in her life and that she was weak. Well she isn't. She just hated what she felt at the moment. Pain.This is the time when all those happy memories would appear, then what? Nothing. It would just lead to an annoying question…'What if?' She knew what he was trying to do. He was trying to bring all those happy memories back because he thinks that that Hermione would fall in love with him again. Well, sorry to say, but she wouldn't let you in her heart again.Draco sighed and whispered a spell. Her name slowly appeared. He charmed it so she wouldn't see that it was from her. He knew that if she saw her own name, she would be confused and it might scare her. It would lead to a lot of questions and it would force him to say things at the moment which he couldn't say now. He was also quite unsure what he could say.If he wants her back, he would start over again, no matter how hard it is… just as long as she would be his again. He knew this time, he was sure. He placed the letter back inside the book and charmed it once again so only he could see it. He placed it back on the shelf and looked for her.He searched everywhere. He remembered she found him outside when they fought. He went out and she was nowhere to be found.Hermione didn't apparate back at her flat because Ginny might be there and Draco would find her there. She went back to their studio at Diagon Alley.To her relief, no one was there.She opened the drawer on her desk. She took out all her things and pushed a small handle inside, opening a hidden drawer.She took out the medium-sized, red leather notebook. She whispered a password and the lock gave a small click once it opened. She flipped the pages and found the page where she tore the letter. He read it. She thought he wouldn't find it in his coat. Then again, she was wrong. She shouldn't be called Miss Right.She felt a tear ran down her cheek. She quickly wiped it with the back of her hand and breathed.No. No more tears.She took her wand and cleaned up all the things in her desk, including the red notebook in the hidden drawer. She hid her face in her palm and sighed out loud. Her head shot up as soon as she heard someone open the door."Hey, I thought you have this thing with Malfoy?""I left early. Why are you here Harry? Where's Gin?"Harry walked to her desk and noticed the redness in her eyes. "What happened? Did he hurt you?" He felt his blood start to boil.She couldn't stop another set of tears to form her eyes. "A year ago, yes. Now, no. I'm fine Harry. You don't have to worry."Harry still wasn't convinced, but he would deal with Malfoy another time. He sat on her desk. "I told you 'Mione, you should just tell him the truth before it's too late."Hermione stood and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "I will, but not now. This is nothing."She darted towards the door giving one last glance at him, giving him a small smile. "I just need to know something, and when I do, I'll tell him the truth." She opened the door and left.Harry sighed. "Always as stubborn as ever."A/N: PLEASE REVIEW. Hahaha. Reviews from all of you inspire me to continue this fic. Haha. I might change it from the movie. Maybe a little of this and a little of that, just MAYBE. I have chapter eight already. Hopefully, my laptop would be okay. Thanks for the reviews and viewers. REVIEW.

A/N: Sorry for the VERY late update. I've changed some things but some I let it stay as it is because it is just so perfect. Thanks for the review. Please review again.Chapter eightDraco was drinking a glass of scotch in Theo's Manor. He went straight there because he couldn't find Hermione anywhere. He first searched the studio in London, she wasn't there. Next he went back to her flat, knocked and no answer. He went to her studio in Diagon Alley, but it was closed.He was feeling the burning amber liquid down on his throat, all confused and distracted. He can't understand why she just left. He thought it was a great idea, since she loves books and she once told him it was her favorite library besides the one they had in Hogwarts. Maybe she really has changed. He sighed.Of all places in the world, he brought her to an old Library. Now the new Hermione would think of him as an old fashioned, boring guy. He cringed at that thought.Theo was just pouring him his other round of scotch when Draco stood abruptly. "That's right. Why didn't I think of it before?"He quickly went to the floo and went to his manor leaving Theo confused. He hoped this would work. In order to know the new Hermione, he had to ask someone who knows her more than anyone else.The next day, Draco went over to the Ministry. He took the lift and muttered the place he was going. Once the lift stopped, he walked towards a small corridor and turned left. He saw an oak door on the end of the corridor and knocked."Come in." said a voice from behind the door.He turned the knob and entered."Malfoy?""Yes, Potter.""What are you doing here?" Harry glared at him, and peered his eyes to his wand at the desk."I-I want to ask about Hermione."Harry shook his head. "There's nothing much to say here."Draco took a seat in front of Harry's desk, not minding the death glare from the boy who lived."What happened to her? How come she remembers all of you but not me and my friends?"Harry snorted. "It's an obvious answer. We were still there for her after you left."Draco looked down. That memory always haunted him in his dreams. It always reminded him of the biggest regret he ever made. "That's why I want to make it up to her."Harry frowned. "No Malfoy. You've done enough damage already. This time, I won't let you hurt her again. Now leave."Draco clenches his jaw, stood and headed to the door. He stopped as he held the knob, his back still facing Harry. "You know, I would never give up. No one, not even you could stop me from getting her back." He turned the knob and left.Harry rolled his eyes and leaned to his chair. He took his phone and pressed a button. "Hi love…Malfoy was just here…I think he'll come to you next…No, I didn't say anything…Yes, I'm sure…Yes, I ate already. You? Okay…See you too…I love you too."Draco dusted off his sleeve once he apparated in an alley. He walked to the pavement and turned to his right to Hermione's studio. He opened the door and heard the small bell ring. He was disappointed not to see Hermione anywhere, but then remembered she's not suppose to see him today. The person he really needs to talk to right now is the red little weaslette.He ignored the secretary behind the desk and headed straight to the weaslette was."I know Potter told you I was coming."Ginny was fixing some photos on the large long table. "Can you please hand me that folder on that coffee table?" she asked without looking up at him.Draco raised his brow but did what he was told. That was strange, but he needed her help if he want to get Hermione back. Ginny thanked him."Now, I want to ask about Hermione." He looked determined, placing his hands on the desk. He was on the other side across Ginny.Ginny glanced at him for a second then back to her work. "And? What about her?"Draco brushed his hair with his hand in frustration. "Everything about her. What she likes, hobbies. Favorite food, color. Anything. She had an amnesia and I don't know what she likes or wants." He sighed.Ginny peered her eyes to him, placing her hands on her hips. "What if I told you she wants you to leave her alone?"Ouch. He felt a punch on his gut. He found it hard to swallow. He knew that part was true, but he doesn't care. He would do anything to change that. He would accept that pain because he knew he deserves it.Ginny sighed. "You know, I really can't help you with that. You could do that on your own."He ran a hand again on his hair. He really looked desperate. "Please? Just tell me one thing about her."She pursed her lips. "She hasn't change. She's still the same. She doesn't want a perfect guy, Malfoy."He gave a loud sigh and nodded. He knew her friends wouldn't help him. Why would they? The only thing they would do to him is to kill him right now. He was about to leave when he heard her speak. "One more thing, we have this photo shoot tomorrow. I think you could help her since I would be on another site."Draco glanced back, his lips curved slightly. "Thanks."Ginny shrugged and continued with her work.Hermione woke up feeling so much better than she had for the past few days. She has finally made her decision and that is to never see Draco again. She is erasing all the unwanted drama out of her life because at the end of the day, all she's trying to do is to be happy. She was satisfied with her thought. She would just take more projects outside the studio.She stood and showered, got dressed and ready for the photo shoot she would take on the park.She took her things and ran to her car which was parked outside. She was checking her things on her bag when she bumped into someone.She glanced up and her eyes grew wide.Shit. So much for erasing the drama."Good morning, Hermione. You will be in need of my help today. Draco Malfoy, at your service." Draco said while taking her things to place them in the back seat.Hermione frowned. "Let me guess – Ginny?"Draco ignored her and opened the passenger's seat. "After you, beautiful."Hermione placed on a fake smile and sat down, folding her arms. Draco smiled and waltzed to the other side of the car. He sat down on the driver's seat. Draco beamed at her and started the car. Hermione glanced at him. "Let's go. My clients are waiting."Draco started to drive. He learned how to drive after Hogwarts. Since they stayed in Muggle France after the war, he started to build his business and been acquainted to some Muggle businessmen. Since he's been hanging out with some of them, he was introduced with a new hobby called 'car racing'."Don't you have your own work to do?" she asked.Draco grinned. "I own my company, Granger. I could do whatever I like."Hermione rolled her eyes.They were both silent for the rest of their drive to the park. When they've reached their destination, Hermione went out leaving Draco carrying all the tripods and whatnots. He didn't mind. He was actually happy that he was with her right now. He wanted to show her that he was a good guy, fun to hang out with and someone who could help her in any situation. And of course, as long as he get to spend this day with her, he's all good.Hermione looked around and saw that the people were all dressed in gowns and tux. Somewhere deep inside her had a feeling what this family portrait is. Draco, who was trailing behind her, had the same thought as her.A woman, who was in her forty's , came to greet her. She took Hermione's hand and shook it gently. "Hello Miss Granger, I'm Holly Johnson. Please call me Holly. I'm the one who called Ginny yesterday."Hermione smiled. "It's a pleasure to meet you."She pointed the people around. "Why are they in gowns and tux? I thought it was just a casual family portrait?"Holly nodded. "Yes it is, but today is also my parent's golden wedding anniversary. It would be nice to take photos of how much they love each other after all those years."Hermione's smile froze. "I'm sorry, but I think I've mixed up my schedule with my friend. I just have to make this call. Excuse me." She turned to face him. "Draco, stay here."Draco was out of earshot during their conversation, but mumbled an 'okay, I'll stay' as she ordered him to stay. He was still distracted by all the people around them. He spotted an old man playing with his grand children while the old woman beside him was having her makeup done by what seemed to be as one of their daughters.He turned his head and saw Hermione near the lake talking to someone on the phone. She looks angry.Hermione tucked a stray hair on her ear. "Gin, I didn't know you assigned me in a wedding photo shoot. You know how much I hate weddings.""I didn't know it was a wedding 'Mione. I'm sorry. Just do this shoot and go home after."Hermione closed her eyes briefly and opened it again. She spotted Draco looking at her, she looked away. "Fine. But you owe me one. You invited the bastard on this shoot. It just made it worst.""Really? He came?" Ginny sound amused."Gin" she warned."Okay, fine. I'll do your job for the rest of the week.""One month. You owe me that much.""Fine.""Fine."And she pressed the end button. She went back to where the woman was. "Okay, let's start." She glanced back and can't find Draco anywhere.Hermione told Holly to gather everyone on the garden. She started to look for Draco. She went to the playground and he wasn't there. She looked at all the gazebos and still no sign of him. She closed her eyes. He was causing her too much stress already. She walked back to the site and took her camera. She felt someone tap her shoulder and she jerked her head to the side and saw a white calla lily in front of her. She took a step back. Draco took her hand and placed the flower on her hand. Hermione was still staring at him.She purposely dropped the flower on the ground and cleared her throat. "Where have you been? You're causing too much delay. Remember the part where you said you would stay? Well you sucked at that."She may have told it with double meaning. She could see his eyes grew wide then eventually became soft. He took a step closer, ignoring the flower on the ground. "I'm sorry. I promise to stay this time." He whispered.Hermione felt like there was a lump on her throat. She looked away "Get the reflector." And off again she went to the old couple standing near the lake.Draco's lip twitched a little. He really meant what he said. He would stay with her and this time he would never leave, not just in this shoot, but forever.Hermione waved a hand at him indicating to hurry up and he obediently ran to where she was. He knelt in front of her and held out the reflector.The old couple embraced each other and smiled at the camera. Hermione clicked her camera. She looked at the small screen and saw how much happy the couples were. It made her realized that someone could love you forever. She felt tears prickling her eyes. This could've been them if they got married. She took a deep breath. "Draco, move back. The light isn't good." Her voice was shaky.Draco stood and stayed behind her."More, Draco. Move way back." She said not glancing back at him.He took a few steps back again."Move Draco. Bloody hell, can't you understand? Move. Over there." She snarled, still not looking at him.Draco took more steps behind and he was already too far from the couple. He knitted his brows. "Does this still have an effect?"She turned her head to face him. He wouldn't see her eyes brimming with tears. She felt her voice break. "Yes, it still has." She swallowed. "It still has." She whispered.She wasn't pertaining to the light. She meant him. This entire thing still has an effect on her. It still brings pain to her heart. She can't do this with him just kneeling or standing beside her. She needed him to be away from her, and she meant it literally. This whole shoot reminds her of what would've been if they got married. She looked down and faced the couples again, wiping the tears away with her palm."I'm sorry." She took a deep breath and sighed. "You guys just really touched my heart. It's such a lovely sight to see you both married for years and still love each other that much."The couple smiled wider. "One day you'll find your soul mate." The woman said.Hermione smiled softly. "I hope so. Okay. We have a few more frames to do."When they were done with the shoot, Hermione took her things and darted to the car. Draco was trying to help her with all the bags but she pried her arm away. "I can do it." Her voice flat."No, let me help you." He insisted."I said I would do it."Rain suddenly poured down. "Hermione, go to that gazebo."She still went ahead to where the car was. She wanted to get out of here."Hermione, your camera would get wet."Hermione stopped and realized that she's been using the camera bag to cover her head. Shit. The pictures were still in there.She turned to her right and ran to the gazebo. She placed her bags on the bench and wiped her arm and face with her hand. She was really in a bad mood and now they would be staying in the gazebo for a while until the rain stops which just made her mood worst.Draco noticed that she was in a foul mood as he quietly placed the rest of the things on the small table. He handed her his handkerchief. "Here."She pushed his hand away. "No thanks." She turned away from him, scowling. This really was the worst day ever. First, Draco going with her to work. Second, the unexpected photo shoot. Third, Draco being on this photo shoot, who by the way, caused her the allergy she had with weddings. Lastly, being stuck here in the gazebo with Draco.Draco placed his handkerchief back on his pocket. He hesitated for a moment, but then decided it was best to ask her. "Did I do something wrong?"Hermione stiffened. She turned to face him. She bit her tongue, trying to stop herself from saying anything. She wanted to punch him right now. Her head was screaming 'Yes, you bastard. You did the worst thing a person would do.'She pursed her lips. "Nothing." She sighed and took a seat on the bench. "I just remembered what my friends told me."It was Draco's turn to stiffen. His eyes wide and he felt his pulse quicken. He sat beside her, worried at what her Gryffindor friends have told her. "Really? A-about what?" he stuttered.She glanced at him. "I was supposed to get married. But the groom left me in the aisle."He swallowed and found it hard to look at her in the eye. He nervously played with his fingers. "R-really? Did they tell you who the guy was?"She shrugged. "I don't know.""No name?"She waved a hand. "They didn't bother telling me. They said I might kill him if I knew his name."He could feel his heart pounding rapidly. This is the time when he would finally hear it from her. He would finally see what she felt about it. "No pictures?""None. They burned it all so I won't remember anything about him." She said nonchalantly.She sighed and glanced at him. "What kind of person would do such a thing? And to think he knew I'm already alone because my parents died. For years I've prayed that I would find someone that I could be with for the rest of my life." She blinked a few tears away. Draco could only gaze at her, wide eyed."They said I was very happy that time. It was a lovely day. The sun was bright with clear blue sky. They said I was a very beautiful and glowing bride to a perfect groom to a perfect wedding. Everything was just so magical."She looked down at her feet. "But I was wrong. When the groom left, I hid behind the altar. That's where I cried my eyes out." Tears were now pooling her eyes and she had to stop it from falling. She quickly wiped it with her palm.He felt a pang on his chest. This was the part he really didn't know. This was the part he wished he knew but was too coward to face it.Hermione continued. "They said I've waited. They told me it's time to leave. Ron even tried to pull me home but I said 'No.' they said I said 'No. I'll wait for him. He'll come back. He might've forgotten something.' I also said 'He would never do this to me.'" Tears were flowing freely down to her cheeks. She doesn't care if Draco could see it. She inhaled sharply. "But I was wrong again. He never came back."She let out some air and tucked her hair behind her ears. She glanced back at him. "It was night time and rain started to fall, very cliché. I ran far away from the church and crossed the road, not minding all the cars passing by." She cleared her throat and looked away from him.Draco clenched his jaw and looked away too. He was ashamed of himself. He caused her too much problems and heart aches. He was the reason she got an accident. He was the reason why she can't remember anything. He was startled from his reverie when she heard her speak."Good thing I had an accident. It's funny how much it still hurts, you know, I have amnesia and don't remember it in my own view, and yet it still has this impact in me." She wiped another tear in her eye and glanced at him again. "Why?"He turned to face her.Hermione gaze at his eyes. "I mean – Why did he do that to me? You told me I was beautiful, smart and funny. Why would he still leave me?" She really wanted to know. The question of 'Why' has been haunting her for a long time.Draco swallowed, he don't know what to say. He himself doesn't know why he left either. He didn't think they would have this conversation now. He didn't know she would open this up to him. He stuttered. "Maybe he was scared.""That's fucked up. That's his only reason?" she snarled.Draco ran his hand through his hair and shifted from his seat to face her. "Maybe he felt that he rushed things."Hermione snorted. "Then he's stupid. Why did he propose to me when he wasn't ready?"He sighed. "I'm sure he had a lot of reasons. Even I would be scared.""Scared of what?" she snapped.He looked down at his fingers then glanced back up to her. "Of you.""Of me?" she scoffed. "So what? It's my fault now?"Draco shook his head. "No. I – He might be scared for you. That you might get hurt more if he continued the wedding."Hermione gritted her teeth. "That's bullshit. Why? Does he think I'm not hurting right now?"He felt a punch on his gut. She was right. "Maybe he had a lot of questions before. What if it would always be the two of you? If it would always be the two of you, he might lose himself. If he said yes before, could he really stand up for it?"Hermione was pursing her lips. "What? Was his question answered when he left?"Draco looked directly in her eyes. All those time he already knew the answer to his question. He was just blind and stupid to see it. "He realized that he can't do it without you. He can't go on with his life without you. Hermione, I'm sure wherever this guys is, he regretted the day he left you – that he hurt you. But if this guy is in front of you right now, I'm sure he would only ask one thing from you, and that would be for you to forgive him." He sighed, not breaking his gaze. "I'm sorry Hermione, I was a coward."Hermione's lips were trembling. She looked away and let her tears flow freely from her eyes. Hearing all of these was like putting a bandage to a wound. She had waited for this day, and now it was here. She finally heard his part. The last thing he said was still ringing in her head. I'm sorry Hermione, I was a coward.Draco looked down. He finally said what he was longing to say a year ago. He knew well what was deep in his heart but was just too stubborn to admit it. He felt that some weight was lifted from his shoulder now that he said all these things to her. He glanced at her and saw her shaking, her back facing his. Without hesitation, he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her closer to him. She stiffened but seems to relax after a while. He felt the warmth of her body against his. He didn't mutter any words but just massage her arm with his hand.She missed this, his arm around hers. She was longing for this before and if she was still that same broken Hermione, she would've loved this. But now, she's moved on. She remembered that this wasn't supposed to happen, she should stop this now. She struggled from her seat and pushed herself away from him.No. She wouldn't be fooled again, not now not ever.A/N: Lighter note in the next few chapters. Hope you liked it. Thanks for those who reviewed but please review again. Thanks ya'll.

A/N: Sorry for the very late upload, AGAIN. My laptop was sick so I had to bring it to the doctor. But now it's functioning well again. Then another problem came, I don't have internet connection. So it took some time for me to upload this chapter. I can't save this as pdf, dunno why. Anyway, I read some of my chapters and noticed some wrong grammars and typo errors. I usually don't re-read them as I type because I just write non-stop. I just go with the flow and I want to upload it asap. Don't want to keep you guys waiting. Haha. Anyway, thanks for the reviews and PLEASE review again. I was inspired by some songs and I'll mention the title later and they are in italic bold. REVIEW! Thanks.Chapter 9Hermione was staring at her ceiling, deep in thought. For almost over a year she always asked herself 'Why?' And now, she finally had an answer.She turned to face her side, pulling the covers closer to her.Was his answer enough?He said that he realized he couldn't live without her. He said he was just a coward. Once those words were out of his mouth, she felt like a needle was pulled out of her heart. But does that mean she has forgiven him? Just like that, and everything he did was forgotten?Sorry doesn't change the past nor does it heal a broken heart. It doesn't fix anything. What's good in sorry?Maybe Harry was right. Pretending to have amnesia was a bad idea. But then again, if she didn't pretend, he wouldn't say anything to her. She would never get the answer she wanted to hear.Now she's all tangled up. She's torn between forgiving him or not. Forgetting and letting go. Maybe it's time to finally move on. Maybe she just needed to hear his side of the story so she would finally have peace in her heart. Yes, maybe it is just for closure.She tried to close her eyes to sleep but the events that had happened in the park kept repeating in her mind.oOoOoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOThe next day Hermione was feeling restless. She wasn't able to sleep fully because a man with platinum blonde hair and grey eyes were haunting her dreams. She dragged herself away from her bed and went to the bathroom to get ready for another ordinary day.She went down to the kitchen and saw Ginny eating some pancakes at the breakfast bar. She looked around checking if someone else in the room.Ginny sipped on her cup of coffee. "I'm the only one here.""What?" Hermione scoffed. "You think I'm expecting someone else?"Ginny just rolled her eyes and took one last bite of her pancake. Once she was finished, she cleaned her plate and cup in the sink. Hermione helped herself with her own coffee and some bagel. She sat on the breakfast bar Ginny vacated and started to eat.Ginny was drying her hand with the kitchen towel when she turned to face Hermione. "I'm off. So much work to do." She gave Hermione a 'you-know-why-I-have-so-a-lot-of-work' look.Hermione grinned and waved her hand to send her off. She continued to eat her bagel and can't help the feeling of disappointment that Draco isn't around. She should be happy that he's finally gone and won't be bugging her every minute of every day. She also did have the chance to tell him what she really felt and what had happened after he left (all were true except the part of the accident). She should be at ease now.After her last sip of coffee, she started to clean the kitchen. It would help her distract herself of thoughts about her conversation with Draco in the park and since Ginny would do most of her work, she could take her time to do other things and just go to the studio for some shoots from walk-in clients.She was on her way to work and still can't take her mind off of Draco. She turned the radio on and heard a beautiful song starting to surround her. There was a soft strumming of the guitar and then a female voice began to sing. Her lips curved a little because it fitted perfectly with her feelings right now.''Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.'Yes, now it has finally ended, right? They finally had the closure they needed. Now that they've heard each side, it's finally over.'And we know it's never simple never easy.'But why does she have a feeling like she doesn't want it to be over? She feels like she can't let him go. Has she always felt that way and was just too stubborn to admit it? Was it the reason why no guy could ever be good enough for her? She had a perfect guy once, scratch that, he wasn't perfect. He was a coward. How can she be sure that this time he won't do the same thing again? She gave out a loud sigh.Why do I have to think about these things? This is just a waste of time. He's finally gone, Hermione. Now is the time to move on. You should be celebrating right now. She thought to herself.The music still filled her car.'People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out. Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.'Yes, it's time to finally close the book with Draco. Maybe this happened because they weren't meant to be together. She felt a pang on her chest with that thought. But it was the truth; fate proved them that they were just two different people that can never be together for the rest of their lives.And yet… she stepped on the break in time with the stop light. 'I can't breathe without you but I have to.'Draco brought the spark in her world. Being with him made her feel alive and when he left, she felt like she was lost in darkness. She felt lonely and cold. She tried her very best to forget, doing a lot of work to keep herself busy… but at night, when she was about to sleep, memories of Draco still haunted her dreams.The feeling she had when she saw him again in Flourish and Blotts after almost sixteen months was indescribable. It was a mixture of surprised, fear, anger, hurt, anxiousness, sadness and love.She stepped on the gas again when the light turned green. She has to stop thinking now. She's like Eve being tempted by the serpent to eat the apple. Draco the serpent and the apple is…love?She's too hurt to know if it's love she's feeling. Maybe she's just in love with the idea of being with Draco but not really love, like she loves Draco or something. Her feelings towards him were still too complicated for her to understand.'I'm sorry, I'm sorry…""I'm so sorry Draco." She whispered. "I think I'm not ready to love you again."She felt a tear flow down her cheek. She wiped it immediately with her hand because she just reached the building were her studio is located. She took a deep breath and checked herself in the mirror. "No more, Hermione Granger. You've cried enough." She whispered.oOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oShe opened the door and saw Elena smiling at her like she always does. "Good morning, Hermione.""Good morning, Elena.""Ginny left already for a birthday shoot."Hermione nodded. She waited for a while incase Elena would say anything about Draco dropping by or leaving a message but nothing came.She strutted her way to her office. She opened the door and saw it was full of tulips with different colors. Yellow, blue, red, pink, you name it. She craned her neck around and noticed it doesn't have her favorite color. She walked to the middle of her office, tracing her fingers in each tulip in her way. They are real!She was beside her desk when she noticed an envelope on top of it. It has her name on it, written in an elegant script with golden ink. She tore it open and there was a card inside.It read:I've once known a girl who has a very odd taste in color. Though, right now, I don't know if she still likes that color so I'll give her all colors that exist in this world. I hope she would pick one and I hope she would give me a chance to get to know her more.She knew who owned that hand writing. She smiled and took one yellow tulip."So I guess yellow is your favorite color?" She heard a voice behind her.She turned around and saw Draco smirking. She blushed and placed the tulip back to where it was originally placed."So I guess you did all of this?" She replied, trying to keep a flat voice.Draco nodded and looked down. "I knew you didn't like the Calla Lilies I gave you yesterday so you threw it away – and before, you used to like tulips. I was hoping you still like them." He glanced back at her.Hermione silently gasped. She can't believe he remembered that her favorite flower is tulips. She looked around once more to see if her favorite color was there but failed to see one. Maybe he didn't remember that part."I took all the tulips I could find, of course some were colored magically." A slight blush formed his cheek. "I don't know what color you like, but here –"he took a step closer to her and took out a single white tulip from his back. It has a silver and green ribbon on its stem. "- I hope you like this one."Hermione blushed. He does remember her favorite color.She took the tulip from his grasp. "Thanks." She whispered and placed the tulip near her nose. She smiled. "White. My favorite color."Draco grinned. "I thought so."She gazed at the flower and glanced at him. "Why did you do this?"Draco ran his hand through his hair. "I want to start all over again. I mean, I want to get to know you, I want you to get to know me, all those stuff."Hermione looked at the white tulip in awe. "It would be nice to have a friend like you." She lied.Draco clenched his jaw. He was hoping to be more than that, but he doesn't want to scare her by rushing things. He would accept friendship…for now."Yes, as friends." He said in a soft voice.Hermione gave a small smile. Honestly, she may want to work things out with him but she wasn't sure. She might just be too happy to think that way. She should decide when she was in a normal state and probably alone in her office. She's between wanting more or none at all.She cleared her throat. "No work today Malfoy?"He smiled sheepishly. "Nope." He pointed at himself. "Boss."She smiled and shook her head. "I'm a boss too but still work my arse off."Draco smirked. "Yeah, I heard Ginny would do your work for a month."Hermione gaped at him. "Well – it's because she owes me."Draco raised his brow. "May I ask why Ginny owes you one?"She bit her lip and looked away from his gaze. She can't tell him it was because of the wedding/family photo shoot and the fact that he was there.Time to use that big brain of yours Miss Granger. She thought.Draco was still gazing at her, waiting for her reply.Hermione carefully placed the white tulip on her desk. "It's none of your business, Malfoy. If you're not busy, then go to your friends and don't disturb a person who works for a living."He smirked. "But I want my photo taken today."She cocked her head to the side. "Really? What for?""For a special girl, my girlfriend." He said as a-matter-of-factly.She stiffened. She didn't know he had a girlfriend. "Oh. I see. Let's go."She passed by him and headed towards the studio. He followed.Why are you affected, Hermione? You should be happy that Draco won't be bugging you anymore because he's finally moved on. You should do the same courtesy as him.She took her camera and magically turned the background black. She conjured a white modern chair in the middle. "Sit there." She ordered, without looking at him.He did as he was told and sat down.She took her camera and peeked through the eyepiece. She could see his beautiful face and those striking grey eyes. She adjusted the lens to zoom in further and to have a clearer view. He still has this great jaw line. His lips were still soft looking. She blushed. "So, who is this girlfriend?" Her eyes grew wide. She didn't mean to ask it out loud.It seems like Draco was surprised as well at her bluntness. "Erm- actually, she's not yet my girlfriend."She clicked the button and looked at the small monitor of the camera. "Oh? Why call her your girlfriend then?"He shifted at his seat. "Because I want to think that she's already mine."Hermione looked up to face him and frowned. "That's very stupid of you Draco. What if she doesn't want to be yours? You'll end up waiting for nothing and just hurt yourself when you could just find another one." Or be with me again. She mentally smacked her head from that absurd thought. Shut up already, Hermione.Draco gave a sad smile. "I know. But that's a risk I would gladly take. I would accept all the pain for her."Hermione looked back at the camera again and took another shot. "You would do that for a girl?"She can't explain why she was jealous and failed to hide the bitterness in her tone.Draco nodded. "Yes, I would do anything for her. I did wrong things in my past relationship. I don't want to do the same mistakes again. I've learned. I've grown. I know that this girl is the one for me."Hermione clicked her camera again and looked at the monitor. Damn, he's photogenic. She walked to where the light stand was and shakily adjusted it. It slipped through her finger and fell on the floor. Draco stood and helped her."Let me help you." He muttered. She stepped aside and went back to where she was standing a minute ago. She didn't want to argue with him right now, she's too confused already with her emotions right now. Why was she feeling hurt? Can't she just be happy for him?"So, who is this girl?" She was really curious.Draco finished fixing the light and turned to face her. "You don't know her. She's someone I knew before.""What's her name?"He smirked and began to open his mouth when he heard his phone ring. He took his phone from his pocket. He excused himself and walked to the corner of the studio.Hermione pursed her lips and played with her camera. She was switching from foot to foot and can't help but steal glances at Draco. She took a photo of him while he was talking on his phone.He began to smile, she clicked again. He chuckled, click. He was now facing her so she stopped and placed her camera down. She turned around and sat on the chair Draco vacated.Maybe he was talking to his new girl. She frowned. She's starting to get annoyed with her thoughts.She was pulled out from her reverie when she heard his footsteps come closer."Sorry, Hermione, but I have to go. I'll come back for the photos."She shrugged. "Sure. I'll tell Elena to call you if it's ready."Draco held his hand. "Thank you."She gazed at his hand then up at his face. "For what?"He smirked. "For the photos."She blushed and took his hand, giving it a single shake. "No problem."He gave her hand one last squeeze and finally let go. "Have a great day Hermione." He turned on his heel and left.Hermione's eyes followed him as he slowly left her studio. He's been acting strange, and when she meant with strange, she meant like he's okay…like nothing happened yesterday. She couldn't help but feel a tad bit of disappointment which made her even more confused.Maybe she assumed that now that he heard her side, he would open up to her and tell her that he was the groom. Maybe she also expected that he would do grand gestures to show her how truly sorry he was.She took her camera and saw his face on the monitor. He was looking at her. Those grey eyes that used to gaze at her every day. Those eyes that used to love her and, sometimes, glare at her for her clumsiness. She pressed the button to turn her camera off. She'll just let Elena develop his pictures for her.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooHer office was cleared now, all the tulips were magically transferred to Molly Weasley's garden. She only kept the white tulip, which she placed in a small vase.There was a tap on her window. It was Errol, the Weasley's clumsy but adorable owl. She opened the window to let him in and he flew right to her desk. She gave him some seeds and noticed a note tied to its leg. She took it, it was from Molly.Hermione, darling, thank you for the flowers. They are absolutely lovely. Make sure to visit the Burrow soon.Love, MollyShe took a small parchment and wrote a reply.You're very much welcome. Will visit soon.Love, HermioneShe placed the note on Errol's leg and he started to fly away.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooShe bid good bye to Elena. It was nearly six in the evening. She walked out the studio and saw Draco standing outside causing her to stop mid-way on her steps. "Why are you here?"Draco grinned. "I took the photos. They are very good."Hermione folded her arms. "You could give it to this special girl then." She bit her tongue. Can't she just shut up?He ran his hand through his hair and sighed. "I can't give it to her yet. I don't even know if I could give it to her."She cocked her head to the side. "Why not?"Draco's lips curved. "Are you busy tonight? Let's have dinner."She blinked a few times due to his sudden change of subject. Well, he sure doesn't want to talk about his relationship with her. Why would he? And besides, it would be very awkward. She should put her nose out of his business.Before she could say 'no' he led her to his car.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooIt was silent all on their way to their destination. Hermione took quick glances at him and she could see from the corner of her eye that he was doing the same thing. He was tapping his fingers on the steering wheel.She cleared her throat. "This is kidnapping, you know?"He chuckled. "Kidnapping? What's that? Such a funny word."She giggled. "Never mind."Draco glanced at her then back at the road. He smiled "Want some music?'She shrugged.He pressed the button on his radio and a song started to surround them. She recognized the song and began to tap her fingers along the beat."Where are we going?" she asked.Draco turned the steering wheel to the right. "It's a surprise."She formed a small 'o' on her lips and glanced back at the window. She could see some people walking and others were inside small bistros, drinking wine and having a comfortable conversation with their company.Her mind started to wander way back when she and Draco were dating. It would always be like this, he would collect her from work and they would eat dinner at a fine dining restaurant. He would also have some surprises, big or small, on his sleeve. She smiled sadly at those memories.What if – no, Hermione, don't even go there. Enough with the 'What if we did get married?' and all those questions. It's just a waste of time. It would never happen. Stop thinking already.She heard the woman sing. 'Let the love love love begin…'She was quiet the whole time, so was Draco. She kept staring at the window that she didn't notice that they stopped.He opened the door for her and held out his hand. She took it and stepped out of the car.Hermione looked around. It was dark and only a street light and some small Christmas lights illuminated the way. There was a small iron gate which was covered with vines.He placed his hand on the small of her back and led her inside. They were walking through a small path with tall bushes surrounding them. They turned left and then after a few steps, right. It was as if they were in a labyrinth. By the time they turned left again, she spotted a small, but elegant restaurant.They both entered and were greeted by a raven haired girl. She thanked Merlin she was wearing a skirt today so she wouldn't seem under-dressed.The girl was blushing the whole time while talking to Draco. Hermione couldn't help but roll her eyes. Oh, who wouldn't forget the girls who fawn over Draco?They were led to an almost secluded area where they had the most excellent view of the garden outside. There were two chairs and a table covered with white cloth. A small candle light in the middle which was surrounded by tulips. She smiled.Draco pulled out the chair for her. She thanked him and sat down. Once they were both settled, Hermione looked anywhere but him. From the large window, she could see the beautiful night sky which was blanketed with stars and the thing that outstands is the bright full moon.Looking down, she saw the labyrinth they walked into and the garden on the other side. There was a huge fountain and a lot of flowers, different flowers surrounding it. She started to hear soft music around them.Draco was gazing at her. Her beauty was still the same as ever. She really is a beautiful woman. He was glad she came with him tonight. He was glad his plans were working."I ordered for the both of us already, if that's okay with you. We could just order again if you won't like it." He muttered.Hermione glanced at him. "Okay."Their food came and they were both quiet the whole time. The food was really delicious. Most of them were her favorite dishes. He remembers what she likes, and when the waiter suggested a certain dish, Draco refused because he knew she was allergic to it. She was smiling inside, in awe that he still knew her that well and yet she avoided any eye contact with him. She could feel his gaze at her the whole time.Dessert came and when she took her last bite of chocolate cake she placed her fork down and took a sip of her champagne. Draco too, was finished with his cake and sipped from his glass, still gazing at the woman in front of him.She was feeling very uncomfortable with his gaze. It's as if he is trying to read his mind and would know she was just faking her amnesia. They heard the band started to play inside. She could see a young man standing in front of the small stage and started to sing. They could hear the song from their area.Draco stood and held out his hand. "Dance with me."She hesitated at first but finally gave in. She stood and felt his hand on her back, leading her a few steps away from their table.He pulled her closer. She could smell him. It was still the same smell he had. That musk, sexy Draco smell he always had. She gently placed her hand on his arm and felt his muscles. She glanced up at him and saw he was looking at her."You look lovely, Hermione." His voice was soft.She felt butterflies flutter in her stomach. She bit her lip and looked away. "This girl of yours might be looking for you already. We should go."He held her closer. "Let's not talk about her. And besides, she isn't looking for me. It might be the other way around."She perked her head up to look at him and frowned. "What do you mean?"Draco smiled. "Let's just enjoy this night."She hates it when he changes the topic but chose to ignore it…for now. They continued to dance until there was a change in music. She thought they would stop dancing but he held her closer.She was stiff for a moment, not knowing whether she should pull away or wrap her arms around him. She began to listen to the lyrics. She haven't heard this song, nor does she know who sang it, but the message it brought really touched her'I may havemay have run out of songs to singI may have run out of words to saybut all that I want you to know is what I feel for you:'And to her surprise, Draco was singing along but in a very soft voice, barely audible.'I love you' She heard him whisper.She looked back up at him and he was still gazing at her.'As endless as forever… Our love will stay together… You're all I need to be here with forevermore.'He was still singing along, gazing right into her eyes.He pulled her closer and swayed to the song. The song fits perfectly to what he felt for her. He specifically requested it tonight, hoping that she would notice the lyrics. That's what he wanted to tell her, but he can't do it right now. He has to wait. He has to look for the Hermione that was lost because of him. He has to bring her back.She was really a dream that came true. He hoped that she would be his again someday. He would do anything for her, no matter what, no matter where or when.She started to relax and rested her head on his chest. She could hear his steady heartbeat. She could feel the softness of his shirt. She remembered she always loved laying her head on his chest. It always reminded her that she changed the heart of this man, that she showed him that he was capable of love She felt tears prickling her eyes. No, I can't cry now.'I just can't compare you with anything in this world…'She really can't. Though she hates to admit it, he was a perfect guy, coward or not. There is no other Draco Malfoy that exists in this world. No one could compare to him, no one could replace him in her stubborn heart.She has to go. She can't take it any longer. She's tired of crying in front of him, tired of crying because of him. She pulled away, which surprised him, and turned away, her back facing him. "I have to go. Thanks for dinner." She apparated and was gone in a second, leaving Draco standing there staring at the cold empty space she once stood.He closed his eyes and sighed. Patience, Draco. Patience. In time she'll open her heart to you. She's not the same Hermione you used to know.He opened his eyes once again and walked to the large window looking at the garden below.He has a plan, a plan to get Hermione back. After their conversation in the park, he was lost. He did say what he felt during their wedding day but he didn't know what he would do next after opening that up to her. He saw how broken she was after he left.He was driving all the way until he stopped, surprised that he was in the Manor of his parents.Flashback (in the Manor after his conversation with Hermione)"I'm a very bad person. I've put Hermione through a lot of things. I don't deserve her." He muttered and drank on his glass of fire whisky.Lucius was silent the whole time while Draco told him what happened. He, too, was drinking a glass of fire whisky. "Son, if you're a bad person, then what more am I?"Draco snorted. "Then it makes the both of us."Lucius poured another round of whisky to their glass. "You're not a bad person, Draco. Things just happen in life. There will always come a time when you make a mistake and a time for you to make things right. Don't blame yourself with what had happened to her. Miss Granger's accident wasn't your fault. It was the lunatic driver's fault."Draco clenched his jaw. "If I didn't leave her, she wouldn't be in an accident."Lucius sighed. "But your marriage wouldn't last. You would just hurt her even more. I knew how you felt. You felt like you were losing yourself. You were used to being the Draco Malfoy and the thought of sharing your life with someone for the rest of your life puts a great pressure on you. Miss Granger is too good for you and you were afraid that you wouldn't be good enough for her. You were afraid you wouldn't make her happy."Draco glanced at his father. "How did you know that's how I felt?"Lucius pursed his lips. "Because the same thing happened to me and your mother."He frowned. "You left mother in the aisle too?"Lucius chuckled. "Of course not. I was the bad guy. Let's just say I left your mother the night we got married for two months. I wandered around and tried to find myself. Being in an arranged marriage does put you to a lot of pressure. I didn't know if I really loved your mother nor am I even capable of love. When I left, that's when I realized that I needed her more than I needed anyone. I finally realized how much she loves me and I felt the same for her, that's why I came back."Draco frowned and drank on his glass. "I didn't know that."The old man smirked. "Why should we tell you? It's in the past. We should never dwell on the past because what matters is now."Draco looked at the glass he was holding. "What could I do for Hermione?"His father shrugged. "I know nothing about Miss Granger, except her brightness and excellence in spells, you should know what to do. You're a Malfoy."Narcissa came inside the parlor they were staying. She was listening to their conversation the whole time. "Draco, dear, a woman just needs time. Like you said, she's been through a lot. She may still be hurt right now and the idea of loving someone might scare her. She can't remember the guy who broke her heart so she may be finding a hard time to trust anyone. You just need to take one step at a time. Let her know the real you, know her as well." She smiled. "Don't force her to fall in love with you. Let her be the one to do that."He frowned. "I'm confused.""Love is really confusing. Just offer her your friendship, gain her trust. She needs to know she could trust you and you should trust yourself that you would never hurt her again." Narcissa sat beside Lucius and held his hand. "Love - takes time."Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooo'As endless as forever…Our love will stay together…You're all I need to be her with forevermore."Draco sighed. His folks were right, and yet, he still can't understand. He asked his friends and even Pansy, still they said the same thing. Their relationship began so fast during that speed dating event. They loved each other from that day, why can't it be the same again?Blaise even called him when Hermione was taking pictures of him. He suggested some weird ways to Draco and that a small problem occurred in his company.Draco told her the pictures were for his girlfriend. He didn't know why he said that. He just wanted to spend time with her and honestly, he wanted to push his luck and see if she would be jealous. But, she didn't care.She was the girlfriend he was talking about. He's the one looking for her. He's looking for that Hermione, but if he can't find the old Hermione, he would embrace the new one and love her as much as he did before…even more if that's possible.I'll do anything to get her back, whether she cares or not. I'll do anything to prove her how much I love her even if it takes me forever.A/N: Okay? This is the longest I've ever written. It's two in the morning. Anyway, please oh please review. It keeps me inspired to write some more. Haha. First song is 'Breathe – Taylor Swift'. Next 'Everybody – Ingrid Michaelson' then the last is a 'Forevermore (new version)' – Side A Band. Review guys! Thanks. Have a rough draft of Chapter ten and eleven. By the way, this isn't the same as the movie. I had to add some things because if I do the same as the movie I would've finished this fic already and it would be too fast. I want Dramaione to develop their relationship in a quite realistic way. :D Sorry if there are grammatical errors, cause I'm too tired and too excited to post this. I don't want to keep you guys waiting. Again, review. :D

A/N: Late upload again guys. I was busy because of exams. Thank you for the reviews and views! Wow. But please, review again. Haha. Please be reminded that this story is from one day to another. Not consecutive days. Imagine different scenes in a movie. Okay. Review again. Thanks. Love ya guys! You rock!Disclaimer: I don't own anything.Chapter 10Hermione had another restless morning. It was Sunday and they don't have any scheduled photo shoots. Ginny was seated in the living room while reading a book, a cup of tea on the side table."Good morning, Ginny." Hermione sighed, rubbing her face with her palm.Ginny peeked through her book and grinned. "Good morning to you, Hermione. You went home last night. Where were you?"Hermione flushed. "I had dinner with someone."Ginny smirked. "And does this certain someone have a name? Like, say…Draco Malfoy?"She flushed some more. "Yes, but it was just a business dinner. You know, for taking his photos."Ginny giggled. "No one treats someone to dinner just for taking a few shots of them."Hermione played with her fingers, switching from foot to foot. "Well, apparently Draco does." Why was she embarrassed? And of all people, to Ginny? She should stop her friend for asking any more questions.Keep her nose out of your business Hermione.Ginny cocked her head to the side. "Did something happen last night?"She gaped at her friend's absurd question. "No! I would never do that. I don't sleep with someone after the first date – which isn't a date – it's just a dinner." She added when Ginny's mouth opened once she said the word date.The weaslette raised her perfectly shaped brow. "I wasn't talking about sleeping with anyone, Miss Defensive." She grinned. "But, as I remember, you did that before. And I believe it was with the same guy you had a 'date' with last night."Hermione was now the same color as her friend's hair. "Ginevra Molly Weasley, stop it right now! Again, it wasn't a date. Nothing happened. We just ate and well danced a little –" she tried to control her thoughts of those sweet minutes in his arms. "- It was in the past anyway. And put your nose out of my business." She sounds exasperated.Ginny playfully rolled her eyes. "Okay, okay. Whatever you say, Miss Granger. Just stop blushing like that and maybe I'll believe you."Hermione scooted to the kitchen and made herself her own tea. She can't stop blushing. Damn Ginny and her mouth. She placed some slice of bread in the toaster when she heard someone knock on their door."I'll get it." Ginny yelled.She was now putting the tea bag on her cup when she heard voices in the living room."Hermione! You have a visitor."She darted towards the living room and was stopped on her tracks when she saw Draco standing in the middle of the room. He was carrying a big red sack on his shoulder. "Happy Christmas, Hermione." He smirked.She frowned. "It's not Christmas yet."Ginny was watching them both looking like someone watching a reality show, waiting for something to happen."I know." Draco smiled sheepishly. "But, since you've forgotten the past, I want to make it up for you. You know – for all the time that was lost."Hermione was still silent, not moving at all. She thought he would finally stop bugging her, again, she was wrong. But then, why can't she send him away?Ginny rolled her eyes and broke the awkward silence. "Are those presents?"Draco nodded, never breaking his eye contact with Hermione. "Presents for Hermione."Ginny clapped her hands in delight and sat on the sofa she vacated. "Well? Hermione? Your presents?"Hermione glanced at her friend who gave her a look to go near Malfoy. She sighed and sat in front of him, which was beside Ginny. Draco kneeled on the floor and opened the sack. He took one gift out first. "For your first Christmas."Ginny counted along as he pulled out more presents from the sack. The room started to fill with different presents in all sizes and each has a unique wrapper. Hermione was still sitting quietly beside Ginny, never breaking her gaze at Draco. She doesn't know what to say. All she ever felt were the butterflies fluttering in her stomach."Twenty - twenty one - twenty two –" Ginny stopped, noticing that the sack was empty. "It still lacks one more. Where is gift number twenty three?"Draco grinned and pointed at himself. "I was hoping I could be gift twenty three."Hermione and Ginny giggled. Ginny nudged Hermione at her arm. "What a sweet guy, right?"Hermione just playfully rolled her eyes and peered at Draco. "Thanks for all the gifts." A blush started to form her cheeks. "I especially liked the last one."He smiled and showing a hint of pink in his pale cheeks.Oh my, an embarrassed Draco Malfoy. She thought."I liked the last one too." He whispered.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooHermione and Ginny were looking at the photos they have taken in the computer when they heard the small bell of their door ring.The both checked who it was."Ladies, your lunch." Draco announced. He was carrying two bags of Chinese food.Ginny clapped her hands in delight. "I could get used to this!"Hermione glared slightly at her friend and glanced at Draco. She smiled at him and helped him unload the food on the table. "Thanks Draco."Draco smirked. "Don't mention it." He suddenly frowned. "Did you grow taller?"Hermione knotted her brows. "No, why?"He placed his hand above her head. "Because before you were just up to my shoulders, then now you're up here in my mind." He pointed to his head.Hermione giggled and blushed. She missed this playful Draco and all the cheesy lines he does.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooThe next day, Hermione was taking photos of a group of teenage girls. She heard the small bell ring again and smiled because she knew who it was."Good morning." Draco greeted them. "Ladies, your coffee." He gave Elena's and Ginny's coffee. "And for my Hermione, coffee and breakfast." He muttered and silently said the word 'my' so she wouldn't hear it. He placed a paper bag on the small table in the studio.The young girls were giggling and batting their lashes at this handsome man in front of them. Hermione mentally shook her head at the behavior of these girls.Draco handed her her coffee. He frowned again. "Did you grow shorter?"Hermione shook her head. "No. Why?"Draco pointed his head. "Because yesterday you're in my mind but now – " he placed his hand on his chest. " – now you're in my heart."Some of the girls were squealing, others were giggling. "Aww, he's so sweet." She heard one girl say."She's such a lucky girl." Another one said."I wish I would meet someone like him someday." Another girl said in a sigh.Hermione bit her lip and took the coffee from his grasp. She doesn't know what to say.Damn! Why am I always speechless around him?"Oh, I almost forgot." He took a tulip from his back. "For you."She smiled and took the tulip, receiving more giggles from the people around them.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooGinny was directing some models in their studio while Hermione was looking at the frames they've taken. She heard the bell ring again.She turned her head and saw Draco smiling at her.He waved his hand "Hi".She waved her hand. "Hi."She bit her lip and turned her head away his direction. She needed to focus on her work.When they were finished, the models were fawning over Draco. Hermione can't help but feel a little jealous. Those are models, Hermione! How could you beat them? They're all hot and beautiful, all Draco's type.She can't compete with them. Just by what they were wearing, all legs, all heels and showing their perfect body in small portions of clothing. She looked at herself. She's just wearing her plain white sleeveless shirt, a peach knitted cardigan and black skinny jeans. She wasn't wearing heels, just her boots. Nothing too revealing or too sexy for Draco and her hair was a mess. It was just in a messy pony tail.She glanced at him and noticed that he wasn't paying any attention to them. He stood and darted to her direction.She stood still, not knowing what he was about to do. He placed his arm around her shoulders and to her surprise he pulled her closer and kissed her ear. "Let's go and have lunch?"Too shocked to speak, she nodded, ignoring all the glared and whispers of the models.Ginny noticed what was going on and glared at all of the models. "Get over it bitches. He's taken. And if you don't want yourselves to look awful in the photos, stop glaring at our photographer."Hermione gave a look at her but she just shrugged back, looking as innocent as ever. Draco had a straight face but she could see a hint of smile on his lips. She was curious what he was thinking about.Once they were out of the studio, Hermione tried to free herself from his arm. "We're away from those girls now. We could stop pretending."He frowned. "I wasn't pretending."Hermione pushed his arm away, freeing herself from his strong arms. She placed her hand on her hips. "You were just using me to stop those beautiful models from bugging you and besides, you're not taken – especially not by me." She looked down, suddenly feeling that cold harsh truth but then she glanced back up at him. "But, it's not like I want to or I want to be in some kind of relationship – friend relationship – stop looking at me like that!" She yelled when Draco was grinning from ear to ear.Merlin! I should learn to stop blabbering like that. You and your big mouth Hermione. Great.Draco held his hand up in defense. "Sorry okay?" Then he suddenly looked hurt. He placed his hands on her shoulders. "But seriously, that hurt, you know. You think so little of me. First, I didn't use you. Second, it's true I don't like them. I'm annoyed and they're not the type of girls that I like. Third, they aren't as beautiful as you… I'm telling the truth." He said when she raised her brow.Fourth, I only want to be with you. He thought, but he can't say it yet. It might scare her. "And lastly, I may not be taken but my heart already is." You already have my heart, Hermione.Hermione waited for him to tell her that she was the one who possesses his heart but he didn't say anything else. He dropped his hands from her shoulders and took her hands. "Where do you want to eat?"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooHermione checked her clock on the bedside table. It was quarter to eleven in the evening. It's been a month since Draco's sweet gestures towards her. She appreciates all the things he's done for her and now, deep inside, she was scared.She was starting to feel the same thing she had before. She was falling in love with Draco and that thought scares her the most. The memory of their wedding started to haunt her. What if he would do the same thing again? She would be more broken than before. She closed her eyes briefly and opened them again.She remembered he said he has this special girl. What if he was just being friendly to her because he pitied her? What if he's just doing this because he felt he owes her? That he is obligated to do this because he thought he caused her this accident? She felt like an air was taken out of her lungs. These might be the reasons why he was being attentive and caring. She felt tears forming her eyes.What if he finally realized that she was okay, that he had made up from his mistakes and then he would move on with that girl? She closed her eyes shut, feeling her tears flow down her cheeks.She should ask Draco one day why was he doing this to her and who is this girl before she does something stupid like totally fall inlove with him.Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooGinny was with Harry at the Burrow and Hermione was in her flat with Luna. Luna needed her opinion on her new article for the Quibbler. She hasn't been to the studio for almost a week and at the same time she haven't seen or heard from Draco. He didn't call or even send him a note. Not like she was waiting or something, mind you. She had to be on a site for a week because of a long photo shoot with a clothing company.It was convenient for her not to see Draco because it gave her time to think. She misses him though.Maybe he went to this special girl. Yeah, maybe he did. Well, good for him. She thought bitterly.She tried to push those negative thoughts away and took one last bite of her pizza.They were seated on the floor with an empty pizza box on the side. Luna was busy writing while Hermione was reading a book. They heard someone knock on the door. Hermione stood up and brushed herself.She turned the knob and opened the door revealing Draco standing outside with a book on his hand. He looked quite relieved to see her.Hermione moved to the side and let him in. Luna looked up and gave him a small smile then continued writing on her article.Draco stopped and turned to face her. "I went to the studio and it was closed. I was looking for you."Hermione frowned. "Why are you looking for me?"He cocked his head to the side. "Why do we look for a certain person?""Because you like that person?" Luna said in her dreamy voice but never taking her eyes away from her paper.Draco shook his head. "No. Because they're lost."Hermione folded her arms. "Why? Am I lost?"Draco shook his head again. "No. But I can't lose you on my mind."Luna glanced up and shook her head slightly and went back to her work.Hermione's lips formed a curved smile. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Hi."He smirked. "Hi.""So why are you here?" she can't help but ask.He showed her the book he was holding. "I want to lend you this book. It's my favorite."She cocked her head to the side. "Okay." She took the book from his grasp and her eyes grew wide. It was her favorite book in the Bodleian Library.Draco was studying her at what her reaction would be. The first time he tried, she walked away. And now – she held the book up to her chest like it was the most important thing in her life. "Okay. I'll read this. Please, seat. Tea?"He smirked and took a seat on the sofa. "No thanks."Hermione sat back down on the floor, Draco sat down beside her. "I'm sorry if I didn't call you. There was a problem in the company that I had to handle. It's all solved now."She glanced at him. "You don't need to explain. I was out for a week." And as if I would believe you. You just spent time with your girl.He nodded. "I know you were out."She shook her head. "Of course you do."He smiled. "Yeah. So how was the shoot?"Hermione looked up the ceiling, trying to recall of the events that happened last week. "It was good. Tiring, but good." She suddenly turned to face him. "Oh! And I saw my friend there."This intrigued him. "Really? Who?"Hermione smiled and played with the book she was holding. "Andrew."Luna looked back up at her. "Oh, the guy who courted you when you took those classes in photography?"Hermione glared at her. "He's a friend, Luna. He's always been that way."She glanced nervously at Draco whose lips were now formed in a straight line. "Well, I hope to meet this Andrew one time. I'm sorry butI have to go." He stood abruptly and headed towards the door. He didn't have time to close the door because he suddenly apparated."Thanks, Luna." Hermione said.Luna frowned. "What did I do?"Hermione rolled her eyes, stood, and shut the door.Was he jealous? Why? He shouldn't be jealous. He has this girl already that he spent a week with.A/N: What do you think? I already have chapter 11 on progress. I really have changed some of it from the movie. I'm kind of enjoying adding different parts in the story. So for people who knew the movie, I'm sorry but I want to change it a little. You know how fast this fic would be if I would really copy the movie. Sorry if there are grammatical errors or typo errors. Didn't re-read. Too sleepy. It's 3am. Have to wake up at 6:30am. Enjoy! BETA! Review!

A/N: I left a review for those who asked about Ginny's behavior, so there. I'm happy though because I get to know what you guys think of my fic and what you want to happen and etc. Haha. Thank you for the great reviews from others too. I'm really smiling every time there's a new review for my fic. It makes me want to write more.Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. *sighs*OooooooooChapter 11Draco slammed the door shut in his room. He unbuttoned the first two buttons of his shirt and took the bottle of fire whisky. He opened it and drank straight from it. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and grimaced at the sudden burning sensation flowing down his throat.Andrew? Who the fuck is Andrew?He ran his hand through his hair and started to pace in his room. He drank more from his bottle.The way he said that bloke's name. The way she smiled as she recalled the events within that week.He took another swig from the bottle and groaned.If only no problem occurred in his company, he would've been there with her during those days and could keep an eye on that Andrew. He cursed under his breath. He drank another and another until the bottle is empty. He threw the now empty bottle across the room and heard it shatter into pieces.This Andrew was there for her when he left her.That thought hurts. He slumped on the floor, resting his back on the edge of the bed. He bent his knees close to his chest and rested his arms on top of it.Andrew was the one who replaced him after he left Hermione.You deserve this Draco. He thought to himself. He leaned his head at the edge of the bed; he suddenly felt his world spinning from the whole bottle he just drank.So what? You'll give up now?Draco covered his face with his hand and moved it up to run through his hair. He gave a loud sigh.No. I won't give up. I'll prove to her that I've changed and I'm the better guy. This Andrew isn't a threat.Draco struggled to get up. He pushed himself from the floor and crawled to his bed. He buried his face in the pillow. This chap would be sorry if he ever makes a move with my Hermione.OoooooooooThe following day, Draco was having tea in Zabini Manor with the gang. He had a terrible hangover which forced him to drink an awful taste of potion to get rid of it. He pushed the thoughts of Andrew-Hermione at the back of his mind. He already had asked his assistant, Philippe, to do some background research about this bloke. He would get the information later in his office."Congratulations Blaise, you're now a father." Draco raised his cup of tea.Blaise snorted. "Thanks. Now, I'm officially restless every night. But not like those nights with Pansy, if you know what I mean." He raised his brow with a sly smile on his face.Draco looked disgusted while Theo shook his head. "That's why I don't want to be a father…for now." They all chuckled for a while until they noticed that Marcus had been quiet for the whole time."What's wrong mate?" Blaise asked."Trouble in paradise?" Theo teased.Marcus sighed and nodded. "Padma's been distant lately. I think she's cheating on me."They all gaped at Marcus, not knowing what to say."Maybe she's just having this crimson tide all women complain about." Blaise said, waving his hand as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.Theo gave Marcus a pat on the back. "Blaise is right. It's nothing to worry about. You know how women are."Marcus groaned. "But deep in my gut I feel that there's something wrong. I don't know. I tried to give time to her but she would just push me away. I gave her a lot of gifts. A car, the latest bag, everything. Last night, she was finally the Padma I knew when I told her I have an important thing to give her. She was very excited and even bought a new dress for our date. I mean, I gave her a set of diamond earrings for cripes sake! But she just ignored it and became the distant Padma again. I mean, am I missing something?"Theo thought for a moment. "Maybe she doesn't like diamond earrings. Try the emerald ones, chicks dig it."Blaise rolled his eyes. "Don't listen to Theo. Give her some time, man. Maybe she doesn't like gifts."Draco was still silent, deep in thought.Marcus ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Then what does she want? We went to dinner, watched a movie, and made love. I don't know what's wrong. I still love her but lately, I don't feel that she loves me."Draco moved his eyes to Marcus. "Try to propose to her."Marcus opened his mouth then shut it back again. He shook his head. "No. I can't. I'm not ready for that step yet."Draco shrugged. "Then you'll just lose her and that feeling sucks big time. You have no idea how much that hurts."Marcus sighed. "I guess you're right.""I know I'm right."Marcus nodded and took a sip from his cup.Theo shook his head. "Love. I can't imagine being in love yet. Just seeing you all in different dilemmas makes me want to remain single…for now."Blaise chuckled. "Someday you'll eat your words Theo. It's nice to have someone by your side who loves you and who would take good care of you. Watch. Pansy would come in –" He held his hand up and glanced at the door."- five…four…three…two…one…"Draco chuckled when nothing happened."Nothing happened." Theo chortled.Blaise ignored them. "…one…two…three…" Then the door opened. "See? I haven't counted up to five yet and here's my lovely wife." Pansy came out and beamed at her husband holding a tray of blueberry muffins. A house elf was trailing behind her carrying a pitcher of pink lemonade."This woman loves me." Blaise said smugly."Hi baby." Pansy sat beside Blaise and kissed him on the lips. "What are you guys talking about?" Pansy asked placing muffins on each of their plates."Marcus thinks Padma's cheating on him." Theo said as a matter-of-fact.Pansy's eyebrows shot up and glanced at Marcus. "How could you say that? Have you seen her with someone else?"Marcus shook his head. "No. I just feel it."She rolled her eyes. "You shouldn't assume things just because you feel it. If she knew about this, she'll feel betrayed. You should trust her, you know. After all those years you've been together, I don't think she'll cheat on you."Marcus bit on his muffin. "Okay, fine. Let's change the subject, shall we? Draco, how are you and Miss Granger?"Draco stopped midway from sipping from his cup when Marcus asked about Hermione. He glared at his friend for putting the spotlight at him. He placed his cup back down and placed on a blank face. "Everything is going well – until recently when she told me that she saw this Andrew guy in the photo shoot she's been to."Blaise frowned. "Who's Andrew? Is he a muggle?"Theo and Marcus leaned closer, waiting for his response. He really didn't want to talk about this right now but he had no choice since he knew his friends wouldn't let him leave without telling everything. Pansy was waiting for his response too.He clenched his jaw. "Andrew, unfortunately, is the guy who courted her before when she went to this photography class. I don't know if he's a wizard or a muggle. Probably a muggle."They all formed an O on their lips except Pansy.Pansy placed her hand on his arm. "Draco, he was just someone who courted her, not an ex-boyfriend. So you don't have to worry."Draco shrugged. "I know. I'm not worried." He lied. Pansy knew he was so she gave him a look."Okay, fine. I'm a little worried. I don't know if she had mutual feelings with him or something. He might mess things up between me and Hermione. I want to take away all those pains I've caused her. I want her to be happy with me. I want her to know that I'm the one for her."Pansy placed her hand on his and gave it a small squeeze. "I know someday everything would be okay. About this Andrew, he wouldn't be a threat. He's just a friend."Draco glanced at her and smirked. "I sure hope so. I really love her."Pansy smiled. "I know you do. Muffin?"oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooIt was almost three months since the day they met in Flourish and Blotts and it has been four days since the 'Andrew Revelation'. He just read the information about Andrew RichardsApparently, Andrew is a wizard and belongs to the wealthiest families in the whole world, just like the Malfoy's. He grew up in Scotland but resided in France. He went to a different school of wizardry. He is currently a doctor for both magical and muggle world.Draco remembered he met Andrew from one of the Galas his family held. They have the same age, but not the same height and not the same hair color. Andrew is a few inches shorter than Draco and his hair is dark brown.Draco placed the folder of Andrew's profile inside his drawer and continued with his work. He was reading the progress report of his company when he heard his phone ring. He pressed the button."Sir, Mr. Potter is here."He rolled his eyes. "Send him in."In just a few seconds, Harry was inside his office. He sat in the chair across Draco making himself comfortable."I know why you're here." Draco said as he leaned on his chair. He rested his elbows on the armrest.Harry pretended to take lint off his coat. "Then I won't be long." He looked at Malfoy straight in the eye."I'm just here to warn you. One more mistake and I swear you would receive the unforgivable. She's been through a lot already, Malfoy. She was fine without you…then here you are…back and ready to crush her heart all over again."Draco frowned. He was tired of Potter's lectures. It's time to tell him everything. "Really? That's what you think? Do you really know what she thinks? Even when we were dating before, she didn't open anything to you. Why? Because she knew you would judge her." He chuckled. "You know what, I don't need to explain to you, Potter, nor do I need your warning. I know this is my last shot and I know things are different now. I love her and I won't give up on her, not now, not ever. I know she's been through a lot because of me and maybe, that's why I'm back. I want to make it up to her. I want to make things right. No matter how hard it is to get her back – I'll do it." He leaned closer and rested his arms on his desk. "You could give me the avada kedavra or hex me all you like if I failed her once again, because none of those things would hurt me. The only thing that could hurt me, crush me, kill me is Hermione's rejection." He tried to catch his breath, waiting for any reaction from the boy who lived. He got nothing.Harry stood up. "Okay. Now that's been settled. I better be going. It's good that we've finally agreed on something." He walked to the door and held on to the knob. He glanced back at Draco. "Last shot."He turned the knob and opened the door leaving Draco alone once again in his office.Draco groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. He finally let it all out to Potter. It was the truth, only Hermione could hurt him. He wasn't worried about Potter's threat. He was much more worried that the new Hermione wouldn't love him, much less like him.He heard his cellphone ring. He looked at the screen and saw it was her. He smiled and pressed the button. They were getting along just fine but he could sense that she was a bit distant to him."Hey.""Hi Draco. Could we talk? Let's meet at lunch time. Same place?""O-okay. See you there." Draco stuttered and pressed the 'end' button. Is this the rejection he was worried about? What could she possibly want to talk about? Has he done something wrong?He began to think of all the wrong things he may have done recently. He can't think of anything.Maybe it was the lasagna I tried to cook for her. He grimaced at that thought. That lasagna did taste like shit.Or the time I let her ride the horse and she fell off. He couldn't help but stifle a laugh. He remembered the smug face of Hermione when she learned that they were going horseback riding. He offered her his help when she was trying to ride the horse but she shrugged him off and said she could do it. So she tried to ride but slipped and fell on the other side instead.He sighed and leaned back on his chair. Whatever it is, I'll have to meet her later.A/N: Too late upload. Very busy. Please RR. Thank you.

A/N: I know I haven't been updating recently and it takes me forever to upload the next chapters. So sorry. I had this "writers block". Haha. This story is really different from the movie. I've added a lot of things. I hope I could stick with the plot. Anyway, enjoy! And oh yeah, review.OooOooOChapter twelveHermione was absently playing with her fingers as she waited nervously for the clock to turn 12. She tried to shift her mind by reading the magazine. She flipped through some pages and peeked through the magazine to check the clock on top of her desk. 11:30 am.She rolled her eyes and tried to actually read the magazine but her mind drifted to the thoughts that kept her awake last night.She was really getting along with Draco, but still, she needs to know if this is all real. She also needs to know who was this special girl he mentioned before and also, if they would develop a new relationship, she has to tell him the truth. She cannot live a life that's full of lies. The problem is how would she tell him the truth?She looked the clock. 11:35Seriously?Hermione didn't want to be too early for her lunch with Draco. She wanted him to be the one to wait for her. If she would be the one waiting for him, she would just forget what her purpose was.She placed the magazine down and checked her phone once it rang. There was a message from Harry.*Went to see Malfoy. I just had a little chat with him.*Panic rose through Hermione. Did Harry tell Draco the truth?Then her phone rang again. Still from Harry.*Don't worry. I didn't tell him your secret. Now quit that look on your face.*She shut her mouth and sighed in relief. Her phone rang again.*Oh, and Hermione? I need to talk to you. I'll see you later after lunch.*She frowned. What could Harry want to talk about? She shrugged it off. It might be another long lecture from the good Harry James Potter. He would judge her again and her actions.Ginny knocked on her door. "It's almost lunch time, where are we going to eat? Or would we ask for delivery?"Hermione bit her lip and tucked her hair behind her ears. "Uh- I'm actually having lunch with Draco. I need to meet him 'cause I have to ask him something."Ginny's brow shot up. "Really? What are you going to ask him?"Hermione sighed and leaned back on her chair. "I want to ask who his special girl is."Ginny leaned against the door and placed a hand on her hip. "I think the answer to that question is too obvious." She grinned at Hermione and turned to leave. "Okay. I think you just want a confirmation from Malfoy. I don't care if you leave me alone for lunch." She said jokingly. "Elena would treat me today anyway, isn't that right Elena?"Elena's head jerked up. "What?"Ginny gave her a look. "I want Chinese food for lunch."Elena just nodded.Hermione smiled. Ginny is such a great friend. She understood her so much. She's like a sister Hermione never had. She remembered the night when Draco left her.OooOooOShort flashback"I swear Hermione, I'll kill him if I see him." Ginny was beet red. Her face matches her hair. "He fooled us all, pretending that he cares for you."OooOooOHermione frowned. Ginny was furious when Draco left her. Why was she acting that way now? Does her best friend know something she doesn't know?Ginny, Ron and Harry were always there for her. They would always have her back and sometimes help her decide through life. Though she is known as the 'Brightest Witch of their Age' there are some things that she really doesn't know… and that is about love, life and pain.She checked her clock and saw it was ten minutes past 12. Just the time she was expecting.She stood up and grabbed her purse. I guess I have to talk to Gin too.OooOooOJust as she expected, he was waiting for her at a small bistro they usually eat lunch at. He stood up and was about to give her a small hug when she motioned him to remain seated.Draco froze. This might be the rejection he feared. He took a seat and clasped his hands together."I ordered for you, if that's okay? We could just order again if you won't like it." Draco looked expectantly at Hermione. She nodded but was looking anywhere but him.What could be on her mind?Hermione let out a short breath and finally turned to face him. "I want to know-"She paused, shutting her eyes briefly and opening them once again. It's now or never. Draco was holding his breath too."I want to know who your girlfriend is."Draco looked at her in shock. That was not what he expected. And where the fuck did that come from? "What? I don't know what you're talking about."Hermione cocked her head to the side. "Remember the time when you let me take a photo of you? You said you'll give it to your girlfriend. I just want to know who she is and does she know where you are and who you've been spending your time with?"Draco thought for a moment, his face softened and a smile formed on his lips. Oh, so that's what this is all about. He began to chuckle.She raised her brow. That wasn't what she was expecting. "Am I amusing you Draco? Because this is a serious matter. "He paused and cleared his throat. He tried to place on a straight face. "I'm sorry. This is truly a serious matter. A matter of life and death as you put it." He began to chuckle again, and to think he was a nervous wreck all morning.She glared at him. "I'm serious. This isn't funny. I don't want to be suddenly attacked by a jealous girlfriend.Draco covered his mouth with his palm to stop himself from laughing. He likes it when she's angry. She has this small red hint on her cheeks and this cute little pout that she does with her lips. He paused. He missed those lips. He can't wait to feel her soft sweet lips again.Now he finally composed himself. He sighed and placed his hand gently on hers. "I don't have a girlfriend. I told you, she's a special girl in my life. I'm trying to help her find her way back.""Back where?"He gave a sad smile. "I told you this already. Back to me of course."She pulled her hand away. "What's her name?"He sighed. "I can't tell you.""Why not?" She's annoyed with this already."Because it would ruin everything." She could hear desperation in his voice."Why? I can't go on like this knowing that you have this girl in your life. I need to know who. And I don't know if I'm a distraction or if I'm causing any problems. Just tell me who she is." She said almost in a demanding tone.He ran his hand through his hair. He can't think of anything to change the topic about this girl, who by the way is right in front of him. Luckily, the waiter arrived with their meal. "Let's eat first. I'll tell you after, okay?" It would buy him enough time to think of something while they were eating.She huffed but finally gave in. She was hungry after all.After a quiet meal, she wiped her lips with a table napkin and drank her orange juice. "I'm done, now talk."Draco took a sip from his goblet of wine and gently placed it back on the table. "Alright, I'll tell you who this girl is if and only if you'll tell me who this Andrew chap is."Her mouth dropped. That prick! I shouldn't have agreed to eat first. Sneaky bastard.He smirked. Oh this would be fun.She closed her mouth shut and leaned back on her chair as she folded her arms. "Fine. But you first."He copied her and folded his arms as well. "It would be unfair for me since the only answer you need from me is a name. I, on the other hand, have a lot of questions regarding this Andrew." He sneered at the mention of Andrew's name.She narrowed her eyes. "I have a better idea. We would take turns asking each other some questions. I would also like to know about this girl of yours."Draco can't help but stifle a laugh. It's ironic how Hermione wanted to ask questions about herself.Hermione raised her brow. "What?"He shook his head. "Nothing. But yeah, I agree to your terms. One last thing." He leaned closer. "Name would be the last question."She held her hand out. "Deal."He shook her hand gently and gave it a little squeeze before releasing it. "Good. Me first. Did you love him?"She cocked her head to the side. "Hey, could we please go to basic information first? Like, where we met and the likes?"He rolled his eyes. "Okay, Miss Know-it-all. Where did you meet?" He asked mockingly. I already know this shit.She gave a short smile "That's better. Well, we met at a photography class here in Muggle London. Where did you and this girl meet?"He thought for a moment, carefully choosing the right words to say so he wouldn't slip anything. "Same, at school. Next, Luna said this guy courted you. Did you have any mutual feelings for him? Have a fling? A romantic relationship"She held her hands up. Is she being investigated? "Wait, one question at a time and basic ques-""There isn't any rule that we would only ask one question for each turn and just answer the damn question. We're past those basic questions already." Merlin was he annoyed. He already knew how they met, where they studied. His investigator already answered those.She glared at him, but he does have a point, there wasn't any rules regarding the number of questions and the content of the questions. She also couldn't argue with him, she wouldn't know about this girl if he would be angry. "Yes, we did have a relationship, as friends. He's sweet, kind, gentleman, funny, smart – stop glaring." She said because he's been glaring every comment she says. "No mutual feelings, just friends. You can relax now.""Why not?" Draco asked."Why not what?""Why didn't you have a relationship with him when he seems great for you?"She smiled sadly. "He is great but, I was broken.""Broken?""Amnesia" she faked a laugh.He stiffened. He suddenly remembered the information given to him. She went to photography class a few months after he left her. Cold shivers run through his spine. If Hermione didn't have amnesia she might've been with Andrew. She was too lost to let someone in her life that time. He blamed himself once again. He was really selfish.Hermione pursed her lips. "I think it's fair if I'd be the one asking questions right now."Draco was too distracted to hear what she said so he motioned her to go on."Where is she?"He looked up at her. Right in front of me. "Uhh, she's around."She thought for a second. "So she's in muggle London?"He shrugged, not knowing what to say. This question game wasn't as easy as he thought. Oh how the tables have turned. "She's travels a lot." That was quite true since she do shoots outside the studio.Hermione nodded. This girl might be as rich as Draco and do business trips around the world. How could she compete with that? "What is she like? Like, her looks and personality."He looked down on his clasped hands. Now how could he describe Hermione without her noticing that it was her he's talking about? Think Draco, think! "She's…" He glanced back at her. He smiled slowly. "She's an angel in disguise. When I see her, I would like to stop time just to look at her for the rest of my life. She is truly beautiful inside and out. She has a pure heart and always thinks about the well being of others. She isn't selfish nor does she lie. She is the light in my dark life. She gave the warmth in my cold stone heart. She is the reason why I wake up each day and the reason why I have good dreams at night. I can't imagine my life without her."She looked away. It's painful to hear how great this girl is to him. She couldn't possibly be that girl. If she was that girl, he wouldn't have left. Like he said, he can't imagine life without this girl.He frowned. What is she thinking now?She sighed. This is what she asked right? He just answered truthfully. She faced him again. "You said you'll help her find her way back to you. How would you do that?"Draco leaned closer, resting his arms on the table. "You know, make things right. Show her the love she deserves."She gave a sad smile. He really loves this girl, and it wasn't her. All Draco shows her are friendly gestures. He just pitied her for having amnesia.She's heard enough. She can't take anymore answers from Draco on how he loves this girl. "What's her name?"Draco's pulse quickened. He took another sip. He can't tell her yet. If he does, all of this would be wasted. He is trying to take things slowly until she fully trusts him again. If she knew he was the bastard who left her, she would hate the gut out of him. He would never have her back.He briefly shut his eyes and opened them again. He glanced at her; she was waiting for his response. He started to stutter. "Her name is…""Hermione?" They heard a male voice call from the door.She turned her head around to see who it was. Draco jerked his head to see who it was too. A tall man was waving at her with a big smile showing his perfect white teeth.Not as perfect as mine. Draco thought bitterly.The man has dark brown hair and blue eyes and a bit tan than Draco. He has the same built as Draco. His body could be seen through his casual shirt and pants. Draco instantly knew who he was. He clenched his fist and placed on his usual Malfoy façade.Hermione stood up as the man gave her a big warm hug. "I knew it was you Hermione.""Andrew, it's nice to see you here."Andrew placed his hand on her arms and studied her for a moment. "How are you? You look lovely."She gave him a warm smile. "I'm good. Thanks." She heard someone clear their throat and mentally smacked her head when she remembered who it was. She really might have amnesia. She pulled herself away from Andrew's grip. "Oh, Andrew this is Draco. Draco, Andrew."Andrew held out his hand "Draco Malfoy. It's nice to see you after all these years. How is Cissy?"Cissy? Narcissa? They know each other? Hermione thought.Draco stood as well. He has a stone cold stare as he shook his hand. "My mother's fine. How is Victoria?"Andrew smirked. "Mother is doing great. She's quite busy these days arranging a gala next week…which reminds me, here." He handed Draco an elegant invitation. "I was about to send it to Cissy after I grab some coffee. Luckily, you're here." He took out another invitation. "This is your invitation, Draco."Draco gave a short nod and placed it on the inside pocket of his coat."I could bring my date, right?" Draco asked.Andrew nodded. "Of course you can. Who is your date? Is it Miss Greengrass?"Hermione looked at Draco. Astoria is the mystery girl?Draco smirked and placed his arm around hers. "Hermione is my date."Andrew looked at Hermione to Draco. "Oh. I didn't know you were together."Hermione shook her head. "Uhm- no. We're just friends."Draco frowned while Andrew looked confused.Hermione pulled away from Draco. "I'm sorry, but how do you know each other?"Andrew smiled at her. "Family friend."Draco looked at her as well, still annoyed that she said they were just friends. "Galas, parties, auctions, fund raisers, business partners…take your pick."Hermione looked at them, shocked that they knew each other. How small could the world be? She knew Andrew was a wizard and a wealthy man like Draco. She knew he resided in France for some time."Okay. Wow. What are the odds? So that's why we're past the basic questions, right Draco?" She raised her brow at Draco, who in return looked at her innocently."What basic questions?" Andrew glanced at Hermione then Draco."Nothing." They both said in unison without looking at Andrew.Andrew could feel the tension between the two so he cleared his throat. "I would love to stay and chat, but I really have to go. See you soon, 'Mione."Hermione turned to face him and smiled. "Of course. It's nice to see you too." Andrew pulled Hermione again into a tight hug. He pulled away and faced Draco. "Draco. See you next week, yeah?"Draco nodded. "I will send the invitation to my mother as soon as I get back to my office."Andrew smirked. "Alright." His eyes darted to Hermione. "Bye.""Bye." Hermione mumbled.And Andrew was gone.Hermione was still surprised that Draco and Andrew knew each other and she was also angry at Draco for not telling her he knew Andrew.They both went back to their seats. "When are you gonna tell me you knew Andrew?"Draco held his hands up. "I didn't know he was the Andrew you knew. He isn't the only Andrew in this world."She eyed him suspiciously. "Did you hire someone to get information about him?"He scoffed and pretended to look hurt. "What? You think I would hire the best private investigator to know all about Andrew just because you told me about him? Why would I do that? That's insane."She leaned back on her chair and folded her arms. She would wait for him to tell her the truth.Draco shook his head in disbelief and sipped from his goblet. He looked away and stole some glances at her checking if she would just let it go. She wasn't giving up. He placed the goblet down and sighed. "Okay. I- I may have asked a friend about Andrew. But I just did it to –" He thought for a moment. How should he put this? "I did this to know who your new friends are."She shook her head. "Whatever." She knew well he was lying. He did that to her before when they were dating. He would have her co-workers investigated. It was annoying her to death but she can't stop him from doing that. But, she won't be mad at him because he lied. After all, she's lying to him as well. Which reminds her, how could she tell him the truth about her fake amnesia?"Galleon for your thoughts?"Hermione glanced at him. "It's nothing.""I'm sorry, 'Mione. Next time I would just ask you."She smirked "Okay."OooOooOHermione went back to her studio after her lunch with Draco. Ginny was busy studying the photos on the long table."How was lunch?" Ginny asked without looking up."It was okay." Hermione collapsed on the couch across Gin."So did he tell you who is this special girl in which, we all know, it's you?"Hermione shook her head. "It's not me. And no, he wasn't able to tell her name because we were interrupted by Andrew."That got Ginny's attention, her head jerked up to see Hermione covering her face with her arm. "Really?""Yeah. He just passed by and said hello."Ginny chuckled. I wish I was there to see the look on Malfoy's face. I bet he was really jealous."Hermione placed her arm down. "They knew each other."Ginny was surprised. "Oh yeah? How?"Hermione shrugged. "Family friends. You know how rich people are."Ginny's mouth formed a small 'O'.Suddenly they heard someone enter their studio. "Hermione?" Someone called out.Both ladies craned their head to see who it was."Harry?" Hermione muttered.Harry walked inside her office and gave a quick kiss on Ginny's lips."What are you doing here love?" Ginny asked Harry and led him to a love seat beside Hermione.Harry scratched the back of his head and looked at Gin to Hermione. "I- I want to ask something to Hermione."Hermione sat back up. "What is it Harry?"Harry stood and started to pace in front of both ladies. "I'm your best friend right?""Of course you are Harry." She's confused."So you would tell me anything, am I correct?""Yes, Harry. What are you trying to say?"Ginny took his arm to stop him from pacing. "What's wrong love?"Harry sighed and looked at Hermione straight in the eye. "Do you feel like I judge you? Do you feel like I criticize all the things you do or the decisions you make? Please, tell me the truth Hermione. I want to know."Hermione bit her lip. How can she say it without hurting her best friend?Ginny looked at Hermione then at Harry.Hermione cleared her throat. "Sometimes, I do feel that way. Maybe, that's why I don't tell you everything."Harry shook his head. "So Malfoy was right. I can't believe you didn't tell me how you feel. You chose to tell Malfoy instead."Hermione's eyes filled up with tears. "I only did that because you do judge me. Like now, you're doing it again. You judge everything I do. Not everyone could be like you Harry."Harry clenched his fist. "I know I could be judgmental. I do tend to tell you that what you're doing is wrong. But it's because I care about you. What kind of friend would I be if I wouldn't tell you that what you're doing is wrong?" He paced once more. "I told you before not to date Malfoy. He would only hurt you. You didn't listen. Then what happened? He left. Now that he's back, what did you do? You pretended to have amnesia. You would lie just to be fooled once again by that slimy bastard? Are you that stupid?""Harry!" Ginny scolded. "Stop it. You don't understand. You don't know everything."Harry glanced at Ginny and glared at her. "You too Gin. You keep tolerating this mess she made. Why? I thought you hated Malfoy. What changed? You know she'll get hurt in the end. You want that to happen to her?"Hermione was crying now. She felt someone place a hand on her shoulder. She looked up and saw Ginny standing beside her."I hate Draco. I still hate him now. But does it mean that Hermione should hate him too just because we hate him? I know this is what Hermione wants. You don't know what she's been through after Draco left her in the aisle. I've spent every night hearing her cry as she sleeps. I've seen her pretend to be okay when I know she's broken inside. I've tried to set her to blind dates, group dates, name it. I blame myself because if it wasn't for me, she wouldn't meet Draco in the speed dating event. I blamed myself for bringing her to this. But there was something different about her when she was with him. It's like they were made for each other." She sat beside Hermione and wiped the tears in her friend's eyes with her handkerchief. She glanced back at Harry."I know she still loves Draco. She just won't admit it. She's too stubborn. You of all people should know that. Harry, I would hear her call out Draco's name every night in her sleep, hell, even when she's just taking a nap in the studio. He is our friend's happiness. Why should we take her happiness away?""Because we all know she would just get hurt." Harry spat."There's always hurt trailing behind love. She truly loves him that's why she gets hurt. If this time, she gets hurt again. Then she would finally let go. She would learn and finally forget about Malfoy. Right now, her decision matters, not Malfoy's. If she decides to end it, then fine. She needs this for closure. It's her life, Harry. We can't dictate what she should do with her life. We're just here to support her.""It's wrong. We all know it. He'll just leave her again in the end." Harry ran his hand through his hair in frustration."We know it's wrong. No one is perfect Harry. People make the wrong decisions but that's how they learn. And it's her who could tell, not fate, not destiny, how this ends or begins." Ginny said.Harry was breathing heavily. He shook his head. "If that's what you want, fine. I'm still not happy about this." He stormed out of the studio leaving the girls alone.Hermione let out some soft sobs. Ginny sat beside her and pulled her into a warm hug. "I'm sorry about Harry. He'll come around eventually.""I've really said Draco's name when I was asleep?"Ginny chuckled. "Out of all the things I've said, that's what you picked up?" She sighed. "Yeah, you always call out for him."Ginny blew her nose with Ginny's handkerchief. "What do I say?"Ginny thought for a moment. "His name. Just his name and you would smile… the smile that I haven't seen since your wedding. Well, not until recently when you saw him again in Flourish and Blotts."She pulled away from Ginny and wiped composed herself. "You should've told me about that."Ginny shrugged. "I just knew you wouldn't believe me and just deny it."Hermione gave a small laugh. "You know me too well. It's kinda freaky."Ginny chuckled and gave a small pat on her back. "I'm sorry about Harry. He's just upset. Give him time and he'll be okay."Hermione gave a sad smile. "I sure hope so. I hate it when he's mad."The girls were quiet and now talking in soft whispers. Little did they know that Harry was just outside the office. He heard everything they said after he stormed out. He knew he did wrong. Blasting out on Hermione that way only proved that Malfoy was right. He should've tried to understand her more, talked to her in a calm way. She's been through a lot and treating her that way should be the last thing he would do. Ginny was right. It's Hermione's life. He can't always dictate what she should do. He admits he did have wrong choices before but he didn't hear anything from Hermione. All she ever did was stand beside him and help him especially during the war. He screwed things up. He apparated back in his flat. He needed to clear his head and think of something to make it up to her.A:N/ Sorry for the late update. Please review. I had to make a lot of adjustments with this fic.

A/N: I've just started writing this chapter after posting chapter 12. I don't want to keep you guys waiting anymore. Thank you for the amazing views and reviews. Thank you for those who followed my fic and also marked it as your favorite. Thank you for those who gave their review. Shout to PandaFatty for always giving her review, which makes me smile by the way. To MySweetSolace, thank you too. I hope I'm making the jealous Draco right. I hope I would receive more comments so I would know what you guys think. Thank you. Oh I read my fic from the beginning and saw all the errors I made. Sorry about that. I honestly need a beta reader.OooOooOChapter 13It was a lovely morning and Draco felt great. He had just added new plans to get Hermione back and it was the perfect day to do one of them, maybe two or three… come what may.He stood and got ready. He was about to leave when Maggie the elf announced that he had a visitor waiting in the living room. He groaned. Who could it be? He cannot cancel all his plans today nor could he be late.He darted towards his living room and was surprised to see who it was.Guess there would be some slight changes with his plans.OooOooODraco knocked on Hermione's door and waited. He was few minutes behind from the schedule he had set for the day. The door opened and he was greeted by Ginny. Does the weaslette live here?"Malfoy. Come in. Hermione would be out in a while."Draco smirked and entered their flat.Ginny motioned him to sit down. "Wait there, I'll call her."Draco sat patiently on the small couch. He scanned around the small living room. The walls were painted gray with white borders. There were small frames with pictures of Hermione and her dearest friends hanging on the wall. On top of the fireplace were more pictures of Hermione and Ginny in Paris. Other pictures were of her parents and also the Weasley's.Their flat was really neat and organized. They have two medium sized windows giving light to the room with white curtains. He looked to the side and saw a single white tulip on a delicate vase. It was beside a small modern style lamp which was on top of a mahogany table. There were boxes with file numbers placed neatly on the floor. Those might be the pictures of their clients. He thought.He heard footsteps coming down from the stairs. When he turned his head, his jaw dropped. Hermione was wearing white shorts, showing her long and fine legs, and a dark blue tank top. Her hair was in a high messy bun."Hi Draco. What brings you here?"Draco stood and smirked, never taking his eyes off Hermione. "I want to invite you to play quidditch with me and my friends."Hermione snorted. That was new. No one ever invited her to play quidditch. She was scared of heights. Doesn't Draco know that? Then she remembered the word Amnesia. "Uhh, I don't play. I'm sorry."Draco tisked. "Is that so? So could you explain to me how you've actually scored 150 points in catching… my heart?"Ginny laughed out loud. "Oh Merlin. Why?"Hermione chuckled. "Really, Malfoy. Stop with all those pick up lines." He should stop joking around and tell those lines to his girl instead.Ginny smirked. "Yes, please do us a favor and stop with all those lines."Draco pretended to look hurt. "Okay. I'll stop it. But one last thing…Hermione, I would be the chaser of your heart even if there are beaters around who keeps me away from you as long as you get to be the keeper of my heart."Ginny rolled her eyes. "Okay, I'll pack my things now."Hermione laughed and playfully hit him in the arm. "Stop it, Draco. It's kinda lame now. Seriously."He grinned. "I know. But for the record, I made the last one up."She nodded. "Oh I know you did."Ginny came back with a broom on her right hand and a big sports bag on her left. "I'm going to play quidditch with you Malfoy. Hermione here, is scared of heights."Hermione thanked Ginny for saving her back. "Yeah. I could just watch and take photos of your game."Draco frowned but then glanced at Hermione. "That's okay. Besides, I need an inspiration for the game."Ginny held her hands up. "If you guys are over with those cheesy lines, just call me. I'll be staying in the kitchen."When they were both left alone in the room, Hermione sat down on the loveseat. Draco sat beside her. "I'm sorry about Gin."He shrugged. "It's okay. I understand that Potter doesn't say those things to her."She scrunched her face. "I can't imagine Harry saying those things either.""Are you ready for this day?" Draco sounds excited.Hermione grinned. "Why? What are you planning today?"Draco smiled. "You'll see."They heard a knock on the door. Hermione stood "Excuse me." Draco nodded and secretly checked something on his pocket. He can't wait to give it to her later.Hermione opened the door. "Andrew?"Draco froze. He placed his surprise gift for Hermione back on his pocket. He turned and saw Andrew hugging Hermione again. What is it with Andrew and hugs?To his satisfaction she pulled away. "What are you doing here?"Andrew shrugged. "I want to ask you personally about this event that I have in 3 weeks. I was hoping if you could be our official photographer? I could tell you the details over at lunch."Hermione bit her lip. "I'm sorry I can't go today. You see, I have a visitor right now."Andrew glanced to the side. He saw a furious Draco standing a few steps away from them. "Oh. Draco. I didn't notice you there.""I figured." He replied coldly.Ginny went out of the kitchen and noticed that there were already three people in the room. She saw who the new visitor was and she beamed at Andrew. "Andrew." She darted towards Andrew and gave him a quick hug. "What are you doing here?"Andrew looked at Draco then to Hermione. "Uh… I was hoping to have lunch with Hermione to talk about this event in three weeks but I guess we could just reschedule."He was about to leave when Ginny thought of a brilliant idea. "Why don't you come with us? Hermione would just watch anyway. You can talk about it after the game."Draco scoffed in disbelief and glared at the weaslette, Hermione gave him an apologetic smile."What game?" Andrew asked."Quidditch. I know you play quidditch." Ginny grinned."Sure. That is, if it's okay with Hermione and Draco." He looked again at the two.Hermione don't know what to say. She can't just turn Draco down. He seemed very excited and determined about his plans for the day. And she knew that bringing Andrew around would just piss him off.She can't just let Andrew leave either, he went all the way to her place and though it was just to talk about business, she did miss his companionship. He was always there for her even through her darkest times and helped her to start all over again. It's time to return the favor."S-sure." Hermione mumbled.Draco immediately glanced at her. He can't believe she agreed to bring Andrew along. He sighed and waved a hand. "Yeah. Sure."Ginny clapped her hands and took her things in the kitchen."Where are we going to play?" Andrew asked Draco."My mansion in Greece. The one were my mother held the St. Mungos fund raising event." Draco replied in a very cold tone that Hermione shivered."Great. I'll tell Gerard to send my things over there."Draco just nodded.Hermione bit her lip, nervously watching the tension between the two."Let's go guys." Ginny announced.This is going to be a long day. Hermione thought.OooOooOThey apparated their way to the airport. There were men in crisp black suits and dark glasses. In the middle was a huge private plane.Andrew whistled. "This is the new plane Draco?""Yes it is. So far, it is the fastest plane in the world." Draco looked smug.Andrew was impressed. "Wait till you see the plane I personally designed.""You designed your own plane?" Hermione gasped.Andrew nodded.Hermione mouthed the word 'wow'. Ginny, on the other hand, was enjoying the scene.Draco waved a hand. "Of course he asked some engineers. You can't just design a plane and have it built."Andrew shrugged. "Well, maybe I did ask some professionals."Draco leaned closer to Hermione's ear. "I told ya."Hermione just shook her head slightly. She's currently in the middle of two kids boasting about their toys."Let's go, shall we?" Draco held his hand out and offered it to Hermione. She smiled and took it.Andrew and Ginny trailed behind.They were greeted by a blonde stewardess. Hermione sat across Draco's while Ginny and Andrew sat on the other side. The plane started to move and fly in the air."It's been a long time since we've played quidditch together." Andrew said trying to start a conversation.Draco snorted. "Yes it has.""Who wins?" Ginny teased.Andrew glanced at Ginny, then at Draco then lastly at Hermione. "He does. He always does."OooOooOThey landed at exactly eleven in the morning. They drove their way to Draco's mansion. It was a silent road trip though. Andrew and Draco were in the front seat while Ginny and Hermione sat on the back. Draco drove the car.Hermione loved the scenery outside. It's been a while since she had been out of the country. With her work as a photographer, she does go to places but never really enjoyed it. She would either take pictures of models, families and the likes but never really just to enjoy herself. Take pictures that she wants.She suddenly felt butterflies in her stomach. She has no idea what would happen today.They safely reached the mansion. Draco took out his wand and magically brought their things inside. The great double mahogany doors opened and they were greeted by an old lady. She may look like she's in her forty's. "Sir Draco, I see Sir Andrew is here as well.""Hi Sara." Draco smirked."Hi." Andrew smiled.She craned her neck and saw the lovely ladies behind them. "Is this Miss Hermione?"Draco gasped. He had forgotten to tell Sara that Hermione had amnesia. "Yes, Sara. I've just told you all the names of my guests. And – Hey! You guessed correctly.""Hi. It's nice to meet you." Hermione smiled. She extended her hand. She wanted to hug Sara but she refrained from doing so. Draco brought her here before when they were together. Sara was like a mother to her. She's very kind and loving and attended to her every need.Sara looked confused but shook her extended arm.Ginny knew how confused the old lady was so she held out her hand. "I'm Ginny."Sara shook Ginny's hand but never taking her eyes off Hermione. She opened the door wider to let them in."Make yourselves at home." Draco announced.He then took Sara's arm and talked to her in a soft voice. Sara gasped and glanced quickly at Hermione. She nodded and went to the kitchen.Hermione looked around. The place was still the same just the way she remembered it. There was the sofa in front of the fireplace in which they would cuddle all night. She blushed at that memory."Let's go to the garden shall we?" Draco waved his hand to show the way. Andrew and Gin went their way first while Draco and Hermione followed. "I have a surprise for you waiting in the garden." Draco whispered.Hermione smiled. "Okay."Draco glanced at her; he could see her excitement showing. They reached the huge glass French doors and when Ginny opened it, they saw all their friends. Ron, Lavander, Luna, Neville, Dean, Padma, Parvati, Katie, Fred, George, Theo, Blaise, Pansy, Marcus, Crabbe, Goyle, and Tracy."Surprise!" They all cheered.Ginny ran to their friends while Andrew greeted the others.Hermione faced at Draco and she gave him a brief hug. "Thank you." She whispered."There's another surprise." He said as he slightly pushed away from her.A man came from the corner. Ginny gasped. Hermione craned her neck and her eyes grew wide."Harry?" She whispered.Ginny darted towards Harry and pulled him into an embrace. She gave him a quick kiss and smiled.Harry smiled back and faced Hermione. "Hi Hermione."Draco stepped aside. Harry gave him a short nod. "Thanks Malfoy."Draco nodded. Potter came to him this morning to ask him for help. At first, he thought it was all a dream. Why the hell would Harry Potter ask help from him? He told about their fight with Hermione and how sorry he was. He needed to do something to make it up for her and the only way to see her is through Draco. He even told Draco that he would accept their relationship for now, but he had to prove not only to Hermione but to everyone that he won't hurt her again…the usual Potter lecture.Well, it's all for Hermione and Draco knew Hermione misses her best friend. He would do anything to make her happy even if it is to help the boy who lived.Hermione's eyes filled up with tears. Harry sighed. "I'm sorry –" He wasn't able to finish his sentence because Hermione hugged him."It's okay Harry. I understand. I'm sorry too."Harry held her tighter. "I'm always here for you. Always remember that."Hermione nodded and pulled away. Draco gave her his handkerchief. She wiped her tears and blew her nose. She gave it back to Draco. Draco only chuckled and placed it back on his pocket."Now that everyone is okay…shall we start the game first or eat lunch?" Draco asked."Eat!" Crabbe and Goyle yelled.Draco rolled his eyes. "Very well then." He snapped his fingers and all the food magically appeared on a long table.Harry gave one last smile at Hermione and went back to Ginny. Hermione faced Draco and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. "Thank you."Draco touched the side of his cheek. "I might as well give you lots of surprises if that's how you thank me."Hermione playfully hit him in the arm until Andrew came. "Let's go eat?"Draco clenched his fist. How dare could he interrupt them. He'll teach that Andrew a lesson later during the game.Hermione nodded. "Sure. Draco, join us?"Draco followed them. They sat across Ginny and Harry. Hermione was in the middle between Andrew and Draco. Draco then started to put food on Hermione's plate."Oh, Hermione doesn't eat that." Andrew said."I'm sure she does." Draco smirked. He remembered it was Hermione's favorite before."No. She doesn't eat the meatballs in the spaghetti. Just the sauce." Andrew insisted."She loves meatballs." Draco said through clenched teeth.Harry was watching them both while Ginny was stifling a laugh.Hermione placed her hand on the side to stop them both. "Enough. I could put my own food."Andrew shrugged and placed food on his plate. Draco was whispering incoherent words while putting his own choice of food on his plate.OooOooOAfter the meal, everyone gathered to the huge field to start the quidditch game. The rest who aren't playing sat on the high seat on the side.All the players got ready for the game. Draco went to where Hermione sat. He brought her a basket. "Here are some snacks and drinks. You could share them if you want. Don't go to the edge because you might fall. If you need to go to the loo there is a restroom below."Hermione placed a hand on his shoulder. "I'll be fine. All our friends are here. You should take good care of yourself."Draco smirked. "Okay. Just call me if you need anything. I'll end the game if I have to. If you feel tired you could go ahead in your room. Sara would accompany you."Hermione smiled. "Okay, okay. How about you? Do you have any requests?"Draco looked to where Andrew was, who's currently waving at Hermione and she waved back, and then back at Hermione. "Please don't fall in love with someone else."He stood and sat on his broom and flew away.A/N: I hope no errors this time. And if there still is, I'm sorry. I'll try to update soon. Please review. Thank you.

A/N: A very late update again! I'm so sorry. Thanks to my loyal readers and to those who left their reviews. I hope you would like this chapter and hopefully, I would finish this one cause I'm excited with my new fic. I have it in my mind already, still Dramione. Please review.Chapter 14Since they lack players, they all agreed to have two chasers instead of three. Draco's team consists of Theo as the keeper, Marcus and Blaise as the chasers, Crabbe and Goyle as the beaters. Harry's team consists of Ron as the keeper, Andrew and Ginny as the chasers, Fred and George as the beaters.The game was intense, with their scores tied; it is up to Draco and Harry to catch the golden snitch to finally end the game. Draco was searching for the snitch when someone called time out."I'm not feeling well." Andrew said as he gently held his head."Dean, take Andrew's place." Harry ordered.Dean nodded and instantly rode on Andrew's broom. Andrew took a seat at the bench beside Hermione.Hermione handed him a towel and a bottle of water from the basket Draco left her. Andrew said his thanks and gave her a sweet smile.Draco witnessed their exchanged and scowled. He called for the game to start and continued to search for the snitch. He stopped at a corner until he spotted something shiny on the left. He glanced at his side and saw the golden snitch flying in circles. He immediately flew to its location when he heard another wooshing sound above him, it was Harry."It feels like Déjà vu." Harry yelled smirking.Draco scowled. "Same scenario but the ending won't be the same. This time, the snitch is mine." He flew faster."Let's see about that." Harry replied flying faster as well.They were both arms away from the golden snitch when Draco noticed something from the corner of his eye. He turned his head and saw Andrew whispering something to Hermione. She began to smile, her smile grew wide and there it was…a blush. Andrew placed his hand on hers and a flower magically appeared. She looked in awe and gave him the sweetest smile. Is it just his imagination? Draco stopped, forgetting about their game. It seemed like everything moved in slow motion like in the movies.His hands were tingling. He found it hard to swallow, like something was blocking his throat. He couldn't explain what he felt. He felt crushed, sad, angry and afraid. Looking at them, watching them from a distance, showed him of what could've been. That's how happy Andrew and Hermione could've been if only he didn't break her heart. He looked away as he felt tears prickling his eyes. He gave one last look at her and flew away.Harry already got the snitch when he saw what happened. He knew Draco wasn't coming back for a while and someone had to tell everyone something. There were cheers and applause as he flew back to the ground holding the snitch up.Hermione went down to meet up all the players and tried to find Draco. Harry turned to face her. "Congratulations Harry. You were great." She gave a quick hug to her best friend. "Where's Draco?"Harry scratched the back of his head, trying to find the right words for a white lie. "When I got the snitch…he…uhh…he received a phone call. He said he had to be somewhere else because it was urgent."She pursed her lips. She knew Harry well that she knew he's hiding something.Harry tried to look innocent. "What? That's what happened."She raised her brow and was about to speak when Ginny stood beside her. "Yeah, I also saw him talking to someone on the phone and then he flew away."Hermione eyed them suspiciously. "I'm not done with you yet… both of you." Then she walked away when Andrew called her.Harry let out his breath and Ginny pulled him aside."Thanks, love. I thought she wouldn't believe me." Harry looked around and saw Hermione having some idle chat with Andrew, Luna and Neville."She didn't. It's me who she believed." She pointed to herself."How did you know I was lying?" Harry whispered.Ginny looked over to her shoulder to Hermione then back at Harry. "I know you too well, and I saw it too."OooOooOMost of the Gryffindors left as soon as the game ended. They didn't even ask why Draco wasn't around. Blaise and Pansy went home because their baby was already tired while Marcus and Theo went on their own place. The only one left in the mansion were Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Andrew."I'm sorry, but Sir Draco said he wouldn't make it tonight. He has to run some errands, but you don't have to worry because he already arranged your safe flight home." Sara said as she entered the living room.Hermione took her things in the room, she thought she would be staying longer, but maybe Draco was really busy that he has to leave without telling her. She went down the stairs and to the porch along with Ginny and Harry. They were waiting for the car that would send them to the airport.Andrew was on his way to the porch as well only to realize that his phone isn't in his pocket. He checked his bag and his coat, none. Then he remembered he placed it on top of the counter in the kitchen when he was drinking a glass of water.He headed to the kitchen and opened the door slightly when he heard someone inside. It was Sara's voice. She seemed like she was talking to someone on the phone. He was about to enter when he heard her mention about Hermione. "I just wished Hermione would stay longer…I know Sir…Poor girl…She has amnesia…Yes, yes. Everything is settled. The private plane is ready and so is her transportation to her flat. She's in the porch waiting with her friends for Billy."Andrew frowned once he heard the word 'amnesia'. Hermione has amnesia? How? When?He tried to open the door further to hear clearer when he heard Hermione calling out for him down the hall. He glanced back and saw her heading his way. "What are you doing there? The car is there already. Let's go.""I was looking for my phone." He said absently. He was still in deep thought, confused about what he just heard a few seconds ago."Oh, where did you last see it?" Hermione started to look around."Kitchen." He pointed to the door to the kitchen. He turned and opened the door widely. Sara just placed the telephone down."Is there something you need Sir Andrew?" Sara asked.Hermione entered the kitchen as well. "He just lost his phone."Sara nodded. "I'll look for it right away."Andrew quickly took his phone on the counter. "There's no need because I found it already. Sara." He gave a short nod and left the kitchen.Hermione gave one last glance at Sara. "It's really nice to see you Sara. Thank you."Sara smiled… her motherly smile that Hermione misses. "I hope to see you again Miss Hermione.""Bye." She whispered and waved at the old lady and left the kitchen.OooOooOThe flight back home was quiet. Hermione sure misses Draco's smirk, even his lame cheesy pick up lines. She looked to her side and saw Ginny and Harry sleeping. Across her was Andrew, who was reading a book but seemed distracted. Maybe she should ask her later what was bothering him when they land. She continued flipping the pages of a magazine.When they landed in the airport, Hermione turned her phone on and checked if Draco sent her a message. She frowned when there weren't any. Honestly, she felt angry and disappointed. He should be asking her if she was okay or did she have a safe flight. He didn't even have the courtesy to say goodbye.Harry and Ginny rode their own car, giving one last hug to Hermione before they drove off. A man in a dark tux accompanied her to another car when Andrew stopped her."I'll drive you home." Andrew insisted.Hermione looked at the man in tux and then at Andrew. This sure would piss Draco off if he knew she went with him instead of the car he provided. She nodded and went to his car. Andrew talked to the man in tux. She saw the look on the man's face. She pitied him because she knew that Draco would be furious. Well, it's his fault. I'm sure I would get his attention this time.The man finally nodded and called other two men to bring Hermione's things to Andrew's car. When everything was settled, Andrew shook the man's hand and went inside the car.During their drive, Hermione was checking her phone. She would check it every five minutes. When her phone rang, she was disappointed that it was from Ginny. She replied that Andrew was bringing her home. All Ginny said was:Need to talk to you. Take care.Hermione shrugged it off. She knew it would be just something about Harry or about their list of events. The message that she was waiting for was Draco's. She opened and closed her phone.Andrew peeked sideways at her. "Still no sign of Draco?"She smiled sheepishly. "That obvious?"Andrew smirked. "Yeah."Hermione turned her phone off and placed it back in her satchel. "You know what? I won't check my phone anymore. He's obviously too busy to even check if I'm okay or if I'm safe."Andrew glanced at her then back at the road. "Maybe he already knows you're safe with me."She snorted. "Yeah." Or maybe too furious that she's with Andrew that he fainted."I want to show you something." He steered the car to the right and then drove somewhere Hermione wasn't quite familiar with.They stopped in a tall building that seemed like a warehouse. "Where are we" Hermione looked around. There weren't any people around and the street was only lit by a single street light.Andrew took out a small device and pointed it in front of them. The metal door opened and he drove inside.It was still dark inside. Andrew stepped out of the car and went to the corner. He pulled some switch and the light went on. Hermione was blinded by the sudden brightness of the room.When her vision was better, Hermione looked around. She gasped. They were surrounded by beautiful large photos. All works of Andrew."Oh my, Andrew…they're beautiful." Hermione said as she walked further inside the room.He smiled as he trailed behind her. "Thanks. This is event I was talking about earlier. I'm putting them up for auction.""You'll raise a huge amount of money for sure." She muttered without looking at him. She was still in awe by the pictures around her. There were photos of beautiful places, of old and young people, of a mother and child. It seems like he really went around a lot.He smirked. "I hope so. The money I'll raise would be donated to St. Mungos."She turned to face him. "That's so generous of you. Now I do pray you raise a huge amount for this photos.""I could raise a huge amount but these photos don't compare to your works. You take brilliant photos."She rolled her eyes playfully. "Well, that part is true."He laughed quietly. She turned back around and continued her way to see more photos when Andrew took her hand. "I'll show you the centerpiece of my collection."He led her to the end of the room. There was a huge canvass covered with white cloth. He pulled the cloth down and let it fall down elegantly on the floor.She gasped. It showed a picture of her eyes. She doesn't remember when he took it. He'd taken a lot of pictures of her before when they went to class but she really doesn't remember this at all."I took this when I told you I love you." He said in a soft voice as if he could read her mind.She was speechless, she did remember that day. She was too shocked and confused when she looked back at him and took a photo of her. That was the time she turned him down."I was hoping you would say that you love me too and that I would capture it on the camera, but I was wrong. I admit, I was hurt, you know…when you didn't say you love me back." He said as he watched her intently. She was staring at her photo not knowing what to say. Her mind wandered back in the time, to Draco and to why is Andrew bringing this up. "And, I just realized that I didn't ask you why."Okay, could he really read my mind?Hermione looked down for a moment and then back to her picture. "I have a lot of reasons" She mumbled."Like amnesia."She turned to face him, surprised. She doesn't know if it was a statement or a question."I heard Sara."Oh no, what else did he hear?"Andrew-"He ran his hand through his dark brown hair. "That was the reason, wasn't it?""I-I" she was out of words. How could she explain to him that it was all a lie?He continued. "Because if it was - you should've told me. I would've understood. I could help you. I would slow things down until you finally trust me enough to love you. I could wait until you could love me back. You didn't give me a chance Hermione." She could hear a hint of hurt in his voice.Hermione let out some air. She should tell him the truth. "It's not the reason."Andrew let out his hand in front of him. "Then what?"It's now or never. "Andrew, I don't have amnesia. The reason why I turned you down is because I was hurt by someone I really love."He knotted his brows. "I don't understand."Hermione sighed. "I was inlove with Draco Malfoy." By the mention of Draco's name, he looked disappointed. She continued. "We were supposed to get married but, he left me in the aisle. I was really hurt, broken, that I find it hard to love again…to trust again.""The amnesia?"She was tired. She was tired of all the lies she made, it became bigger and bigger that even the people she cared about are getting hurt because of it. "I pretended to have amnesia when I saw Draco almost two years. I didn't know what came through me. I panicked and had mixed emotions when I laid my eyes on him again."Andrew now looked even more disappointed. "So…you're lying to him? To everyone? For what? Revenge?"She looked embarrassed. "No, Ginny and the rest know the truth. The ones who I lie to are Draco and his friends. And… I know it's very immature but yeah, that was my plan… but…things changed."He looked away, clenched his jaw then back to her. "You love him again."She didn't say anything. She wasn't really sure of what she felt for Draco."I know you know what you're doing. You have some reasons that I would never understand. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. I just thought amnesia was the reason why you didn't love me back.""You're easy to love Andrew. It's just that…he already has my heart."He looked hurt. He cleared his throat. "If you don't mind… I just want to know what happens after? When you're finally sure that you love him again?"She shrugged. "I don't know.""During the game, I whispered how beautiful you are. You were always beautiful, but now…you're glowing, your smile is different, like it has more warmth than it had before." He paused. "And, as much as I hate to admit, I know who caused the glow in you."She looked at him."I know because… when I first met you… I saw the sadness, the emptiness in those eyes." He pointed to her eyes then to the photo behind her. "But as you watch him in the game, hell, as you look at him every day, those eyes brighten. You're different…in a good way.""The truth is I'm confused." She whispered, her voice cracking as tears start to fill her eyes."You shouldn't be, Hermione. You love him. You're too stubborn and too prideful to admit it." He pulled her closer and wrapped his arms around her. "He won. I know he did from the moment I saw you two together in the bistro." He sighed and kissed her head. "I would die for your love, Hermione. I would do anything for you to love me but I know that's impossible.""I'm sorry." She whispered. "I know someday you'll find the right one for you."He smiled sadly. "The right one is in my arms right now…it's just that…the timing is off."She pulled away and looked up to him. "Andrew-""I'll always love you, Hermione Granger." He took her hand, kissed it gently. "It's time to go home."He glanced at her. She was looking at the floor. "So, would you be my photographer for this event?"She looked up and smiled. "Of course."He grinned and led her back to the car. He opened the car door for her."Thank you." She muttered as he entered the car.He smiled and started the engine.He drove back to her flat. She forgot to turn her phone on and to check if there are any messages or calls from Draco. She just sat quietly and took this opportunity to think of ways to tell Draco the truth.They stopped in front of her flat. Andrew went out first and opened her door. She stepped out and thanked him. She went up to the stairs and looked for the keys in her satchel. When the keys were in her grasped, she turned and found Andrew standing face to face at her because he was in a lower step than her."Thanks again." She said. "I feel better."He half smiled. "You'll feel better if you're not hiding anything."She nodded. "I know. I'll tell him, I promise."They stood in awkward silence. "Uh- Hermione?" From the light coming from the street light, she noticed he was blushing. She didn't notice how cute he was when he blushes.She prodded him to continue."Just one last-first kiss." He whispered as he leaned in closer. Before she could move away, his lips were gently planted on hers.Hermione was surprised, not only because he stole a kiss from her but she felt how soft his lips were. She felt her eyes flutter closed and gently placed her hand on her shoulder. He kissed her deeply as he snaked his arms around her waist.She was vulnerable, confused, and angry at Draco. The face of Draco entered her mind and she knew what they were doing was wrong. She needed to stop this. She pulled away."Good night." She said through ragged breath. She turned and opened the door with her wand instead. She rushed inside her flat.Andrew placed his finger on his lips. He always imagined how soft her lips were. It was a bittersweet kiss and he knew that it would never happen again.He smiled at the empty space where she once stood. "Good bye."He walked down the steps and to his car. He gave one last glance at her flat and drove off.If only Hermione paid attention, she would notice someone watching them from a few feet away. Draco was clenching his fist as he sat in his car. He was supposed to meet Hermione because he felt bad for not saying good bye to her. He tried to call her and even send her messages but her phone was off. When Simon, the man in tux, told him Andrew offered her a ride home, he was really furious. He flew immediately back in London. He's been waiting for five hours and was worried that something might happen to her. When they arrived, he was about to step out of his car when they kissed.He felt tears rolling down his cheeks. It really hurts. Maybe it wouldn't compare to what she felt before but fuck, this shit hurts.Maybe it is time for me to go.OooOooOHermione was still flushed by her kiss with Andrew. She entered the living room when she saw Ginny sitting down on the couch. "Hey, why are you here?"Ginny sighed. "I'm sorry. Harry and I lied to you earlier."Hermione dropped her bags. "What is it?""It's about Draco."A:N/ I didn't check for errors. Haha. I really wanted to update my fic already. It's been a loooooong time since chapter thirteen. I was supposed to post a chapter fourteen but I didn't like it so I started all over again. I think I have a few chapters left on my sleeves. I don't think I could write that much cause I still have a lot to learn. I admit it. Thank you for the people who followed this fic and who listed this as their favorite. Some people also listed me as their fave author. Please review. I think there should be an encounter between Andrew and Draco, don't you think?

A/N: Okay, so it took me some time…a lot of time to think for this chapter. I had to write and re-write a lot of things because I would like the flow then boom, I hate it again. So sorry about that. Thank you for the lovely reviews for chapter 14. Again, please review and I hope to gain more followers and favorites.Disclaimer: I don't own HP.Chapter 15"What about Draco?" Hermione looked worried. The first thing that came through her mind was that he was in danger. She rushed to get her phone in her satchel. She forgot to turn it on again. She waited for her phone to boot up. "Come on come on come on" she whispered.Ginny sighed. "How will I put this?" She thought for a moment and looked back up at her friend who was waiting for her Blackberry to start. "Draco saw Andrew whisper something to you and I guess he was jealous because you both looked so happy – so there." She held her hands in front of her gesturing 'there you go'.Hermione ignored her friend. All she ever wanted to know was if Draco was okay and if he finally sent her a message or called her. When her phone was open, she received a text from Ginny and 20 voice mails all from Draco. She gasped and listened to the first voice mail. It was when she arrived back in the airport in London. Maybe the signal was poor so she didn't receive it as soon as they landed.'I'm sorry for not saying good bye Hermione. I assure that you'll have a safe flight home. I'll see you soon. I just have to do something.'She pressed another button for the next voicemail. It was the time when she turned her phone off.'Hermione, I just heard that you didn't ride with Simon. Why did you go with Andrew? Where are you? Call me.''Your phone is fucking turned off! Where are you? I'm going to fly back there.''Where the fuck are you? I'm in London. I'll be in your studio in a while.''You're not here. I swear Hermione, if something happened to you, I'll never forgive myself. Please, please call me.' He sounds desperate.She was pacing in her small living room. Most of his voicemail's were all swearing, asking her where she is and who's she's with. Ginny was watching her, concern written all over her face. Hermione's eyes were filled with tears. He's gone through a lot of trouble to look for her.'Hermione, please call me. I just need to hear your voice. I already called the police to look for you, hell, I'll even ask for the Auror's help. Andrew is not in his flat yet, and so are you. Potter doesn't know where you are or any of your friends. I don't know where the weaslette is either. Is she with you?' She heard him whisper 'Fuck. I hope she's with you.' He might've lowered his phone until his voice became louder again. 'Answer your damn phone!."'I'm waiting here in front of your flat. The police said it's better to wait here in case you come home.''HERMIONE.''I'll go to Andrew's flat again. If you're home, call me. I'm worried. If this is just a silent treatment for not saying good bye, then I'm really sorry. I would never do that again. Just please, please call me. Tell me where you are.'Tears fell freely from her eyes. She pressed the button for the last voicemail.'I'm sorry, Hermione. Please, come back to me.'She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and pressed a button to call Draco. It was ringing. She looked at Ginny. "How long were you here?"Ginny checked her watch. "An hour. I ran some errands in the burrow then at the studio in Diagon Alley."Hermione redialed Draco's number. It was still ringing. She turned to face Ginny again. "Draco didn't stop by while you were here?" Ginny shook her head."No cars outside?"Ginny shook her head again. "You were the one who came from outside. You didn't notice anything?"Hermione gasped and dropped her phone on the floor. How could she notice anything? She was in a middle of a kiss with Andrew. She placed her hands to cover her mouth. What if Draco was there and he saw everything?"Oh no." She whispered.Ginny stood. "What is it?"Hermione apparated immediately, leaving Ginny alone in the living room.oOoOoOoHermione stood in front of his flat. She knocked. "Draco?" She tried to open his door but it was locked. She opened it with her wand, she heard a small click. Draco still didn't block her magic from his flat. She rushed inside and searched everywhere, hoping she would see him. No one was there.She took her phone and called Andrew. "Hey Andrew. Is Draco there?...I'm looking for him… Yeah he flew back here in London…. Okay. Call me if ever he passed by. Thanks. Bye."She apparated to Malfoy Manor, no one was there either. It was only the house elf.She called his friends and felt embarrassed for calling them at this hour. Still no sign of Draco.She apparated back to her flat. Ginny was still there. "You found him?"Hermione bit her lip and shook her head. She felt tears filling her eyes again. Ginny pulled her into a hug. "Maybe he's just staying in one of his mansions and resting. He may be too tired trying to look for you. You go rest." She led her to her room.Ginny tucked her in. "He'll come back. He always does. He loves you that much."With her words, Hermione cried harder. Ginny was right. He loves her so much that he does everything for her. Then what does he get back? He's been worried sick about her. She shouldn't have shut her phone off."You should go back. Harry might be worried about you." She whispered through sobs.Ginny nodded. "Yeah, he called a while ago. But, are you sure you don't want some company?"She gave a sad smile. "I'll be fine. Go."Ginny brushed her hair and stood. She gave one last glance at Hermione and shut the door quietly.Hermione stared at the ceiling thinking where Draco could be. Of all the mansions he has, he could be staying in one of those. She covered her eyes with her arms. Where are you Draco?She dropped her arms to her sides and sat back up. She took her phone from the bedside table and called him one last time. It was still his voicemail. She hit the end button and threw her phone on the bed. She stood up and took a small parchment on her desk. She took her pen and wrote to him.Draco, come back to me.-HShe called Dorothy, her owl, and in an instant, it flew inside her room. She gave it some seeds and attached her note to its leg. "Send this to Draco." Hermione held Dorothy and let it fly away out her window.oOoOoOo"It's snowing mum!" The little girl cried. Her cute little hands were placed on the glass as she watched the tiny snowflakes fall gracefully to the ground."Yes, dear, it's beautiful." The woman smiled and turned to face Hermione again. "Sorry about that, Susan really likes the snow." She smiled once more, showing fine wrinkles in the corner of her eyes."That's okay. I love the snow too." Hermione smiled back. "Hey Susan, I have a gift for you. Wait here." She went inside her office where she couldn't be seen by her customers and took a couple of snowflakes in her window. She magically transformed them into a platinum bracelet.She went back out and Susan was jumping up and down while clapping her hands. "What is it?"Hermione knelt down in front of her so they were face to face. "I only give special gifts to the kids who behaved well during the shoot. You were well behaved right?" The little girl nodded.She placed the bracelet in the little girl's wrist. "A special snowflake for a special someone."The little girl squealed in delight and gave Hermione a quick hug. "I love it, thanks." Just then someone came inside the studio. They all looked who it was and it was Andrew. Hermione stood. "Hey.""Is he your boyfriend?" Susan asked. The woman gave her a look. "Susan."Andrew grinned. "No, Susan. I'm just her friend."The woman took Susan's hand and thanked Hermione again. "We have to go now Susan. Thanks Hermione.""You're welcome Margaret. Bye Susan." Hermione waved her hand.The little girl waved at both of them.Hermione went back to her office, Andrew followed. "So, what are you doing here?"He shrugged. "Still no Draco?"She gave him a look but finally shook her head. "Day five and still no Draco." She paused. "Is that why you're here? To check if Draco is around?"He chuckled. "No. I already know where he is."She pretended to study the photos on top of her desk. "In Paris, I know."He sighed. "Ah, the city of love. How did you know?""Theo can't keep his mouth shut." She slammed her hand on the desk and looked irritated. "Draco won't to talk to me."Andrew sat on the chair in front of her. "I know where he'll be tonight."She raised her brow.He smirked. "But I won't tell you."She rolled her eyes. "That's okay. Even if I know where he is, he wouldn't talk to me anyway. If you're done bugging me, you may go." She took the pictures on her desk and stood. Andrew didn't move. "Well?"Andrew held his hands up and walked to the door. He turned on his heel to face her again. "Remember the first time I saw you and Draco together?" He grinned some more. "Have a nice day Hermione."oOoOoOo"He'll be at the Richards' Gala." Hermione sighed as she flopped down the couch."How did you know?" Ginny bit on her slice of pizza."Andrew.""Oh I can't wait for the fight." Luna teased.Hermione threw a pillow at her. "There won't be a fight.""So are you going?" Ginny asked.oOoOoOo"So are you going?" Theo peeked up through his book."Of course I am." Draco sneered. "All of the wealthiest family would be there. Great place to look for investors.""I saw Hermione the other day." Theo said bluntly.Draco froze for a while then continued to fix his tie. He tried to bite his tongue to fish for more information. He waited for Theo to continue but he didn't say more. He cleared his throat "And?""I thought you'll never ask." Theo chuckled, receiving a glare from Draco. "I said you're in Paris but she doesn't know you're here in Scotland for Andrew's Gala."He scowled by the mention of Andrew's name. "So, she asked about me?""Of course she did.""H-how did she ask you? Was she worried? Angry?"Theo thought for a moment and placed his book down. "I really don't remember. But I recall she said 'How's Draco? Is he still here in London?' Then I answered then she left."Draco frowned. Well, that's not what he expected. He expected that she would be furious that he hasn't called or even send her a note. Maybe she really is with Andrew now that she doesn't care about him anymore."Andrew would be there at the gala right?" Theo asked, trying to start a conversation."No he won't be there." Draco looked annoyed, both at Andrew's name and Theo's stupid question. "Of course he'll be there. After all, it's his family's gala."Theo held his hands up. "I'm just trying to have a small talk. You don't like to talk about Hermione anyways." He took his book back again and started to read.Draco turned to face him. He was furious. "I didn't say that. I still love her.""But you don't talk to her." Theo said as a matter of fact, still reading his book.He opened his mouth then shut it back again. He faced the mirror and continued straightening his tie. "I have reasons."Theo looked bored and shut his book. "So, what would happen to Andrew tonight?"Draco's lips slowly raised into a smirk. "We'll see."oOoOoOoThe Richard's ballroom was bigger than the Great Hall of Hogwarts. It was lit by three huge chandeliers with diamonds and Swarovski's. The ceiling was enchanted to show the view of the winter night's sky. There were tables covered with gold satin cloth which matches the plates, spoons, forks, and goblets, you get the idea. There were white and yellow roses and garlands everywhere.The music was soft and the food was excellent. Everyone was either in deep conversation, bragging about their riches or dancing. All guests were dressed in white, good thing Draco got the memo."So, what's the plan?" Theo said in a low voice."Just enjoy the night." Draco smirked and headed towards a group of ladies in the corner of the ballroom."Alright." Theo sighed and joined him.oOoOo"Andrew, darling, there you are." Victoria kissed her son's cheek."Where's father?" He craned his neck to look around. "Oh, I saw him. Excuse me."He went to the corner of the room and joined a small group of bachelors and bachelorettes. He snaked his arm around a brunette. "Hello beautiful.""Andrew. You're here. Remember Draco?" The brunette giggled.Andrew thought for a moment. "Draco who?"Draco glared at him."Draco Malfoy, you silly boy." The girl gently hit his arm and giggled.Draco smirked and glanced at his left. He saw Theo busy with a blonde woman."Oh, Draco Malfoy. Who would ever forget that name?" Andrew grinned. "I think I know one."Draco chuckled. "Yeah, I know one too. And you are?" He played alongThe girls around them were confused."Andrew Richards." Andrew held out his hand.Draco looked bored. "Pleasure."Andrew dropped his hand and pulled the girl closer to him. "So, who's your date Draco? I thought you have one when I gave you your invitation?"Draco put on his façade, the façade Malfoy's known for. "My date are these girls. Georgina and Daphne." He placed his arms around the two girls beside him.Andrew gritted his teeth. He had to do what he has planned. He'll do this for Hermione.Draco looked around. "How about you Andrew? What about your date? I heard you have a new girlfriend and the girl in your arms right now is not the one I'm referring to."Andrew shrugged and kissed the girl's cheek. "Well, she isn't around isn't she?"Draco dropped his arms around the girls and clenched his fist. "Excuse me ladies."He made a bee line to the balcony. Andrew followed him.The cold night air was touching their faces. Draco glared at the couple who was sitting at the iron bench sending them back inside the ballroom. He knew Andrew was just behind him."What the fuck do you want?" Draco said through gritted teeth, his back facing Andrew."I'm just doing this for Hermione." Andrew said in a flat voice."How dare you cheat on her." Draco finally faced him sending him a death glare. He clenched his fists, stopping himself from reaching his wand and sending him the unforgivable."You don't know anything." Andrew placed his hand on his pocket."I know everything." Draco growled."I'm not sure about that." Andrew pretended to take a lint off his coat."What do you mean?""It's not my place to tell. But all I'm ever gonna say to you is she's not my girlfriend."Draco looked confused. He went back to the night when he saw them kiss."It was a first-last goodbye kiss." Andrew muttered answering to Draco's thoughts.Andrew took a few steps forward. "I knew that was the reason why you won't talk to her. Well, that's the problem with you Draco. You always assume things. You never ask." He held his hand out. "You won. She's yours. She's always been yours."Draco looked at his hand then back up at him. He took a step closer and closed his fist. He threw a punch on Andrew's jaw. Andrew fell on the ground and spit some blood on the snow. Now he knew why Hermione did that to him during their third year in Hogwarts. It felt good. Andrew wiped his hand with his hand and stood up. "I deserve that. But you deserve this too." He threw a punch on Draco's nose.Draco saw drops of blood on his shirt. He pushed Andrew and they were inside the ballroom. There were gasps and screams from other guests. They fell on one table and broke it together with all the plates and goblets. They threw punches to each other when they heard two women scream their names.Draco and Andrew were both stupefied by Andrew's father. Narcissa and Victoria looked very displeased by their son's behavior. Theo rushed to them and brought them to one of the guest rooms."We're very disappointed with you two." Narcissa folded her arms."You embarrassed us all." Victoria paced in the room. "What is this all about Andrew?"Andrew was quiet. He threw his cold towel on the floor. He stood and glanced at Draco. "Go back to her before I change my mind." He stormed out of the room."I'll go check on him." Victoria muttered and followed him."Draco-" Narcissa began."Cissy, I think we should leave him alone." Lucius muttered. He led his wife out of the room and looked at Theo. "You too."Before Theo left the room he glanced back at Draco. "He lost mate, it's your call now."oOoOoOoDraco stood and looked out the window. This time of the year is Hermione's favorite season. He doesn't know why she loves the snow but all he knows is she's fascinated by it.He opened the window and caught a snowflake and magically turned it to a bracelet. He did that once to Hermione when they were in a park. She danced around as the snow fell on her face. He made the bracelet and gave it to her."A special snowflake for a special someone." He whispered. The bracelet then formed back to ice and it melted in his palm.He took a small parchment out of his coat pocket. It was the note Hermione sent him. He read it once more and placed it back on his pocket. He closed his eyes briefly and opened it again. "Hermione." He whispered.oOoOoOo"Good bye Hermione. See you tomorrow okay?" Ginny left her flat, Luna waved goodbye.Hermione closed the door and started to clean the pizza box on the floor. She washed the glass and threw the empty bottle of wine in the trash.She was getting ready to bed when she heard someone knock. She rushed back down to see who it was. She opened the door and was surprised to be pushed against the wall and felt soft lips on hers. She knew who owns that scent. She pushed him gently as her eyes filled with tears. "You came back."Draco smiled at her and wiped the tears in her eyes. "I never left."He kissed her once again, more softly this time. He rested his forehead on hers. "I love you Hermione Granger."A/N: And their back. Haha. I hope there aren't any violent reactions. Please review. Thanks. Sorry for picking 'Dorothy' as Hermione's owl. I know it sounds stupid. I just can't think of any name for an owl. REVIEW PLEASE. I just used 'Blackberry' as Hermione's phone. I don't own it either. By the way, which celebrity do you portray as Andrew?

A/N: Wow! Thanks for the reviews. Thanks for those who listed me as fave author, who listed this as their fave story and also those who followed this fic. I must say I'm greatly thankful to all of you. I read my previous chapter and again, spotted some errors. I'm sorry about that. I just go on with typing my fic that I'm too excited to upload it once I finished. So anyway, I hope you like this chapter. I might have a few chapters left. Maybe it would only be below twenty chapters or twenty.Chapter 16"Hermione let's go. We have this shoot at ten!" Ginny called as she placed her bag on the couch. She dusted some floo powder off her sleeves. "Hermione!"She heard a door slam and Hermione ran down the stairs ignoring her completely as she made a bee line to the kitchen to get some oatmeal cookies on the jar. Her friend gave her the look. The 'what-are-you-waiting-for?' look.Ginny swiftly took her bag and followed her dear friend to the car. "Did something happen last night?"Hermione grinned and went inside the car. "Let's go."Ginny shrugged and sat down at the passenger's seat and they drove off to their location."Is this the right place?" Hermione mumbled as she slowly parked the car to the side. Once they stopped, Ginny stepped out and took their bags. "Yep, this is it."Hermione stepped out as well and took the other bags in the trunk. They both struggled with their huge bags as they were heavy with their equipment. This is a huge shoot. Some wealthy woman asked for them personally just this morning and was willing to pay ten times their regular fee."It looks like there's no one here." Hermione whispered.Ginny checked her watch. "We're thirty minutes early. Just enough time to set everything up."Hermione nodded. Ginny was right. They should be prepared before the event starts. She looked around. It was a huge garden with tall shrubs and roses of different colors surrounding them. The floor was stone and there was a fountain by the corner. Balloons were floating above them. They knew magic was keeping them still. There were tables around as if it was like a birthday party, children's party to be precise.They were almost done with the set up when they heard footsteps from the corner. She gasped as the man she recognized came out of one of the shrubs. "Draco? What are you doing here?"Draco was holding a small birthday cake with a single pink candle in the middle. Harry came out as well and he lit the candle. They were soon followed by their friends.Hermione was speechless. She glanced at Ginny who just shrugged and waved at Harry. "Hi, Love."Draco took a few steps closer to her. "Happy birthday, Hermione."She leaned forward. "It's not my birthday."He grinned. "I know. But all your memories are lost. So, I've been thinking. Why try to remember everything when we could just make new ones." He was gazing at her. "And I want to be part of your new memories. Happy first birthday Hermione."She looked around. Everyone was happy to see her. Everyone was waiting for her response. She spotted Ginny who was ushering her to blow the candle. Maybe Ginny told her friends about the fake amnesia. Oh no, the fake amnesia. Now it all came back to her. She needed to say something. Maybe she could just confess it tomorrow. She doesn't want to disappoint Draco and ruin his surprise again.She inhaled deeply, closed her eyes and blew the candle. She heard applause.oOoOo"Happy eleventh birthday." Draco said using the microphone. He magically turned the venue to what looks like the Great hall, only smaller. "Today we were given this." A couple of acceptance letter from Hogwarts flew above their heads and landed on their laps. Hermione opened the letter and saw her name written on it. Harry gave her hand a little squeeze and Ron gave her a warm smile.Draco continued. "Because of this letter, our lives have changed forever." He smiled. "This is where we all met.""You were a git that time Malfoy." Theo yelled from one corner."He still is" Ron added. There were nods from others."Hey, I've changed weasel." Draco argued.Ron raised his glass. "Exactly."There was a burst of laughter.oOoOoNow the garden went back to its old state. Only now that it was decorated with lights and white ribbons. There were Christmas lights everywhere and there was a hint of soft music surrounding them. Draco pushed a cart with a three layered cake. There was a candle that looks like a number fifteen. "Happy fifteenth birthday love." Once she blew the candle, all their clothes were turned to what they wore during the Yule ball. Ron's horrid look when he remembered what he wore that time. He took his wand and changed it to a crisp tux.Hermione didn't notice where Draco went. Everyone started to dance to the music. She was in the middle of the dance floor. Maybe Draco would want to repeat the events. She craned her neck in search for him. She even feared that Viktor would show up. She felt someone tap her shoulder. She gasped and slowly turned around. Please not Viktor. Please not Viktor. Please please please.Draco gazed at her. "You're even more beautiful than that night at the ball." He took his hand and bowed slowly. "May I have this dance?"She smiled and took his hand. He pulled her closer. He could smell her lavender scent, the scent he's been missing for a long time. They started to sway to the music. Draco turned his head to face her. She truly was a beautiful woman. He was just too prideful to admit his crush on her during their year at Hogwarts and because of the fact of his father's principles. If it weren't for all of that shit he would've asked her for a dance. Maybe they would've even been together since then. But, to think of it, those days in the past doesn't matter. What happened during their school days would never be altered. What matters is the present. What matters is he saw her in that speed dating event. He thanked Merlin for that event. That's what made them together. That's when he truly opened his heart.He pulled her closer and cherished the moment. She leaned her head on his chest. "Close your eyes." He whispered. She did as she was told."They said when you close your eyes… that's when you know what you really feel in your heart." He added. Hermione wrapped both her arms to his shoulder. She could feel tears prickling in her eyes."I hope that this time, all the anger in your heart would be gone. I hope that this time, it would be full of love and happiness." He paused. "I love you Hermione."oOoOoOo"Twenty, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three" Everyone cheered and clapped their hands as Hermione blew all the candles."Happy twenty third birthday!"Hermione looked around. She saw her friends, old and new. This is by far the best day of her life. She celebrated all her years in just a day. She glanced to her side. Draco was smiling while cutting her a piece of cake. Should she ruin this? Should she ruin it by saying the truth?She felt a lump on her throat. No. I'll tell him some other time.oOoOoOoThe next day, Hermione was on her way home when she noticed a crowd in front of her flat. She stopped midway and checked what where they going on about. She tried to push her way in and then she saw it. Her house was covered with colorful post its.There were post-its in the door. It says:I LOVE YOU BECAUSE…And all the post-its that were on her wall were the reasons why he loves her. She knew who did it because of the hand writing.She saw one 'You have the best pick-up lines.' And another. 'You are the first and last person I think of day and night.'Ginny came out from her flat. She handed her a post-it. It says 'I love you.'"I don't know if you still have forgotten why he loves you.' Ginny giggled and went back inside.Hermione held the post-it in her chest. She bit her lip to stop squealing out loud. She went inside her flat and there were even more post-its. She took her phone in her satchel.oOoOo"Sir, I need you to sign something." A blonde girl handed Draco a folder.Draco was about to open the folder when his phone rang. He smirked and answered it."Hermione?""Do you know that I could demand you of trespassing?"He frowned. "B-but." Was his surprise too much?Hermione smiled. "It's because you just keep entering my mind."He sighed in relief and chuckled. "You should go buy a life vest.""Why? Are we going to swim?"He grinned. "No. You might drown from the love I have for you."The blonde girl couldn't help but giggle with what she heard. She never expected that the Draco Malfoy could come up with these lines. She cleared her throat. "Sir, the papers?"Draco glanced at her distracted. "What?""The papers, Sir."Draco nodded and signed.oOoOoOoThe small bell hanging just above the door rang. She missed that sound whenever the door opens. Although it always ring when there is a new customer, this ring is different. The moment that door rang, she knew who would be greeting her. She bit her lip trying to suppress her giggle."Hermione, your chauffer is here." Ginny teased."Okay. Wait." Hermione turned her computer off and took her purse.She wore her coat and headed out her office. She saw Draco waiting for her by the door. He held out a single tulip behind him. "For you."She smiled. "Thanks."He offered his arm. "Shall we go?"She nodded and snaked her arm around his. She waved good bye to Ginny and Elena.Once they were out, she felt the cool wind touch her face. The view before here was amazing. There were Christmas lights and garlands everywhere. She could hear a group of people singing Christmas Carols by the corner. Draco held his finger up. "Wait. I think that's not enough." He peered down at the tulip she was holding.He led her to the back of his car and opened the trunk. She was in awe. The trunk was full of white tulips. He placed an arm around her shoulder. "You love it?"She nodded."Hey, are you and issue?" Draco glanced down at her.She looked up. "No. Why?""Because all I want for Christmas ISSUE." He gave his award winning smile. "Get it? All I want ISSUE."She snorted. If she were to be truly honest, she did miss those lines he makes. Even though some are really corny, she found it sweet. She missed everything about him. She's happy that everything is coming into place. She frowned. Well, there is still one thing she should do."What's wrong?" Draco asked, concern filling his voice.She shook her head slightly. "Am I that demanding?""What? No." He looked gobsmacked. "Why?"She grinned. "Because I wish for you every minute.""Ahh." Draco smiled. "That's a good one."So she can't tell him now. She just can't find the right time and the right words. They just had a fight. The right time would come…eventually. Maybe tomorrow again or the day after that."Where do you want to eat?" Draco shut the trunk down and led her to the passenger's seat.Once her door was shut, she started to place her seat belt on. She watched him as he gracefully went to the other side of the car. This feels right. Is it really necessary to tell him the truth? 'YES' she could hear her conscience speaking. "Shut up." She whispered."What was that?" Draco dusted off some snow on his sleeves. She helped him. "Nothing.""So? Where do you like to eat?" He placed his seatbelt on.She thought for a moment. "Somewhere cozy."He smirked and took her hand. He gave it a kiss and let it go so he could start the car. "Okay."oOoOoOo"Draco, hurry up!" Hermione waved at him.He ran as fast as he could. Why won't they just use his car or hers? Why do they have to ride the tube?She took his harm and pulled him to a small space in the corner. She took her camera out and took a picture of them both. "This is your first time in a public muggle transportation. Let's make it count."She placed her camera back inside her bag. She couldn't help but grin at the events last night. The horror in his face when she said she would like to ride the tube for a change. Well, if he wanted to make new memories, then they should do this. She stifled a laugh. Draco glanced at her and playfully rolled his eyes. "Yes love, it's funny. Go on. Laugh all you want."Hermione tried to compose herself but she really can't stop laughing. "Sorry. It's just…so funny." She pinched her nose. Her mum used to say it could help you stop laughing. When she seemed to finally control herself, she let her nose go. She sighed."That thing really worked?" Draco looked amused. "What kind of spell is that?"She bit her lip trying to stop her laughter. "It's called the mother's cure."Draco thought for a moment then realized what she really meant. She started to laugh again. "Hey, Hermione, I think I should try that thing with your nose. It might work better."She placed her hand up. "No." She gave a pointed look at him. "No."He pulled her closer while she tried to push away from him. "Draco, I'm warning you."She turned around, his arms still on her waist. She covered her nose with her palms. He sighed. "Okay, no more nose pinching."She glanced to her side. "Promise?"He nodded. She started to relax and placed her arms down on top of his. She leaned her head back to her chest and looked out the window. He started to look around as well. Everyone was looking at him. He was wearing his casual clothes, a Gucci shirt and shoes and gray jeans to complete the whole outfit. He looked like a model. He might've even heard someone giggle.Hermione felt his arms tighten. She looked up to him. "Is there something wrong?"He shook his head and kissed her temple. "It's nothing."He's been planning this all night. He doesn't know if this was too soon or just the right time. He was nervous. He wasn't able to sleep all night because of his plan. They've been seeing each other now for almost ten months since their encounter in Flourish and Blotts. It's December and in a few days, it would be Christmas. If things would work well, then he wouldn't need any presents.Music began to play. She was familiar with the song. Then she remembered. It was the song that was playing when they danced a few days ago in the garden.She turned to face him. He glanced down and grinned. He started to sing to her. "The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful stop me and steal my breath." He managed to turn her around and once again pulled her closer. "And tell me that we belong together…" She giggled. They managed to dance within the small space they have."I'll be your crying shoulder. I'll be love suicide." They sang softly. "I'll be better when I'm older. I'll be the greatest fan of your life."Draco placed his hand on her shoulders. "If there is one thing I would like to bring back, it would be the day that I met you… the day that I loved you. Even if I have to do it over and over again, I would. I love you."Hermione placed her arm around his neck and pulled him closer. She placed her lips on his. He wrapped his arms around her waist and deepened the kiss. She pulled away once she was out of breath. "I love you too Draco."He smiled blinking the tears away. This was the first time she told him she loves him since the amnesia incident. He finally won her heart. She finally trusts him. She loves him again.The tube stopped and they reached their destination. "Let's go." He took her arm and led the way.oOoOoOoShe didn't know where they are. All she knows is that they are in an ice skating rink. Draco glided to her side."How did you learn to skate?" Hermione asked perplexed."My mother." He grinned. "But this isn't the surprise." Draco took her waist and led her to the corner of the rink. She saw a floating broom. She realized what his surprise is."No way." She stopped which caused Draco to trip slightly."I got you." He whispered and started to skate again. She clenched her hands on his. Her breath started to go short.She took a seat. Draco took out his wand and transformed her skates back to her shoes. Draco took a seat behind her and changed his skates as well. Hermione was holding her breath. "Breath love. I'm here." He placed his arm around her and they both held the broom.She let out her breath and nodded. "I'm ready." They flew higher just a few inches above the rink and started to move around."See? It's just like skating…only better." He muttered in her ear.She was still holding the broom. She could feel her heart beat fast. She's still scared of heights."Relax."She sighed and felt the wind in her face."Just think that we're skating."She shut her eyes close then opened it again. She reminded herself the time they skated which was just a few hours ago. She began to relax, a smile forming her lips."There you go." Draco smirked.He let the broom fly higher and higher. She tensed a bit. Draco stopped and held her closer. She let out a loud sigh "I'm alright."He led the broom high above the rink. It now looked like a white spot surrounded by trees and lights. She could feel the cool breeze blowing her hair. She could see the London Eye. It looked wonderful under the moonlight. This is like a dream… Perfect moon, perfect view, the world just below them, her man wrapping his arms around her. If this is a dream, she doesn't want to wake up."It's beautiful." She sighed."Yes it is." Draco was glanced at her. She truly is beautiful.He took out a small box from his pocket. It was the box that he was supposed to give her before Andrew showed up in her flat and joined the quidditch game. He took what's inside and placed the box back in his pocket. He held it in front of her so she wouldn't look down. She gasped. It was a platinum gold necklace with a circular emerald pendant and a diamond in the middle.He pointed to the diamond. "This is you." Then he pointed to the circular pendant surrounding it. "This is me. You see? I'm here to love you and protect you always."She glanced to face him and kissed him in the lips. He placed the necklace on her neck tracing his fingers as he did."Every time you tell me you love me, it feels so right that it makes me love you more." Hermione muttered.Draco smiled. "It's time."He pointed across them. She turned her head and saw fireworks. It continued on and on until it formed into letters.Will you marry me Hermione?She gasped and glanced back at him showing her eyes filled with tears.He held on his breath. It might be too soon. She just told him she loves him. Isn't he rushing this too much?She could feel butterflies in her stomach. This is happening again. He's asking her if she wants to marry him. Of course she does. She loves him so much. She never stopped loving him. It was always there, it never left. Their timing might be right. She's out of words. She nodded."Yes?" Draco grinned.Hermione wiped tears from her eyes. "Yes."oOoOoOoHermione was in her room. She took out a box under her bed. The box contained all the post-its he placed on her flat. She read them again and saw that post-it 'I love you because you're always honest.'She placed it down and held her necklace.It's time to tell him the truth.A/N: Merry Christmas! Errors? Haha. Didn't check anymore. This is my gift for all of you. I'm close to the ending. I hope you like it. Thank you for the support. Please review. Oh, the song in their 'Yule ball' and in the tube is "I'll be of Edwin Mccain." I kept repeating Hermione's thought of telling Draco the truth. I just want you to see how she struggles every day how to tell him the fake amnesia.

A/N: I'm almost done with this fic. I guess chapter 18 is the last chapter, I'm not sure yet. But I won't exceed to 20 chapters. I'm excited for my new fic! I've done the first chapter already and yes, still Dramione. Thanks for the review! PS, I placed a recap of chapter 16.Previously on MY AMNESIA GIRL:Draco placed his hand on her shoulders. "If there is one thing I would like to bring back, it would be the day that I met you… the day that I loved you. Even if I have to do it over and over again, I would. I love you.""Every time you tell me you love me, it feels so right that it makes me love you more." Hermione muttered.Draco smiled. "It's time."He pointed across them. She turned her head and saw fireworks. It continued on and on until it formed into letters.Will you marry me Hermione?She gasped and glanced back at him showing her eyes filled with tears. Hermione wiped tears from her eyes. "Yes."Hermione was in her room. She took out a box under her bed. The box contained all the post-its he placed on her flat. She read them again and saw that post-it 'I love you because you're always honest.'She placed it down and held her necklace.It's time to tell him the truth.Chapter 17When Hermione woke up the next day, she immediately smiled from ear to ear. She remembered that Draco is now her fiancé. The necklace was a proof of it. She thinks it's better than a ring. Well, he did give her an engagement ring before and look what happened. She would insist on wearing a wedding ring instead.She quickly took a shower and dressed. She is very much excited to go to work today and tell Ginny the news. She would call or email the rest of her friends. She just go t engaged and there's no date yet or flowers, or motif. She felt giddy again like she did before. She knew that this time it is right.Once she was in front of the studio, she can't stop herself from grinning. She opened the door and Elena greeted her. "Morning Hermione." Hermione nodded and headed towards Ginny's office."Hey Hermione, I want you to see the pictures from your birthday bonanza." Ginny waved her to come closer.Hermione waltzed to Ginny's desk and just stood in front of her friend. "Notice anything different?"Ginny was still buried in her computer. "New hair color?""Nope.""New dress?""Nope."Ginny shut her eyes briefly. "Oh God, don't tell me you're preg-"Hermione placed her hands on her waist. "Ginny! If you would just give a damn second to look at me…and I'm not pregnant!"Ginny sighed. "Thank God!" She turned her head to face her. "I don't know what else to say- oh my! That's a gorgeous necklace!"Hermione grinned and traced her fingers on the necklace. "I know, but, there's something else."Ginny's jaw dropped. "Don't tell me that is an engagement thing." Her friend definitely knew her that much.She nodded. "Draco proposed to me last night."Ginny jumped up from her seat. "Merlin! I'm so happy for you Hermione! Does Harry know?"She shook her head. "You're the first."Ginny's eyes filled up with tears. "I-I don't know what to say. I'm just so happy for you."Hermione pulled her into a friendly hug. "Thank you. I will send Harry and the rest an email about the engagement."Ginny nodded. "Wanna see the pictures yesterday?"oOoOoOoHer inbox was booming with mails, text messages and her phone kept ringing the whole day. Molly insisted that she and Draco should have lunch in the Burrow together with Ginny, Harry and Ron. She called Draco about the lunch and he wished he could join but he had to finish closing a deal with another company so he could take a time off his work for the wedding preparations.As usual, Molly had tears in her eyes as she saw the necklace. She gave her the motherly love she's always given to all of them. Harry and Ron were happy about it too. "Just make sure he shows u-" Ginny nudged her brother's rib and glared at him."So, does he know?" Harry began.Hermione faced him and shook her head. "I don't know how to tell him the truth."Ginny sat down on the couch and shrugged. "Just tell him."Hermione scoffed. "I can't do that." She can't. It would ruin everything. She can't even find the right words to make him understand why she did this."Well, I said it was a bad idea in the first place." Harry mumbled. Ron nodded slightly in agreement.She ignored her friends and started to pace in the living room. She stopped and turned to her friends, her face lit up. "I have an idea. I could fake it again.""What?" The three said chorally."Yes." Hermione talked to herself. "I could have a fake accident where I bump my head and then remember everything." She had this look on her face like she has won the lottery.Ginny snorted. "Yeah right. And how are you supposed to do that?""I could hit you in the head with a Bludger Hermione." Ron chortled. Harry couldn't help but laugh."You want me to hit you now?" Hermione glared at Ron. Ginny threw a pillow at her older brother."Hey!" Ron complained."It might bring your senses back." Ginny smiled innocently."I'm not the one who needed my senses back." Ron mumbled.Harry nudged his best friend in the rib and cocked his head to Hermione's direction. She frowned at both of them.She sighed and sat on the couch in front of them. "Okay. So, how do I make a fake accident?" She glanced around the room and snapped her fingers. "I know. I could pretend to slip in the studio then bump my head on the wall."The three shook their heads. "That's too obvious." Harry added."Okay not that. Maybe I could bring Draco in Flourish and Blotts and while I was reading, someone would push the shelf and it would hit my head."Ron knotted his brows. "Why do you want to hurt yourself that much 'Mione? First of all, Draco wouldn't allow you to get hurt. Second of all, he could kill that person who'll push that shelf."Hermione pursed her lips. As much as she hated to admit it, Ron was right. She couldn't pull off some stunts because Draco would save her.Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. "Look, there's just a simple solution to your problem."Ginny took Harry's hand and gave it a little squeeze. "Just tell him the truth."oOoOoOo"I'll tell her the truth." Draco smiled as he helped himself with some scotch. They were celebrating his engagement.Blaise, Marcus and Theo almost splurred out their drinks. They can't believe what they just heard."What? Why?" Blaise asked.Draco shrugged. "To start, we'll get married. I don't want to keep the fact that I'm the guy who left her in the aisle. That's not fair, right? She has to know the truth."Blaise waved his hand in the air. "That's the point! Why tell her you left her in the aisle before?"Draco took a sip on his glass. "Because it's the right thing to do." He said it slowly for his friend to understand. Gods his friends have slow brains.Marcus thought for a moment. "Okay. Point taken. But, what if she'll hate you for that? What if she'll leave you for lying to her?""Wait." Theo raised his hand to stop Marcus. "What if she doesn't get mad and forgive him instead?" He placed his hands on the side as if to say he has a good point.Draco downed his glass. "What I want is a real and honest relationship. I'll accept whatever her decision is after I told her the truth. If she gets angry, I'll give her time to cool down, to think things through. I would do anything again for her to forgive me. But, like what Theo said, if she forgives me as soon as I told her everything, then.." He smirked. "I'll be the happiest man in the world."Blaise placed his hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're really sure this time aren't you?"Draco's smirk grew into a grin. "I love her. This time I won't let her slip away."oOoOoOoHermione checked her bag if all she needed was there. Today is Andrew's event – the one where he would have his photos auctioned for St. Mungos. She called Draco already and told him about the event. He didn't like it at first but finally gave in. He knew well he couldn't stop her from doing something or from seeing someone. She promised him that she'll be home as soon as the event ended.Ginny loaded the final bag they need. She closed the trunk and sat at the passenger's seat. "Let's go."They drove off to a five star hotel where the event was being held in the Grand Ballroom. All the pictures she's seen in the warehouse were there. They started to set up their equipment and once they were settled, the organizer came to greet them."Hello Ms. Granger – Ms. Weasley." He shook their hands."Where's Andrew?" Hermione asked craning her neck around to look for him.The organizer looked around as well, "Oh, there he is. If you'll excuse me." He continued to talk to someone on his wireless earphone.Ginny cocked her head to the side. "Go talk to him."Hermione nodded. She hasn't heard from him since the day he went to her studio. She wasn't even sure if he still hired her for this event but looking around, he didn't hire anybody else.She tapped her shoulder. He turned around and gave a small smile."Hi." She muttered."Hi." He replied in a soft voice."So-" she began. What could they talk about? What should she ask him? Hey, you didn't call. Any problem?The organizer came to his side. "The guests are here."Andrew glanced at the organizer to Hermione. "Excuse me." He told her and darted to the door where the guests are entering."It's time to take pictures Miss Granger." The organizer said. Hermione nodded and went back to where Ginny was standing.Ginny looked at her with a look that means 'What happened?' but she just shook her head and continued to work.The auction was starting. Andrew was raising a lot of Galleons. She smiled at that thought. All of the profits would be for a good cause.She can't find Andrew anywhere though. There are just too much people and the ballroom had dim lights. The only brightest light was the spotlight to the picture being auctioned.There were soft whispers when the next picture was being auctioned. Hermione peered up and saw that it was the picture of her eyes."And the last is the masterpiece of Sir Andrew. He calls it 'True Love'. Let's start the bidding with 50,000 galleons." The man said."80,000 galleons." Said a woman from the corner."We have 80,000 galleons. Do I hear 90,000? The man peered around."90,000 galleons. 90,000 galleons going once…""100,000 galleons." She heard a familiar voice in the front of the line."100,000 galleons from Sir Andrew.""200,000 galleons." She heard yet another familiar voice at the back. She glanced and saw it was Draco."Wow, 200,000 to Sir Draco Malfoy. Anyone wish to go higher?""500,000 galleons." Andrew raised his glass to Draco.There were gasps from other guests.Hermione covered her face with her palm. She could feel her face heat up. Good thing no one could say from the dark room."Okay, we have 500,000 from Sir Andrew. Anyone who wish to go higher?"Draco smirked. "One million galleons."There were another round of gasps and applause from the room."One million galleons from Sir Draco. Wow. I think we have a winner."Andrew shrugged. "It's for a good cause. Five million galleons."Hermione's head perked up. She knew Draco wouldn't let Andrew win. She rushed to the back of the room where Draco is standing."Draco, stop."He glanced at her and smirked. "It's for a good cause love.""Yes, but I know what you're doing. It's just a picture.""Five million going once.." the master of ceremonies said."Love, it's you in the picture.""But-""I want this." Draco placed his hands on her shoulders."Going twice…""It's a picture, Draco. You have me." Hermione whispered.He smiled and kissed her deeply."Going thrice, sold to Sir Andrew." There was a loud applause surrounding the room.Andrew glanced back and saw Draco and Hermione kiss. He smiled sadly and turned away. Some wizards and witches congratulated him. He darted towards the other side of the room when he felt someone grab his arm."Andrew." Hermione said.He looked at his arm then to Hermione then around the room. "Draco's outside. It's okay. I told him I need to speak to you."She let go of him. "I know something's wrong. You just shut me out. Care to tell me what it is?"Andrew sighed. "I already told you everything you need to know. I told you it would take time before I could move on.""I know it was you who gave Draco a cut on his lip." Hermione said bluntly."Sorry about that." He scratched the back of his neck. "He deserves it."Hermione's lips curved a little. "Yeah. I guess you're right. But I know he punched you too."He cocked his head to the side. "He told you that?"Hermione rolled her eyes playfully. "No. I told you, Theo can't keep his mouth shut."Andrew chuckled. "Hey, Hermione- about the picture – ""You bid on your own work." Hermione said."Well, that's the only memory I have of you." He paused. "And, it's for a good cause." He added.She sighed and nodded. "So, are we okay?"Andrew cleared his throat and ran his hand through his hair. "I want to be honest with you. We're okay. You're okay" He pointed at her. "But I'm not okay." He pointed at himself. "But –" He added quickly as he saw a hint of disappointment in her face. "I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. I told you and I'll tell you again…I just need time."Hermione glanced at him. "Andrew-""I'm going to New York."She was out of words from shock."I'll be staying there maybe for a long time." He said softly.She felt tears prickling her eyes. "Wow, that's great. Really. I'm happy for you."He smiled, his soft smile that she would miss. She took her camera and took the last shot of it."I needed a remembrance of you as well. I- I have to pack now. I'll see you –" She trailed off."Someday." He finished her sentence off.She turned around and started to take a few steps away when she felt Andrew grasp her arm. He pulled her into his arms and he held her tightly but gently. After a few seconds, he pulled away and left not glancing back. Hermione sighed and turned away. She has to pack her things and Draco was waiting for her.Andrew was on his way to another door when Ginny called him. "Hey."Andrew stopped and turned to face her. "Hey Gin.""Will you come tomorrow to the studio to check the pictures? You might want to edit some – ""I'll let my assistant do that. I'll be going to New York tomorrow." He cut her off.Ginny pursed her lips. "I know you're leaving because it's easier to walk away that to fight for what you really want."Andrew half smiled. "It's hard to fight for something when you know from the beginning you've already lost."You'll find your happiness one day." She said.She raised her brow and waited for him to spill things out. She knew he was still hiding something.Andrew gave up. "I love her. You know that. Everyone knows that. But she doesn't love me. She loves him. She'll always love him. I could fight for her all years of my life but I know I'll never win. Someday he'll ask her to marry him and she'll say yes. And before that happens, I want to be far away cause it will hurt so damn much."Ginny looked down and then back up at him. She gave him a sad smile.He gasped. He looked lost for a second and then forced a smile. "I see. See you soon Gin. Congratulate them for me." And he turned on his heel and left. That's the last time they ever saw Andrew.A/N: So I found this and just finished it today. I'm sorry for the VERY LATE UPDATE. I had thesis, now I have an internship. Crazy and busy life but I managed to write a few chapters on my new fic. I made a trailer for it but the internet connection is taking too much time and I don't know if I'll be able to upload it. I'll try to focus on this fic first and try to change it a little bit. I think I'm yapping a lot now and I hope this note still makes sense. So how are you guys? 2013 doing great? If there are errors, you guys know me. Beta anyone?

A/N: Hi everyone. This is another update. Thank you for adding this fic to your favorites and for following too. The reviews made me smile. REALLY SMILE! I had to stop smiling as I read the email from fanfic about the reviews from my phone while I was at work for my internship. Don't want people to think I'm taking work lightly. HAHA! There's one comment that says that this fic is from a Filipino Movie. I know it is. I think I've mentioned it earlier (Chapter 1). I'm working on my next fic which made it kinda confusing whenever I continue writing this. Anyway, on to the story. Oh, by the way, I placed some music I was listening to. Just wanted to share.Chapter 18I'll find a way – (Forgot the artist, sorry)This is the day. This is the day she would tell him the truth. Hermione had a plan. It's a stupid plan actually but she never really "planned" it. It was only the best she got so far due to the fact that she's inside the car with Draco. This has to bloody work. She's been dreading all night after Andrew's event because she can't come up with anything to tell a truth…and to top it all off…this truth could ruin everything. She traced the necklace that Draco gave her. She looked down on it sadly. Well, maybe after telling the truth she might not be able to wear it anymore. She glanced at Draco whose eyes were fixed on the road. Just looking at her fiancé makes her heart skip a beat. He glanced at her quickly and smiled.Ginny told her that Andrew congratulates them upon their engagement. She literally smacked her head for forgetting to mention about it to him. She was planning to tell him though but he distracted her by announcing the news that he's leaving. Now that she thought about Andrew, she is more determined to tell Draco the truth. Andrew knew the whole truth. Isn't it Draco's right to know the truth too?They were still on the road, driving somewhere. She took another glance at Draco and noticed he looked nervous too.He peeked to his side to check on her. This would be the day he'll tell her the truth. He'll tell her the cold harsh truth that he was the douche who left her in the aisle. He had a plan. He hoped that this plan would work. It should work. He had arranged everything and they're on their way. He hoped above hope that the truth wouldn't shock her that she would run away and leave him…forever.There was an awkward silence surrounding them. Before, they could drive without talking but it was a comfortable silence. Now, it's different.He has to loosen the tension a bit. "Do you want music?" He didn't wait for her to answer and turned the radio on.She placed her hand on top of his. "Your hands are cold."Draco swallowed. He's so nervous that his hands and feet are freezing. "Uh – I think your hands are cold too."Hermione bit her lip. She's so nervous. "It must be the air condition." She forced a smile.He took a quick glance at her. "Are you alright? Are you feeling ill?"This is it. I should do it while Draco is looking at me. "Draco a cat!" She shrieked.Draco was too shocked and he hit on the breaks. Hermione choked as she felt herself being held tightly. She was planning to hit her head on the dash board as soon as he hit on the breaks then pretend that the impact would trigger her memory. See? It was obviously the most stupid plan she had made in all her years of existence. It was all she could come up with. She can't wait any longer because this surprise of his might be something that could make it even more difficult to tell the truth. She scowled at the seatbelt who made this plan fail."Are you okay?" Draco placed his hand on her head, shoulder and arm. He looked so scared. She felt guilty for putting him up in this state.She smiled weakly. "Yes, I'm okay. I just thought I saw a cat. I'm sorry."Draco sighed in relief. "It's okay." He started to drive again.She slightly loosened her seatbelt as they turned right. She started to glance around the road again about to wait for the right moment to pull that stunt one more time. She had to hit her head before they reach their destination.You Got Me – Colbie Caillat"We're here." He announced as he parked the car.She frowned. How about her bloody plan? She looked around and saw that they were in a familiar restaurant.He opened the door for her but before he led her inside, he took something out from his pocket. It was a small white envelope. She looked up at him and saw a hint of blush in his cheeks. He motioned her to open it and she did. She gasped as she saw what it was."Your picture?" She looked confused. She took it before."Yes. You took it. I told you I was giving it to a special girl. My girlfriend, remember?" He grinned. "Well, now she's mine. And what makes it better is that she's not my girlfriend but my fiancé."She giggled, kissed his picture and placed his picture in her bag. She kissed him softly on his lips. "So, this is your plan? We drove all the way here just to give me your picture?"He shook his head and grinned. "No. There's more." He led her inside the restaurant. She saw a medium sized banner that says: Speed Dating Event.Is he seriously taking me on a speed dating event? Why?She scanned the room. The setup was familiar and she spotted Blaise, Marcus, Crabbe and Goyle on the corner waving at her. There was Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot. There were also men and women in the room.Forever ain't enough – J. Holiday"What is this?" Hermione was really confused.He turned to face her. "Remember when I told you that if I was given a chance to go back to the past, I would go back to the time I saw and fell in love with you?" He paused and waved his hand to motion their surroundings. "This is how our love story started."This is how he planned it. He would start from the beginning up to the wedding, everything that happened before she got amnesia. He could feel his heart beat speed up. He hoped for the best and prays she would forgive him. He placed the ribbon on his wrist.He took her hand in the middle of the restaurant. "You were standing here." He placed her on the spot where he first saw her. "I was staying there." He pointed where his friends were."I saw you, but your back was facing me. We were all in awe of you even if we can't see your face. I said 'That's my date.' But you glanced to the side and we saw that you were given the 'Event Organizer' name tag." As he said this the same old woman gave her the name tag.He continued as she glanced at him, still in shock and in awe. "They said it was such a waste. But I don't care. I said that name tag -" He pointed at the small paper on her shirt. "- Won't stop me from meeting you.""The event started –" He led her to the bar while the rest rushed to their places and took a seat on the chairs. "- then you went to the bar." Hermione could feel tears in her eyes and felt a lump on her throat. So his plan was to tell her the truth and he planned on telling her from the beginning. He remembered that day like it just happened yesterday. "You were seating here then I tapped your shoulder." He smiled. He tapped her shoulder then she turned to faced him. "We were both surprised to see each other." A blush formed on his cheeks as he smiled sheepishly. "I found you very beautiful and hot."She sighed and smiled, blinking tears away. He took it as a good sign to continue since she isn't slapping him yet. "You said 'Nice to see you here Malfoy. Aren't you supposed to be there?'" Then he waved his hand "But I said, 'Of course not' but you took my hand and said that I was one of the participants. The usual, I replied, that this was actually a mistake. And that my good friend Theo set me up here. I asked you if you were a participant but you pointed at your name tag and said you were the event organizer.""You asked me why I wasn't there and not over there." He smiled. "I said I would like to know if you believe in love at first sight. But you said no." He disappeared then popped behind her. "Then I said 'How about second sight?"She smiled through tears. She really doesn't know what to say. She assumed he forgot how they met but she was proved wrong. How can she tell him the truth now when he's very happy to tell her how they met?Excitement lit on his eyes. "You even asked me where I was last night. I admit I was taken aback with your question. I even said I was in my office. Then you said 'So that's why you weren't in my dreams last night.'" He laughed softly at the memory. "I remembered that you were thinking about something then blushed. Then I said –""You said 'You know, you might not be able to come home tonight.'" She interrupted him through tears. She swallowed and continued. "Then I asked why not then you said 'Because you're already in my mind.'" She has to tell him now. She can't take it anymore. She has to tell him the truth now.Forgetting – David GrayHis smile began to fade as soon as she interrupted him. He felt like the whole world stopped. This is it. She remembered. He was nervously waiting what she would do next and braced himself for a slap, a hex or anything - but at the bottom of his list the thing she could do to him after knowing, hell even remembering everything, he hoped she would forgive him."Y-you remember now?" He could feel his heart beat fast; his hands and feet are cold.She swallowed again, forcing the lump on her throat to be gone and letting tears fall down from her face. "I've never forgotten this day, Draco. I could never forget this. I didn't have an accident. There is no amnesia. I lied to you Draco." She tried to find some air. "I was afraid. I was even more afraid to lose you which is why I can't tell you the truth. Not a day has gone by that I wish I could tell you this but I'm afraid what you'll say back." She paused. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."Once the truth was out, Draco froze. He felt like he was splashed with a bucket of cold water. He nodded. That's all he could ever do. He felt like the world crashed to pieces. He found it hard to speak as his mind was still trying to process everything. He can't talk to her now. He was really confused and hurt so all he could do is turn his heel and leave.She cried harder as she dug her face in her hands. She can't move her feet to follow him. She can't face him right now. She's not in a proper disposition to talk to him and she knew he wasn't either. The Slytherin boys didn't know what happened but as soon as Draco was walking away, they rushed to where Hermione was. Marcus and Theo, who appeared from nowhere, stood behind her and placed their hand on her shoulder while Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle followed Draco.This is why she doesn't want to tell him the truth. Telling the truth could really hurt someone. It could ruin everything that was once perfect. If being honest is good, then why do people get hurt after knowing the truth? She blames herself. It's her fault that she is in this situation right now.oOoOoOoNothing – The ScriptDraco apparated back to his flat. He heard another pop. All his friends followed him home. He flopped down on the couch and rubbed his face with his palm. The silence stretched further. Finally, he found his voice to speak. "I didn't see that coming."Blaise, who was standing by the fireplace, sat next to him – Theo on the other side. Marcus leaned by the window while Crabbe and Goyle sat across them.He let out a loud sigh. "I was expecting a slap, a punch on the face, a hex, name it – but – not this." He shook his head slightly. "It hurts. Fuck. It hurts so much." He paused. "I honestly didn't know what I did wrong this time."Marcus shook his head. "I can't believe we fell for that. We're too old to believe she had amnesia."Draco groaned in frustration. He felt warm tears fall down his cheeks. He found it hard to control them any longer. He doesn't care if his friends saw this. Hewas feeling so much pain, not even a Crucio could compete with what he's feeling right now.Blaise gave a pat on his back. "Come on man, don't cry. Are you a pussy?""Let him cry." Theo glanced at Blaise. "He's hurt. He has to let it all out. Once he let it all out he'll have a clear mind to answer some questions."Blaise raised an eyebrow. "And what are those questions?"Theo shrugged. "Why did he take Hermione back and why would he let her go again?"oOoOoOoWhen a Heart Breaks – Ben RectorHermione was lying down on her bed. Pain. She was in too much pain. She remembered how Draco looked at her as she blurted out the truth. He looked really crushed and lost which made it worse.She let tears flow in her eyes, feeling them crawl down her cheeks. It was her fault this time. She knew it. She doesn't even want to acknowledge the fact that he deserved it for leaving her before. All she wanted was him, and this was so fucked up already she can't even pinpoint which went wrong first. She shouldn't have lied to him at the first place. She was so mad at him when she first saw him again that she said something stupid like 'amnesia'. At the first place, she shouldn't have cared about him at Flourish and Blotts if she was over him. But the truth is… she was mad because she still cared about him. She wanted to know why he left her. She did get his answer to her question then – then everything became clearer. Her heart was healed, but then – this happened.She was in deep thought that she barely acknowledged her best friend who slowly sat at the edge of her bed."You want some tea?" Ginny gently massaged her arm.She shook her head. She knew her best friends heard about what happened earlier. She knew Harry and Ron were standing by the door although her back was facing them. And she knew that they don't know what to say so they let Ginny do the talking."I know you don't want to talk about it know." Ginny said in a soft voice. "Just rest your heart for a while."Without You – Ben RectorGinny slowly stood and went to the door. Hermione was still in deep thought. Now she's learned a valuable lesson. Never lie to the person you love. It's not worth it and they don't deserve it. She should've known better. Draco didn't deserve anything. She tried her revenge and where did it lead her to? She placed herself in this situation. She should accept the consequence for lying.Ginny closed the door gently and led Harry and Ron to the living room.Ron plonked down the couch next to Harry who was sitting beside Ginny. "I just don't get why Hermione even wanted to get back with Malfoy at the first place." Ron muttered."Yeah." Harry agreed. "There are many other blokes she could be with. Like –" he thought for a moment."Andrew." Ron helped his friend.Harry nodded. "Yeah, like Andrew."Ginny turned to face both of them. "You guys just don't get it. Every girl has that one guy she goes back to. Heartbreak after heartbreak and nobody knows why, not even her. And she just can't let go. She loves Draco so much even after what he did to her. They love she had for him always remained. As much as both of you hate to admit it… you know this already."Harry and Ron fell silent. They never understood women but Ginny was right. Somehow they knew Hermione still loved Draco even though he did leave her in the aisle. They knew Hermione too much that she could be stubborn and could have too much pride in her to pretend that she'd forgotten about Draco for nearly three years. But still – they hated to see her go through so much pain again.A/N: If you're confused to what Draco was referring to, please check Chapter 1, 2, 9 and 16. Thank you. Review please. I've re-read this chapter again…kinda. But give me some credit for trying to read it again, even though it was a little re-reading. Haha! Thanks!

A/N: Again, it's been a while and I have received emails that made me inspired to write again and also there were new readers who made My Amnesia Girl their favorite. Thank you to everyone.Chapter 19It has been five days since the truth came out and Hermione was trying to move on, sort of, with her life by getting back to work. The studio is somewhat her sweet escape to the cold harsh truth that she and Draco could possibly be over, and this time…forever. But it seems that her safe haven was even worse than her cozy flat. Being in the studio only brought back memories of Draco, and right at this very moment, she was staring blankly at her laptop. She took a glimpse at her phone and still no new messages, not even a phone call from Draco. She tried to call him – several times – but stopped herself before pressing the green button. Really? What could she say? She's stuck between taking the blame and pointing the finger at him.Hermione's behavior was too obvious for Ginny. Ginny was concerned for her friend. She would see Hermione jump slightly every time the bell by the door rings and rush out her office to check who it was and how her face falls when it wasn't Draco.Ginny leaned on her desk. "Are you okay?Hermione looked up at her and gave a small smile. "Yup."oOoOoOoHermione checked her email, and still no sign of Draco. It is day seven without him. She reached her phone but placed it down again but then her phone rang. She grabbed her phone again and pressed a button. "Draco?" Ginny's head shot up and she glanced to face her friend. Hermione's face fell. "Oh, Ron…Why did you call? No, no, I just thought it was someone…Yes, I'm okay… Ginny's here… Yeah… I have plans tonight…Umm…A lot of work to do… Okay… Bye." She pressed the 'end' button and placed her phone down her desk. Ginny gave her friend a small smile while Hermione forced one out. "Ron said your mum wants you at the Burrow at six." Ginny cocked her head to the side. "You're not coming?"Hermione just went back to work. She knew Ginny understood why she doesn't want to go to the Burrow. Another mother talk with Molly isn't really what she needed right now. They had the talk before during 'the-supposed-wedding-but-didn't-happen' and she doesn't want to have that again.oOoOoOoDay ten and still no Draco. She heard the bell ring and shot her head up. Ginny glanced at her and smiled sadly "It was just the customers…they just left."Hermione continued her work. This really is starting to annoy her. She closed her eyes shut and slammed her desk. "I can't bloody take this anymore." She stood up and took her bag. She has to go to him. She loves him and she has to do something. If he won't do anything then she would. She finally accepted the blame. This time, it's her who screwed things up.She made a beeline to the door when Ginny blocked her way. "Where are you going?""I'm going to Draco and apologize." She took a step to the right and walked past her. Ginny trailed behind. "What if he doesn't talk to you?"Hermione swallowed. "I'll make him talk to me.""What if he doesn't listen to you?""I don't care.""What if he doesn't forgive you?"Hermione turned to face her friend, her eyes full of unshed tears. "I don't care. I just want to say how sorry I am, I just want to talk to him - I just want to tell him that I love him very much." She turned her heel again and left. Ginny smiled as she watches her friend walk out of the studio.oOoOoOoOo"According to the census, there are 9 million people in London. How will you know if you've found the one for you? Maybe you've seen her already, but you bent down to tie your shoelace. Maybe she was already beside you but you looked to another direction to see the traffic lights. Maybe you've already crossed each other's paths but the cab blocked your way. There are some people who were lucky to find the one for them. There are some, who's still searching and some have given up. But the worst part is, it's yours already but you let it slip away." Draco said in a cold voice staring blankly at a young woman who apparently was his new employee.Today is the usual day Draco would give a demo to his employees on how to make a sale to their clients. He always shows them his charisma, his smirk and how he uses his favorite speech about grabbing the opportunity. But this time, it's different. It seems like life was pulled out of him. He kept thinking about Hermione, the moment he saw her at Flourish and Blotts down to her fake amnesia confession. He's confused and hurt at the same time…angry even – he's not sure. One thing he was sure about was that he felt numb. Blaise and his friends visited him often to make sure he won't do anything stupid but they sure were willing to join him for a bottle of whisky."But, Sir, how did you know she's your true love…the one for you, when you let her slip away?" The woman said which pulled him out of his reverie.He glanced up at her. "Huh?"The woman shrugged. "Did you try another girl?"He looked lost for a moment. "What was that?"The woman continued ignoring his question. "Or are you saying that she's your true love for sentimental reasons because she'll never come back?"He thought for a moment then looked up at her. "No, she came back. I came back to her. We had a second chance…" His eyes grew wide at the sudden realization. "I had a second chance… and I love her even more.The woman smiled. "Sir, you're so lucky."He stood up, excused himself and rushed out of his building. What was he thinking? He loves her, always have and always will. He can't just let her slip away again because she lied to him. He lied to her as well and even hurt her before when he left. He realized that she must've been scared, just like him, when they saw each other at Flourish and Blotts and that it could be the main reason why she lied. But if she didn't do that, he wouldn't be able to start all over, to start their relationship over. He wouldn't be able to tell her the truth why he left and even realize his true feelings for her.Fate, destiny or whatever anyone calls it gave them another chance. This time he won't let her slip away. This time he'll make everything right and he has to do something now or he'll never get another chance again.He took his car keys and started the engine.oOoOoOoHermione closed the door to her studio when her phone rang. "Draco?""Hermione." His voice has a sign of relief and longing. "Where are you?"Her voice started to crack. "I'm on my way to your office."Draco smiled as tears started to fill his eyes. "You're coming to see me?"She smiled through her phone, holding it so tight like her life depended on it. "Of course I am. Why do you think people go to see someone?""Because you like that person?"Hermione allowed her tears to roll down her cheeks. "No. It's because you love that person." She paused. "I'm sorry Draco. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."Draco paused and cleared his throat trying to stop his tears from falling. "Shh. It's okay."There was a short pause between them."I love you." They said in unison. They laughed."I love you too." They both said it again at the same time.Draco smiled as he stepped on the gas, his hand on his phone while the other was steering the wheel. "Don't go anywhere. I'll be the one to go to you. Stay there. Don't leave."Hermione nodded but then realized she was on the phone so he couldn't see her response. "Yes, Draco. I'll stay here. I'll wait for you."He stepped on the gas once more. He wanted to see her as soon as possible. He missed her. "I love you so much Hermione. Don't forget that. We'll start over again. I'll see you in a while." He pressed the end button and smiled at his phone and placed it down beside him. He'll finally see her. He'll finally feel her lips, see her smile and pull her into his arms where she belongs.He was driving as fast as he could but trying to be safe and to stay out of trouble. He was approaching an intersection and thanked Merlin that the once red light turned green. He drove straight when another car on the left side beat the red light and crashed directly to him.oOoOoOoA/N: Review please and thank you. They inspire me a lot.

A/N: As soon as I posted Chapter 19, I knew I needed to write the next one. I am not quite sure if this is the last chapter because I feel there is something more to write about. In the movie, this is how it ends. But I don't know how will I change or twist the ending. I've written numerous versions for this chapter and really had a difficult time processing things on how I wanted this to end until I've finally made a decision. Heck, it was really stressful. The semester has started and I still have to finish my internship. So yeah, I'm really stressed out. I'm amazed how some of you had predicted what will happen. Let's see. Thank you for the reviews and please don't forget to leave another review after reading this one. Chapter 20Hermione checked her watch. It usually takes an hour and a half to reach her studio when Draco drives his way there from his office. She isn't worried that much because he's late for only twenty minutes but something keeps telling her that there is something wrong. Her hands and feet started to feel cold and her heart was beating fast.Maybe he bought flowers or something. Maybe he's stuck in traffic. She thought. She sat down on the stairs just outside the studio and held on to her phone just in case he calls. She was about to call him but stopped herself again because she knew he was driving and didn't want to put his life in danger.She glanced up and craned her neck to see if Draco's car is coming. She stood up and went down the steps to wait by the pavement. The streetlights were starting to light up as the sky grows darker.Thirty minutes late. The stars are now blanketing the night sky and the moon was shining behind a small cloud. Where could he be? She felt like crying, feeling her heart on her throat. There's definitely something wrong. Where are you Draco?oOoOoOoOne of the many things Draco hates is making one small mistake. Of all days, he chose this day to forget to put his seat belt on. Who forgets that one most important rule? I do. Draco thought bitterly as he tried to struggle from his position.Draco felt pain all over his body but the pain is much stronger in his head. He knew he bumped his head hard from the strong impact. He found it difficult to move and felt something dripping from his body and face. He willed his eyes open and realized that his car was tipped over. His shirt was covered in blood. Broken glasses covered his body; one was stuck on his rib and another on his left shoulder. He felt his limbs were stuck and his right ankle is twisted.He could barely breathe. Every breath felt like the glass was cutting deeper to his rib cage. His eyelids began to feel heavy. He forced his eyes to stay open and tried to get out of the car but he just can't. He could see some people coming over but their voices were barely audible.A man, who looked like in his fifties, bent down and looked at him in horror. "Jesus. Sir…Sir… stay with me." The man glanced up to face a woman who seems like in her forties. "Linda, call 999 and check the other driver in that car." He pointed to the other car. The woman nodded and grabbed her phone quickly. The man looked down once again at Draco. "Sir, my name is Ben. Open your eyes. Stay with me. Just listen to my voice."Draco tried to speak but he only tasted blood every time he moved his lips. "Her…Her…"The man knotted his brows.Hermione! Draco tried to yell her name out. He thought of her and only her and closed his eyes briefly picturing her face, her smile. He has to be okay. He has to get out of here."Don't close your eyes Sir. Help is coming." The man's voice grew louder, panic etched in his voice. "Just open your eyes and stay with me."Draco forced his eyes open and used all the energy left on his body to grab his phone in the far corner. He groaned as he felt more pain like he's been sent the Crucio a million times."Sir, please don't move."Draco didn't listen, he has to get his phone. Hermione. I need to hear her voice… just her voice. I need to let her know I'm still coming. I'll be okay. This is nothing. He felt tears prickling his eyes. Damn it! Why is this so fucking difficult? Hermione!The man placed his hand gently on Draco's arm "Please don't move." He bent further to see what Draco was trying to reach. "I'll get that for you sir. Just please, stop moving." The man rushed to the other side of the car and took the phone. He came back and bent down again to show Draco he has the phone.Draco may not know Ben but he was relieved that his phone is in the old man's grasp. He tried to talk once more. "Herm…" His mind was screaming her name over and over again but he can't will his mouth to cooperate. The man opened his phone. "Sir, I'll just call every person in your phone book. Just stay with me okay?"Fuck! Just call Hermione now. He gritted his teeth as he tried to control the pain he felt. I have to be okay. I have to stay alive. Hermione…she's waiting for me…again.The woman, Linda, came and told Ben that the ambulance and police are on their way. The other driver only suffered minor wounds and scratches. He must have put his seat belt on. Draco heard from their conversation that the man was drunk. Drunk but still had the decency to put his seat belt on.Their voices started to fade and Draco felt like he's being pulled deeper in the ocean. His breathe became shorter and his eyes are really giving up on him. He's tired. He closed his eyes slowly and thought of Hermione. Draco. He imagined her voice. I love you, Draco.The man noticed Draco and called out on him. They could hear the siren of the ambulance also of the police. He asked the woman to watch over Draco while he checked the cell phone to see who the last person he called was. It says 'Hermione', he pressed the green button.oOoOoOoShe started to pace back and forth. She stopped when her phone began to ring. The small screen said it was Draco. She sighed in relief and pressed the green button."Draco, thank God you called. I was starting to worry. Where are you?"She heard different voices on the other line. "Uhm, sorry, this isn't Draco. Draco isn't it? This is Ben… Draco got into an accident. He's now sent at the Cromwell Hospital. The police brought the lunatic driver to the station already. I had to call you because you were the last person he called. I will call the rest of his contacts and inform them about Draco. Hello? Are you still there?"Hermione's heart stopped the moment 'Ben' said Draco got into an accident. Her head was spinning and she felt a huge lump on her throat. "I-I'll be there."oOoOoOoShe rushed to the emergency room and saw Blaise, Pansy and Theo there. "Where's Draco?" She asked and glanced around. She could feel her whole body shaking it was a miracle she was able to ask them where he was.Theo placed his hands on her shoulders. "He's in the operating room. They'll send him to his room after. We should wait here."She shook her head. "No, I – I want to see him now. He needs me. I need him." She broke down in tears.Why did this happen? Why should it be Draco? If only she went to him sooner.Theo pulled her closer. "Don't blame yourself Hermione. This didn't happen because of you. We made sure that drunk driver would rot in jail for the rest of his life together with those hexes we sent him."Blaise finished filling out some papers and stood beside her and Theo. Pansy was talking to someone on the phone."Pansy called Lucius and Narcissa, they are on their way." Blaise muttered. "I've called Marcus as well. He's on his way."Theo led Hermione to the waiting area. "Let's wait here. Do you want coffee?" She shook her head.Pansy sat down beside her. "Everything will be okay." She placed her hand on Hermione's giving it a little squeeze.Hermione doesn't know what to say. She's too scared, to shocked and she's too angry at herself. She wiped her tears with her hands. Pansy is right. Everything would be okay. Draco has gone through a lot of things and she knew he could surpass this one.oOoOoOoIt was dark, very dark. Draco tried to reach out but he felt nothing. He walked deeper into the darkness until he found a small picture. He saw a picture of a boy and a girl. He found it difficult to see their faces clearly because of the darkness. He took a closer look and the picture suddenly disappeared.oOoOoOoThey've been waiting for three hours. Blaise brought Pansy home for their baby. Theo was sitting on the chair across her. Lucius and Narcissa were there with them, Narcissa sat beside her. "I'm scared." Narcissa placed her right hand on Hermione's hand and gave it a little squeeze while the other wiped the tears falling down her face. Hermione wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. "I'm scared too. But I know he will be okay. He's a very strong, brave man."Marcus and Blaise came and joined them in the waiting room. It's been six hours and still no results.oOoOoOoAfter eight long hours the doctor came out of the operating room. Everyone stood up and waited for what the doctor has to say. Hermione couldn't move. She's too afraid to speak. She felt a lump on her throat. The doctor looked very tired."Is Draco okay?" Lucius said in a voice they never thought would come out from the old man's mouth. He was worried.The doctor who still has his surgical robes and cap on, which failed to hide his gray hair, glanced at Lucius and to the rest of the crowd in the room. "Are you a relative of Mr. Draco?"Lucius looked annoyed for a moment but Narcissa took his hand and answered for him. "We are Draco's parents.""Very well, we should discuss this privately if you please."Narcissa shook her head. "Please, you can say it to everyone here. She's Draco's fiancée." She gestured at Hermione. "And these men are his best friends. Draco is like a brother to them." She glanced at Marcus, Blaise and Theo then back at the doctor.The doctor sighed. "I'm Dr. Grant. The operation was successful…" Everyone sighed in relief, Narcissa burst into tears. Hermione felt her legs turn to jelly as relief ran through her veins."But – " the doctor added. "His brain was traumatized from the huge impact. He also fractured his ribs, his right arm as well as his leg. We also gave him some stitches in his wounds. But right now, he is okay. He needs a lot of rest and we have to wait until his full recovery. We need a blood donor as well. Does anyone here have the same blood type as Draco?"Lucius stepped forward. "I do."Dr. Grant nodded and waved his hand. "This way Sir, please follow me."Narcissa placed her hand on his arm. "I'll come with you." She glanced at Dr. Grant. "Will Draco be moved to his room?" The doctor nodded. "We just needed this blood transfusion and he'll be brought to his own room. The rest of you could wait over there."Blaise, Marcus and Theo nodded and led Hermione to Draco's private room."Cissy." Lucius pulled his wife in his arms. He didn't say anything more."Our son is okay." She whispered.oOoOoOoOoAs soon as they reached Draco's room, Blaise fished his phone out in his pocket and called Pansy to inform her that Draco is okay. Theo took a seat on one of the sofa while Marcus sat beside him. Hermione rubbed her face with her palm. Ginny called her few minutes ago and so did Harry and Ron. They heard what happened and that they would drop by one of these days. She really needed someone to lean on, someone to talk to, to run to but she didn't want her friends. At times like this, she needed Draco, just Draco. He knew how to comfort her, how to take the pain away. It sucks that the only person she needed isn't here right now.She exhaled slowly and traced her necklace with her fingers. She remembered the moment Dr. Grant announced that Draco is okay. She finally was able to breathe. She didn't know she was holding her breath. It's like the weight was lifted off her shoulders. Draco is okay. My Draco is okay. Everything will be okay from now on.She remembered the last thing Draco told her during their conversation over the phone. "I love you so much Hermione. Don't forget that. We'll start over again. I'll see you in a while." She couldn't stop the tears forming in her eyes again. What if Draco didn't make it? What if he died? That would be the last time she would ever hear his voice. The last time he told her he loved her. She shuddered at that thought. "We'll start over again." She pulled her necklace up to her lips and kissed it. "Yes, we'll start over again." She whispered.oOoOoOoOoDraco could hear voices but it seemed like he was inside a bottle and couldn't recognized who's voice was it. He tried to open his eyes but he can't.Bugger!oOoOoOoOoDraco looked pale. He looked tired. She hasn't seen him for ten days and he still looks the same. He's still the same handsome young man she knew despite of the bruises which tainted his pale skin and a cut in his lip. His head was covered in bandages as well as his chest, arm and leg. He was also wearing a neck brace. She let a tear fall down from her face. "I'm here, Draco. I'll never leave you. I'll stay beside you." Hermione whispered and planted a soft kiss on his hand.oOoOoOoOoDay twoHermione still hasn't eaten anything since yesterday. She just wanted to wait for Draco to wake up. She barely slept either. Lucius and Narcissa went home to change their clothes and get some rest especially Lucius after donating blood for his son. Blaise went home to Pansy. Marcus went home to get some fresh clothes for him and for Theo because Theo stayed in the hospital and brought Hermione some food. Hermione just shook her head and placed her hand on top of Draco's.oOoOoOoOoDay threeNarcissa and Lucius came back with flowers and brought along the best Healer in the Wizarding World. The Healer instantly recognized Hermione and asked her help to enchant some spell to repair the broken bones and heal the wounds. The healer also had inserted a potion inside the IV of Draco to fasten his recovery.oOoOoOoOoDay fiveDr. Grant frowned and checked Draco once more. He was surprised at how fast Draco's wounds healed as well as his bones. He said that it usually takes weeks or months before those fractured bones heal and return to its original state and the wounds were too deep to appear like nothing happened in just five days. "Draco must be a very lucky man. It's a miracle to have such fast recovery in just few days." The doctor added.Theo snorted and was suddenly followed by a double smack in the head by Marcus and Blaise.Theo rubbed his head. "What? It is a miracle."oOoOoOoOoDay sixDraco's bandages were smaller now and Hermione could see his face better. There are still bruises on his face and body and he still had to wear the neck brace as per doctor's orders.Hermione started to read him some poems. Ginny brought her some fresh clothes while Harry brought some breakfast. "You need to eat. Draco would be very angry if he sees you as thin as a wand." Harry narrowed his eyes and waited her to take a bite. She did as she was told. She wasn't aware how hungry she was. Ron transfigured the sofa into a comfortable single bed. Hermione raised her brow."What?" Ron looked embarrassed. "It's the only transfiguration I could perform perfectly."oOoOoOoOoDay eight"I've never seen my son smile until he met you." Narcissa said in a soft voice. "He really is inlove with you."Hermione gave a small smile. "I love him, Narcissa. I hope he wakes up soon. I want to tell him how much I love him and that I couldn't live without him." She felt her tears roll down her cheeks. "Why won't he wake up?" She choked. "This is entirely my fault."Narcissa pulled Hermione in her arms and hugged her tightly. "No darling. It is not your fault. Don't you ever blame yourself."oOoOoOoOoDay elevenTheo, Marcus and Blaise sat quietly by the corner. Theo was eating some grapes while Marcus and Blaise played wizarding chess. Hermione took Draco's hand and kissed it gently. "Draco. Please wake up. Please…I love you."Hermione was about to reach the book on the bedside table when she felt Draco's hand move. She gasped and leaned closer. "Draco?""Draco?" Hermione whispered.Nothing happened.oOoOoOoOoDay twelveLucius was still quiet and looking pensive as he stared outside the window. Narcissa was reading a book. Theo was playing wizard chess with Marcus while Blaise was talking to Pansy on the phone.Hermione was reading a poem to Draco, her hand on top of his.She felt his hand move again. She stood up and leaned her face closer to his. "Draco?"His hand moved once again and his eyes started to move but it was still closed."Draco?" Her voice was louder this time which caught the attention of the people inside the room."Someone call the doctor please." Hermione muttered, never leaving her sight out of Draco. Marcus rushed out of the room.Draco opened his eyes slowly and blinked a few times. Hermione started to feel tears of joy.He's finally awake.Draco glanced around carefully, his head was throbbing. He saw Lucius and Narcissa "Father…Mother." He whispered.Narcissa sobbed and Lucius' eyes were glossy.Draco peered his eye to where Blaise and Marcus were standing. "Blaise, Theo." He forced a smile."Hey mate." Blaise smiled"Glad to have you back." Theo smirked.His eyes landed on Hermione.She hugged him slowly, carefully. His bones were fully repaired and his wounds were healed but she was afraid that she could hurt him. "I've missed you Draco."Draco raised his hands slowly and took her arm, pushing her slightly but still kept her in his grasp. She gazed into his gray eyes through her unshed tears. Gray eyes to hazel. It seemed like the whole world stopped once again and it was just the two of them in the room. She loves this man. She loves him so much and she's very happy that he's finally awake. She's happy that he is holding her once again.He looked lost for a moment and tried to utter some words. His throat felt dry when he swallowed. He felt his mouth move but didn't hear his voice. His brows furrowed as if he was in deep thought. He opened his mouth once again, his voice was too soft."What was that?" Hermione placed her hand on his face."Who are you?" Draco whispered.Hermione sighed. "I already used that line, Draco. Don't you have any originality?" She gave him a warm smile.He pushed her away some more and this time he let her go. Hermione felt like someone splashed her a cold bucket of water."Who are you?" Draco asked again. This time his voice was a bit louder."You don't remember who I am?" Hermione whispered. She looked at him in horror taking a few steps back. What is happening?Draco blinked, frowned, then blinked. He glanced at Hermione. "I don't know you."A/N: Congratulations for those who predicted (correctly) what was bound to happen. This is what I really planned. This is what really happened in the movie but still, I changed it a bit. So…what will happen next? Review everyone!

A/N: Thanks for the reviews and also for adding my fic to your favorite list and for following. Please continue to review. It really inspires me a lot. Oh btw, I made the year, 2002 so it would fit their age since Hermione here is 23 and she's born in 1979 so there. As you go on with the story you'll get it.Chapter 21Previously on My Amnesia Girl…"What was that?" Hermione placed her hand on his face."Who are you?" Draco whispered.Hermione sighed. "I already used that line, Draco. Don't you have any originality?" She gave him a warm smile.He pushed her away some more and this time he let her go. Hermione felt like someone splashed her a cold bucket of water."Who are you?" Draco asked again. This time his voice was a bit louder."You don't remember who I am?" Hermione whispered. She looked at him in horror taking a few steps back. What is happening?Draco blinked, frowned, then blinked. He glanced at Hermione. "I don't know you."oOoOoOoWhat is going on? Hermione was finding it difficult to breathe. The room seemed to grow smaller and smaller. Her head started to spin and a huge lump began to form in her throat. She placed her hand on her chest and held her necklace tightly while taking a few steps back away from Draco. She looked lost and felt like she's in a terrible dream. Draco just watched her with his cold grey eyes."Draco, you don't know Hermione?" Theo asked incredulously."No." Draco's voice was cold. Lucius walked out of the room while Narcissa gasped."Seriously, Drake, she's Hermione – your fiancée – And you love her." Blaise looked annoyed, eyeing Draco if he would finally give up on his joke.Draco just stared at him then took a quick glance at Hermione then back at Blaise. "I don't know her Blaise. And what the hell did you say about her being my fia-""But, Draco, you remember us right?" Marcus cut him off. He had entered the room and heard everything.Draco narrowed his eyes. "Of course I do. You're Marcus Flint. Now please don't ask stupid questions, my head hurts."The door opened and Dr. Grant entered with two nurses, a male and a female nurse, trailing behind him. "Could everyone please take a seat while I check on our patient here? Let's try not to suffocate him and take things slow."Everyone did as they were told while Narcissa rushed to Hermione's side and led her to the sofa.Hermione still looked petrified, too shocked to move from where she was standing. She watched Draco as her mind tried to process everything that has happened just a few minutes ago. Please let this be a joke Draco. Say that this is just a bloody joke to get back at me. She caught his gaze and she gave a small smile. Com' on love. Laugh now. Tell us all that this is a joke. Draco turned away and faced Dr. Grant who started to pull out a small pen from his pocket. He pressed on a small button and a light appeared on its tip. He placed it in front of Draco's eyes and examined them.Hermione felt a huge pang on her chest. She took a deep breath and blinked her tears away. Narcissa wrapped her arms around her and gave a small squeeze.Dr. Grant scribbled some notes on the metal tray and gave it to the female nurse. He took a seat at the edge of Draco's bed. He gave a warm smile. "Hello, I'm Doctor Grant. You're in the hospital and you were in a car accident. You hit your head pretty bad but you're okay now." He paused and cleared his throat. "I have some questions you need to answer and after that, we will run a complete test to check if all the wounds are healed, as well as the fractured bones. But before we begin, how are you feeling?"Draco sat up slowly and the male nurse assisted him and pushed his pillow up. "My head is aching."Dr. Grant looked at the other nurse and asked her to get some morphine. The nurse nodded and left."The headache is normal. You'll be given a pain killer in a while. Now, first question – What's your name?"Draco looked bored. "Draco Lucius Malfoy.""Good. Now, when is your birthday?""June 5, 1980 – really, this is stupid."Dr. Grant ignored him "What month is it now?""March.""Year?"He rolled his eyes. "2002.""Excellent. Now, do you know who your parents are?"Draco raised his brows. "Seriously?" He scoffed and refused to answer but finally gave in when Dr. Grant didn't give up his stare. "Fine. That woman over there is my mother Narcissa Malfoy. My father just left, to God knows where, and his name is Lucius Malfoy. I live at a huge flat in London and run my own company. I drive – well I used to drive a Black Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. My childhood is very…" He thought for a moment, choosing the right word to say without blurting out that he's a wizard to this muggle doctor. "…let's say magical… I know you get that. Is there anything else?" He glanced past the doctor's shoulder. "Oh. Those are my friends, Theo, Marcus and Blaise." His eyes landed on Hermione. "And that is…" He paused and frowned as if he was recalling something then finally looked up. "…their friend."Hermione clenched her fists and stood up abruptly which surprised Narcissa and everyone else in the room. She darted towards Draco's bed and pulled her necklace off and threw it in front of him. "It might mean something to you." She turned her heels and stormed out of the room, surprising the nurse who was about to enter."What was that about?" Draco asked the other people in the room. The nurse injected the morphine into his IV and then left again."Let's run the tests now, shall we?" Dr. Grant asked the male nurse to assist him to bring Draco to the exam room.oOoOoOoHermione ran as fast as she could. She wanted to get as far away from Draco's room as possible. She didn't care if she bumped into someone or if she looked like a fool who was crying and running in the hallway. She pushed a door open and was now in the lobby of the hospital. She went to the corner and flopped down on the couch. She buried her face in her palm and started to cry quietly.She is tired of crying. She has been crying a lot these past few days. It is a miracle that there are tears still coming out of her eyes. This has been one hell of an adventure. She snorted at the irony. She faked her amnesia then and now Draco has the amnesia.How could a man you love and loves you back ever forget about you? He remembers everyone but her. The words that came out of Draco's mouth echoed in her head. I don't know you. Who are you? That girl…is their friend.Oh, Draco, what happened? She wiped her cheeks. You forgot about me. You forgot that you love me.Hermione could sense that someone is standing in front of her. She glanced up and saw Lucius Malfoy. He was handing her his handkerchief. She hesitated at first until she accepted his offer feeling a dire need to blow her nose.Lucius took a seat across from her."Why did you walk out of the room?" Hermione said through her sobs.Lucius leaned forward in his seat and placed his cane to the side. "I owled Florence, the healer, asking if she could check on Draco tomorrow and… I was in shock, the same as you were, back there.""He remembers you." She whispered.He shifted in his seat. "You, Ms. Granger, are the smartest, bravest, and most generous witch I've ever known. You were never selfish and you always put others before you. I don't know why or how you could love my son after all the things he has said and done at Hogwarts and more so after the wedding. You have the purest heart and my son is truly lucky to have you in his life."She took a deep breath while listening to the words coming from Lucius. She can't believe her ears. Has the universe really changed its course? It truly has gone mad."I know you can't believe that I'm saying this to you after all these years – after what I've done. I don't deserve your forgiveness as well as Mr. Potter's and Mr. Weasley's… After what I have done to everyone." Lucius glanced towards the other end of the lobby.Hermione sighed. "Everyone deserves forgiveness. I've forgiven you for a long time already Lucius. Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right. I could see you're finally changing for the better." She could feel new hot tears forming in her eyes. "Draco and I… We had a second chance and I blew it." She faced the old man and let the tears fall down her face. "He can't remember me." She broke down into tears and wiped her eyes with the handkerchief Lucius handed her. "Now that I've used the second chance life has offered me, I'll never have him back. I blame myself for all that is happening."Lucius cleared his throat. He wasn't comfortable in his current situation. Muggles had started to notice the crying young woman in front of him and started to whisper. "Ms. Granger, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. And I think you're wrong. Life doesn't limit a second chance. There's a third, fourth, and so on and so forth until you made things right. Did you honestly think that I only made one mistake? I made countless mistakes and yet Narcissa and Draco are still here for me. Draco's chance to live is your chance to make things right." He took his cane and stood up slowly. "The brain, easily forgets – but the heart doesn't. I know my son loves you, even if his memories of you are forgotten." He took a few steps further away from her. He stopped and glanced at her. "So, Miss Granger, are you coming or not?"oOoOoOoDraco wasn't inside the room when Hermione and Lucius went back to his room. Narcissa walked over to where Hermione stood and took her hand. "Draco is being examined. We'll know the results as soon as he gets back." She led Hermione to the sofa. Lucius followed suit.Theo peered up from his book at Hermione. "Blaise and Marcus accompanied Draco. How are you?"Hermione looked at him, her eyes all red and puffy. "Numb."Theo took her hand and gave it a little squeeze. "He'll come around."The door opened and Draco was in a wheelchair, Blaise was pushing it, Marcus was behind them. Draco caught the sight before him. Theo's hand on Hermione's. He frowned. He was now beside his bed. "Theo, help me up here, will you?" Theo stood up and made a beeline to where Draco was. He helped Draco get back on his bed. When he was finally settled he turned his head and glanced at Hermione. "Hey, Hermione…am I correct?" Hermione nodded. He held his hand up, her necklace in his grasp. "Care to tell me what happened a while ago?"Blaise, Marcus and Theo stepped away and went back to the other end of the room. Hermione stood slowly and walked towards Draco's bed. When she was about arm length to Draco's bed, the door opened once again and Dr. Grant entered gracefully the results of the exam in his hands. Hermione turned around and rushed to where Dr. Grant was."Draco's vital signs are good." Dr. Grant announced. "He doesn't need to wear the neck brace anymore and his wounds and fractured bones are healed. He, however, has to stay for three days more here in the hospital just for observation." He peered up from the papers he was holding. "But I know that this isn't what you all wanted to hear. As you all have noticed, he remembers all of you but not –" He turned to face Hermione. " - Hermione. Draco hit his head pretty bad and now he has Lacunar Amnesia. It's like a selective memory loss. He may not remember Hermione because of a very painful memory or it might be his strongest memory." He took a quick glance at Draco over his shoulder. "I believe that before or even during the accident, Draco was holding on to one specific memory and that is…" He trailed off."Me." Hermione finished his sentence.Dr. Grant pinched the bridge of his nose. "He was holding on to his memory of you. When he hit his head and passed out, that part of his brain was truly damaged, the memory was forgotten."Hermione bit her lip, trying to stop her tears from falling again. She has to be strong. The image of Draco clinging on to his life flashed before her. He was thinking about me. "But –" she said in a soft shaky voice, "Will those memories ever come back?"Dr. Grant sighed. "In some cases, they regained their memory, others didn't. There were also cases wherein they would only remember some memories, a flash of memory which was significant to them. It could be the best day of his life - happiest, loneliest… name it. It could also be music, food, or places. But I'm not promising anything. No studies have really found any medication or treatment to regain someone's memory to work. Repeating the past could be our biggest hope.""I'll take that chance." Hermione muttered. She glanced at Draco and caught him watching her. She smiled at him and waved. Draco's brow shot up and she thought she saw a ghost smile on his lips.Lucius and Narcissa joined Dr. Grant out in the hall while Marcus made some phone calls for work. Blaise gave Draco a short pat on the back and whispered something to him. Draco took a quick look at Hermione then averted his eyes somewhere else. "I've got to go home Drake. Pansy is waiting for me. I'll tell her you're okay." He gave Hermione a quick hug as well as to Theo and waved at Marcus who was still on the phone.Hermione took a few steps closer to Draco. "Hey."Draco smirked. "Hi."Marcus walked out of the room, his phone still attached in his ear.Theo stood beside Hermione. "I told you he would be okay. Sucks that they didn't cure that smirk of his."Hermione giggled quietly. "I like his smirk just the way it is." She glanced at Draco. "I'm sorry about a while ago. I-I was just surprised and I've missed you."Theo placed his arm on her shoulder and grinned at Draco. "We missed you."Draco clenched his jaw and took Hermione's wrist and pulled her away from Theo's arm. "Don't you have any work or girlfriend to go to, Theo?"Theo laughed out loud. "I'll grab you both some lunch." He shook his head as he walked out of the room. He knew that Draco was jealous. His memory may be blurred right now but he knows Draco feels something for Hermione.Hermione looked at Draco's grasp on her wrist then back to his face. Draco sneered at the door then moved his eyes to Hermione. "Care to tell me now about this necklace? Oh, and Blaise and Marcus gave me a brief story of our – relationship. I will also know if you are lying or not, so you better tell me what happened truthfully. You are my fiancée, am I correct? Why do you have to make puppy dog eyes to my best friend?"She couldn't help but snort as she pulled her arm away. She took a seat on the armchair beside Draco's bed. "You are still the Draco Malfoy I know." She ran both of her hands through her hair. "And wait, I'm making puppy dog eyes at Theo? Theo?" She scrunched her nose. "He is a good-looking bloke but I only have eyes for someone." She smiled at him. He still looks unconvinced. She gave out a loud exasperated sigh and stood up. She took a seat at the corner of his bed. She took the necklace from his hand.He felt electricity pass through his veins from the contact. Hermione noticed his sharp gasp. She scooted from her seat closer to him."This necklace… is when I said 'Yes' to you, to forever."His brows furrowed. "So, I proposed to you with a necklace? No ring?"She smiled and shook her head. "We're really not into rings."He nodded. "Hermione." He frowned."Why do you always frown when you say my name?" She narrowed her eyes.His frowned deepened and he glanced up back again to Hermione. "I feel something whenever I say your name." He paused. "Dr. Grant said you may be the strongest memory I had… but could also be the most painful memory. Did you do something terrible to me?" He saw her face fall and he quickly tried to amend his statement. "I mean maybe you never cooked me a meal or ate my cake." He shrugged apologetically.Hermione looked down at her necklace. "Maybe." She glanced back up and put the necklace back on. "I don't know what you're trying to pull, Draco Malfoy, but right now, I'm really, really confused. I don't know if this is some kind of joke or if it's real. But whatever might be happening right now, remember that I'm your fiancée. I'll do whatever it takes to fill that gap missing in your brain."She placed her foot down the floor and stood up. She sighed and took a few steps towards the door."Hey, where are you going?" Draco called out."I need some fresh air." Hermione shrugged. She has to think of the best memory that could trigger his brain."Will you come back?" He cocked his head to the side.She smiled. "Of course."oOoOoOoA/N: NO THEO/HERMIONE here. I picture Andrew Garfield as Theo. Just saying. Please review. Oh, I have a new beta. Thanks mockingjaymyownway.

A/N: It's been a while since I've updated… I think. I had to thank my beta mockingjaymyownway for her great help to make my fic better. Thank you for the lovely reviews especially from an anonymous reader who made my day. I'm glad I've touched most of you with this fic.Chapter 22"Hermione, where are you going?" Marcus has just place his phone back on his pocket.She smiled. "I'm just going for a walk. Be back later."Marcus nodded. "Hermione, Draco loves you. It's pretty obvious that he still feels it."She gave a short nod and left.oOoOoOoHermione pushed the huge glass doors and started to take few steps away from the hospital. She stepped further and further until she reached a small park. She took a seat on one of the benches and closed her eyes taking a deep breath feeling the warm afternoon air on her skin. This felt good. The silence with only the sound of the leaves moving feels good. This place could help her think clearly and make her feel at peace.She thought of the idea of repeating the speed dating the way he did. That was the first time they fell in love with each other. She opened her eyes and leaned on the bench. She carefully placed her hands on her necklace. She could also repeat the moment where he proposed to her. That could be one of the most important memories that could trigger his brain.She sighed heavily. There are much too many memories that could trigger Draco's brain but…which one? She sighed again and stood up slowly. Her phone began to ring. She took her phone out of her pocket and saw on the small screen that it was Ginny."Hey Hermione, how are you? How is Draco?"Hermione sat back down on the bench. "He is awake. He is doing great and fully recovered but the doctor said he should stay for three more days. But –"she took a long pause and sighed. "He has Lacunar Amnesia. He – he could remember everyone but me."She heard Ginny gasp on the other line. "Oh Hermione. I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm going there right away."Hermione shook her head. "No. It's okay. I'm fine. Dr. Grant said his memory could come back anytime soon." She lied. "Just tell Harry and Ron that I'm fine. I could handle this on my own.""Okay." Ginny's voice seemed uncertain. "But if you need someone to talk to, just call me…alright?""Okay. Thanks Gin. Bye."She buried her face on her hand and tried to clear her mind once again. She'll just bring back all the memories she had shared with Draco. She glanced at each side to see if someone is around. When she found no one, she apparated back to her flat.oOoOoOoHermione opened the door of Draco's room. It's six in the evening and she brought along with her a huge brown box with her. She peeked inside and saw that Draco was the only one inside. He was reading the book she read to him while he was sleeping.He peered up from the book and saw Hermione. "What took you so long?"She opened the door widely and pushed the brown box inside. She closed the door and smiled at him. "Sorry. Where is everyone?"He shut the book close and placed it in the bedside table. "Marcus left. Theo will be back tomorrow. Father and Mother went home. They said they know I'm in good hands because – well – you're here.""Oh, if only I knew you were all alone I would've came earlier. I just went back to my flat to get some stuff." She waved at the box."It's okay. It gave me time to think." He pursed his lips. Before Hermione could even ask what he was thinking of he pointed at the box. "What's in there?"She looked excited. She strutted to Draco's bed while levitating the box. The box landed carefully on the floor while she made herself comfortable on the edge of the bed.She accioed a photo album but before she opened it she said "We had a long breakup so the oldest pictures we had together were long gone…these are the new ones…the time when we were given a second chance." She scooted closer to him and opened the album. "This is the time when we went to the Bodleian Library. I have my own spot there and you claimed it was yours." She started to smile. "We even argued before because I want you to read my favorite book but you insisted to read something else."He raised his brow. "So…you're forcing me to do something that I don't want to do?"Hermione pursed her lips. This is not going well as she expected. "At first, you didn't read it but when we had a breakup, you read it and then you liked it. You made a note too. Here." She handed him the note he wrote. He opened the small parchment carefully. His brows furrowed then shot back up. He snorted. "I can't believe I've written something like this."She looked hurt for a minute but she couldn't blame him. This is another side of Draco. The Draco without the Hermione. She has to have a lot of patience with this other Draco."Then this is when you threw me a birthday party. All twenty three years!" Her eyes lit up and she can't help but grin. "You surprised me that day. Everyone was there. For my first birthday –""Wait." Draco cut her off."Do you remember something?" Hermione searched his eyes for hope.He shook his head. "No. Hermione, I – I can't do this right now. I –"He paused and sighed, running his hand through his hair in frustration. "I really appreciate all of this but I don't know if now is the right time to do this." He bit his lip trying to find the right words to say. "When I was left alone, I had the time to think things through. I've just woken up and all of a sudden I'm engaged. The last memory I had was I'm in the conference room. It's all a blur. I don't know what to say or do. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or if I could make you happy. I don't know if I could do this." He took a deep breath and rubbed his face with his hands.Hermione don't know what to say. "I'm sorry. I just thought that now that you're awake, you wanted to know everything. We could do this another time." She was about to place the album back on the box when he took her arm."No." He groaned. "What I mean is I don't know if I could do this." He pointed to the both of them and his eyes went down to the necklace she was wearing. "This meaning...the engagement."She blinked a few times. "What?""I don't know." He shrugged, his hand still grasping on her arm. "I don't know if I'm ready to be engaged or even get married. Maybe I was ready before the accident but now I'm a total lost. I don't even know what happened between us.""You were pissed off at Theo." She blurted out.He shrugged. "I just didn't like the idea that my fiancée is too close with my best friend. But if you like Theo, then it's fine with me."Hermione scoffed. Unbelievable. She pulled her arm away from his grasp and placed the album back at the box. She can't look at Draco. She never felt more insulted in her life. How could Draco just break off the engagement and even tell her that she could just go with Theo? She bit her lip trying to cool herself down."Hermione." He placed his arm on her arm."Don't." She scooted away from him."You have to understand. I don't know what to do, what to feel, what to say…what you want. I don't know you."She raised her hand before her face. "Stop it! Just…Stop it. Don't say anything more." She stood up and took her wand out of her bag. She pointed it at the box and then it was gone. "I sent the box to your flat. You could check it out when you're ready." She looked away at the other end of the room.Hot tears started to form once again in her eyes. She has to be patient with him. She has to take things slowly just as Dr. Grant said. She should give him time. "We just have to try." She said, her voice strangled. "I'm not asking anything from you. I'll do this. All you have to do is just accept it." She wiped her tears in her eyes with the back of her hand and turned to face him. She stood up and walked closer to him. "We just have to try."She gazed into his eyes and leaned in closer. "I'm madly inlove with you Draco and I know that you feel the same way too. You just have to stop fighting it." She leaned closer and closed her eyes pressing her lips gently on his.Draco didn't know what to do. He has to admit it felt good. Her lips were soft and sweet. He closed his eyes briefly until he began to taste something salty. He opened his eyes once again and saw the tears flowing down her face. He pulled away and wiped the tears on her eyes with his thumb. Hermione kept her eyes close. He pulled her closer and kissed her once again. He kissed her deeply and snaked his arms around her. She started to run her hand through his hair tugging it gently. He kissed her again, deeply, passionately and longingly.He will try. He will try for this woman who clearly loves him. He never knew anyone who could love him like she does. He has decided to give this a try.But, how long will he try?oOoOoOoIt was dark. He tried to reach something and he couldn't figure out what he was trying to reach. He saw a woman with brunette hair."Hey. Who are you?"The woman began to ran away from him."Hey! Stop! My name is Draco Malfoy and I'm lost."The woman stop but didn't turn to face him.Draco ran as fast as he could until he was finally an arm length away from the woman. "Who are you? I need help."The woman glanced slightly to the side and placed her arm up showing a bracelet as she started to tuck the strand of hair behind her ear. She was about to turn when she finally disappeared.oOoOoOoDraco shot up from his bed. A thin blanket of sweat covered his forehead. Hermione woke up from the chair beside his bed startled from Draco's scream."What's wrong Draco?" She placed her hand on his."I saw someone in my dream." Draco managed to say through heavy breath.Hermione stood up and sat on his bed. "Really? Who?"He shrugged. "I'm not sure."Hermione pulled him closer and wrapped her arms around him. "Shh. It's okay. I'm here."He can't figure out what he was feeling. Part of him was glad that Hermione was here but he still isn't sure if this is right. This is unfair for her. He said he would try but he feared that he would just lead her on and still he won't be able to recover his memory. What if he doesn't recover his memory? Would he ever love her the way she loves him? He could never make her happy and he might not be happy as well.He pulled away. "I'm fine now. Thank you." He lay back down on his bed and turned away from her.She smiled sadly and sat back down to her seat and continued the book she was reading.A/N: Trying to update the next chapter after this. Thanks for the wonderful reviews and don't forget to review again.

A/N: Trying to update before I become very VERY busy. Please review! Love you all.Chapter 23"I can't wait to go home. It's bloody frustrating here. I've got lots of work to do." He groaned as he watched the people by his window rushing their way to work. He was already out of his bed wearing his white shirt and gray pyjamas.Hermione grinned. "You didn't seem to mind missing work before."He stared up at her looking aghast. "What? How could that be possible? I've worked so hard for my company. Why would I miss work?"She shrugged apologetically. "So you could spend time with me."He looked down for a moment and shook his head in disbelief. "Wow."Hermione felt a huge pang on her chest. She could clearly see his annoyance and disappointment but she should push it aside. She's dealing with a different version of Draco. Again, the Draco without Hermione. She should continue what she's doing and hope that someday her Draco would come back.They heard someone enter. "Anyone hungry?"Draco smirked. "Perfect timing Theo. I'm famished."Theo placed two brown bags down and gave Draco a quick hug. "It's nice to see you out of bed. How are you feeling?"Draco groaned. "I can't wait to get out of here. I'm bored."Theo chuckled. "How could you be bored? Hermione is here with you to keep you company. You've always wished this moment to have her all to yourself." He smiled slyly.Draco ignored his friend and checked the contents in the brown bag.Theo shrugged and gave Hermione a quick hug. "How are you?" He said.She pulled away. "I'm good. Draco's fine. Dr. Grant is annoyed with all this complaining and whining so he's good to go tomorrow."Theo glanced at his shoulder and saw Draco opening a plastic container. "Did you try and help him fill up the missing gap of his brain?" He turned back to face her."I tried once…yesterday…but he said he isn't ready."Theo nodded and led her to the table. They could see Draco eating happily eating pancakes with bacon and eggs on the side. Theo helped himself out with his own plastic container while Hermione took a sip of tea on her cup. She secretly watched Draco eat.It's still the same man she fell in love with. His actions are still the same. He would still pour maple syrup neatly on his pancakes. At first he would start in the middle then slowly move it in circles until his pancake is covered with maple syrup. Then he would cut it off like in small pieces like a pizza. He also has this pattern, pancake-bacon-pancake-egg. He took his coffee and drank slowly. She smirked. Draco is the only person she knew who drank coffee without the milk and the sugar. He has this thing about tasting the richness or pureness of the coffee. He placed his coffee down and noticed that she was watching him.Hermione looked away and took a bite of her pancake. She peeked through the corner of her eye and saw he was still looking at her. She cocked her head to the side. "What?"Draco snorted. "I should ask you that question."Hermione playfully rolled her eyes and noticed a maple syrup on his cheek. "Oh wait." She placed her finger on his cheek and wiped the syrup away. She placed her finger on her mouth to clean the maple syrup away. His brows shot up."What?" She asked again."It's the first time someone has ever done that to me."Theo took a sip from his cup and wiped his mouth with a table napkin. "Drake, she's been doing tha-" Hermione kicked him on his shin under the table."Ow! Did you kick me?" He glanced at Hermione."I did not." Hermione said and pointed at Draco. "Did you?"Draco shook his head like it's no big deal and continued to eat. Theo faced Hermione and gave her a 'what-the-fuck' look. Hermione glared at him and mouthed the word 'Shut up.'The door opened and a nurse who has a name tag 'Beth' entered. She looked like she's in her thirties and has a strawberry blonde hair. She was holding a medium-sized plastic bag. "Mr. Draco these were the things we found in your car."Draco stood up abruptly not finishing his food. He took the plastic bag from her grasp and checked the contents. There was his bag, his wallet as well as his keys and cell phone."Before I forget Mr. Draco, the police would like a word with you tomorrow before you leave the hospital. Is there anything you need?" Beth asked. He waved his hand dismissively while checking the documents in his bag."Good. I've finished the deadlines on time. I should just call work and check on the reports." He took his phone but frowned because it was dead. "Can I borrow a phone?" He looked at Hermione and Theo. Theo handed him his.Draco started to make some calls and went out of the room due to poor signal."Why did you kick me?" Theo rubbed his shin under the table."Sorry but talking about something about me and him in the past pisses him off. He's different now." Hermione carefully glanced at her shoulder to see if Draco would come in any minute. "I'm just taking things slowly. Baby steps."Theo nodded. "Fine. But you do owe me."Hermione smiled. "Sure."oOoOoOo"I would just check something in the studio. Is it alright if I leave you here?" Hermione asked while shrugging her cardigan on."Yeah. Theo is here. Go." Draco said without looking at her. He was reading some documents in his bed.Hermione gave a half smile and waved at both Theo and Draco and left the room."What's wrong with you mate?" Theo hit Draco on his left arm."Ow! Is it really necessary to do that?" Draco rubbed the spot Theo hit."Yeah it is especially the way you treat your fiancée. Not cool mate."Draco groaned. "I don't bloody hell know her.""You aren't trying. You love her Drake and it's pretty obvious how much she loves you." Theo waved his hand in front of his pointing at Draco."If you care so much about her then why won't you date her?" Draco folded his arms and narrowed his eyes.Theo hung his head in defeat. "Come on Drake. It's not like that. Don't even go there."Draco ran his hands through his messy hair. "I know. But, could you all please give me time?"Theo waved his hand dismissively. "Sure. Take all the time you want. Just don't wait for me to say 'I told you so.'""I have to ask you something though." Draco pursed his lips."Hm?""Do you know anyone who has a platinum bracelet? I've been seeing it in my dreams lately."Theo shook his head. "Nope." He fished out his phone on his pocket and texted Hermione.oOoOoOo"Hi Elena, is Ginny here?" Hermione asked once she entered the studio."Hi Hermione. How are you? Ginny is attending one client right now in the office.""I'm good, thanks. I'll just get something in my office." She walked deeper into the studio and Ginny instantly saw her."Hermione!" Ginny stood up abruptly and excused herself from the client who was sitting on the chair in front of her desk. She gave Hermione a warm hug."How are you?""I'm fine. Let's not talk about it right now. Who is our client over there?" She glanced passed Ginny's shoulder.Ginny pulled Hermione inside her office. The beautiful young woman stood and gave them a warm smile. Hermione instantly recognized who this woman was. They share the same hair color, only she has long straight hair and green eyes. Obviously she looked like she came from a wealthy family because of those shining diamond earrings, expensive coat and those high heeled pumps that looks like she never use it out in the street. She has good posture too.The young woman offered her hand. "Hi Hermione Granger. It's me, Astoria Greengrass."Hermione shook it gently. "Hi Astoria. Please, sit."Astoria took a seat while Ginny went back to hers. Hermione stood beside Ginny."Hermione, Astoria here wants us to be their official photographer for the launch of her new clothing line.""I wanted to ask you both personally to explain the details and hope that you will agree to work for me." Astoria smiled sweetly.Hermione nodded. "Sure. We could reserve the date and talk about things right away." Ginny took a paper and pen.Astoria clapped her hands in delight. "Oh thank you. I'm glad you both are the photographers. I've seen the pictures you've all taken and I'm speechless.""Thanks." Hermione smiled. "So when is the event?""It's five days from now, March 16, Saturday at 9 in the evening at the Greengrass Hotel Grand Ballroom. There would also be a photoshoot on Wednesday with the models and the new clothing line. I'll show you the designs right now so you could think of a concept for the photoshoot." She took out a large black portfolio from her very small bag. "Here."Ginny took the black portfolio and started to flip the pages. "Wow, Astoria. These designs looks great. What do you think Hermione?"Hermione gave a short laugh. "You want to ask me? The person without any fashion sense?"Ginny grinned. "Yeah. Bad idea. So what do you think would be the right concept for these clothes?"Hermione leaned closely. They look like the sophisticated long dresses…or are they gowns with weird cuts and colors. "I think a Romantic concept. Those like vintage, castle themed places?"Astoria nodded. "I agree. I wanted to bring sophistication in my design.""So what time on Wednesday?" Ginny glanced up at Astoria."It's at seven in the morning up until we wrapped it all up. I'll pay triple." Astoria smiled sweetly showing her perfect white teeth."Okay. So we'll see you then." Ginny closed the black portfolio and handed it back to Astoria."Oh, wait. I could pay in advance for your service today and you both have to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement, you know, for the designs I've just showed you." She took out a check with a huge sum of money and also a black folder with the NDA document. "Just sign there while I make some calls."Ginny and Hermione glanced at one another and shrugged at the same time. They don't really care about the designs but if it makes Astoria comfortable, then what's the harm. Astoria went out of the office and started talking to someone in her phone."So how are you?" Ginny asked while reading the document."Frankly, I'm not okay. Draco is different because of the amnesia. I mean, he does the same things but when it comes to me, he seems really annoyed.""Just give him time." Ginny placed her hand on Hermione's arm."That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to be very patient with him but sometimes he pushes it already. He's been having nightmares too. Theo just texted me and he said Draco said something about a platinum bracelet. It gave me hope. He gave me a platinum bracelet before. I know I kept it in my desk here in the office. It might be the bracelet he's referring to."Ginny's lips formed a small 'o'. "Then go find it. It might bring his memories back."Hermione nodded and was about to leave Ginny's office when Astoria came back inside."Did you sign it already?" Astoria gave a forceful smile. It seems like she's hiding something.Hermione took her wand and pointed it to the black folder. Her signature instantly appeared in the NDA. She immediately left and went to her office.Ginny signed the NDA as well and handed it back to Astoria. "Thank you. I'll see you both on Wednesday, okay?"Ginny nodded.oOoOoOoHermione opened a desk after desk after desk and thanked Merlin she finally found the silver box with the platinum bracelet in it. Without opening the box, she placed it back on her bag and hoped that it was the bracelet Draco was referring to.She waved goodbye to Ginny and Elena and started to walk out of her studio. When she was out and on her way to the hospital Astoria rolled down the window of her car. "Hermione, hop in. I'll give you a lift."Hermione bit her lip. "No. It's okay. I'll just take a cab.""I insist. I've got nothing to do anyway. Just think of it as a thank you gift." Astoria smiled again with her fake smile."Okay." Hermione opened the car door and took a seat beside Astoria. She placed her bag on the car floor."I've heard about Draco. Is he okay?" Astoria said."Yeah. He's good to go tomorrow.""My mother was worried about him. We just sealed an investment deal with his company." She said in her cold voice.More like they were more concerned with the investment deal than with Draco's life. Hermione stopped herself from rolling her eyes."So, you're on your way back to the hospital?"Hermione nodded.There was an awkward silence during their trip to the hospital. Hermione kept her head away from Astoria and just watched the people walking and chatting outside. They finally arrived in the hospital and Hermione hurriedly went out of the car taking her bag with her."Thanks for the lift." Hermione smiled."Pleasures all mine." Astoria smiled.Hermione closed the door shut and ran as fast as she could back to Draco's room. She opened the door and saw Theo glancing up at her with a questioning brow. She nodded slightly and sat beside Draco's bed."Hey Draco, I wanted to show you something." She didn't wait for him to respond and took out the silver box in her bag. "You gave this to me before." She opened the box slowly and Draco looked confused more than ever."I gave you an empty box?"Theo dug his face in his hand and Hermione checked the box. It really was empty. "What? Oh. It wasn't empty. It has a bracelet… a platinum bracelet."He scoffed and looked at Theo. "I knew you would tell her about the bracelet."Theo's head shot up. "I didn't tell her anything.""Yeah right. Look, Hermione, you've given me enough evidence that we're together and I'll check it out soon once I go back to my flat. It's okay. You don't need to do this."Hermione felt like she was about to cry. "Sure." That's all she managed to say. "I'll-" Her voice broke. She took a step away from him and left the room once again. She admits that she didn't check the box if it contained the bracelet. She was too excited to show him that she didn't check. Now Draco thinks that she's lying and she would only do things to make him remember. Now it would be even more difficult for her to let him know her, to make him fall inlove with her again.oOoOoOoAstoria looked out of her window and can't help but form a smirk on her pink glossy lips. She recalls what she had overheard in Ginny's office. She's damn lucky that she is now given another chance to prove Draco that they were really meant to be and not with Hermione Granger. Now that Draco has amnesia, she could do a double-take of what she's done wrong before – before he turned her down. She opened her palm and smirked some more. On her palm was the platinum bracelet with different snowflake charms in it. "You're mine Draco Malfoy."oOoOoOoA/N: Wow, this is longer than I expected. Please review. Thanks! Oh, one reader gave me a very interesting plot for another fic. I'll see what I can do about it. Thanks again.





--------




A/N: I don't know why the font style became 'bold' when I updated the chapter 23. Anyone care to tell me why this happened? By the way, thank you for the reviews. I really REALLY appreciate it and it really encourages me to finish this fic. I do want to end this fic because all the stories I've written (not here in fanfic) never reached its end. This would be the first story I would finish.Chapter 24I need one strong impact, just one huge impact that could bring my Draco back. I don't know how to do it but I know that fate would lead me the way to find that one impact someday. I could give him the time. I could give him all the time he needs. Space? I could compromise with that. When I was the one who pretended to have amnesia, he was patient with me. He did a lot of things for me to make me fall in love with him again. Now, I would do the same for him. I don't care if it's for days or weeks, or months or years. I love him so much that I am willing to take risks. I'm willing to get hurt. I'm willing to wait."Thank you for your time Mr. Malfoy." The police officer held his hand out and Draco shook it firmly. "Thank you officer."Theo and Hermione stood and shook the officer's hand. They said their thanks and were left once again in the spacious room."Finally that's over. I could go home already." Draco grinned and took his bag at the edge of the hospital bed. "Let's leave this hell hole."oOoOoOo"Tuesday. Today is Tuesday." Hermione said to herself as she scribbled some notes in her organizer. "Tomorrow is the photo shoot, Thursday and Friday is Draco day – hm- Saturday night is the launch. Sunday is Draco day…" She scribbled some more. She was seating on the loveseat of Draco's flat.Hermione seemed satisfied with her plan for the week. She placed her organizer back inside her bag as she waited for Draco to come out of his room. He was getting dressed for the dinner meeting with the VP of his company also with the COO. Of course she was opposed to this because he just came home from the hospital but she knew well that if she didn't keep her mouth shut, she would only make things worse.She heard the door open and her heart immediately stopped. Even though she's seen Draco every day, she always gets this butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling and the oh-my-goodness-he's-so-hot moments. Draco was wearing a crisp black suit with a matching black shirt and silver tie. He was wearing his expensive Italian leather shoes. His hair was neat but messy at the same time. The bruises were finally gone and so are the cuts in his brow and lip. He peered to her and noticed the way she looked at him. He smirked. "I guess you love it." He started to fix his tie.Hermione strutted to where he was standing. "Here, let me help you." Their fingers brushed briefly and both felt the electricity just from the simple contact. He drew his hands back while she continued to fix his tie. He watched her as she did this and noticed her long lashes and her tired hazel eyes. In some odd way, he felt the warmth coming from her simple look. Every time she looked at him there's always something tugging in his stone cold heart which feared him to death. She really is beautiful but he still isn't sure if he could ever return what she felt for him. He felt bad for always hurting her, but who could blame him? He barely knew her. She was willing to give him time, but how long does he need? He has to convince her to move on with her life. He was just pulling her back."There." She smiled and looked up at him through her lashes. He looked at her hazel eyes once more. She blushed and turned around and went back to her seat. "Are you sure you could go to that meeting?""Yup. The restaurant is owned by a wizard so I could just floo over there.""Oh okay. I'll be staying here and wait for you to come home."He closed his eyes briefly and sighed. He darted to where she was seated and sat across her. "Hermione." He paused. "Hermione, I really appreciate that you are willing to stay here and wait but I told you –"She held both her hands up. "I'll go. Space. Time. Got it." She managed to smile and started to collect her things. "The box of our 'memories' are in your room." She started to stand."Hermione." He tried to say something but he was lost at words. The feeling seemed familiar. Hermione sat back and glanced at him."No. I get it Draco. I don't want to force you to remember me nor do I want to suffocate you by being by your side every day.""I don't want to jeopardize your work. You know how I feel about the work issue. I just want you to continue what you do every day. We could see each other once or twice a week. Not…everyday."Every day is being with you. Every day is Draco Day. She bit her tongue before she could say it out loud. I guess there would be changes for my schedule this week. "I understand."Draco studied her for a minute then finally, he smirked. "Thank you…you know…for everything."She blinked the tears away and nodded. She stood up and slung her bag on her shoulder. Draco stood as well. There was an awkward silence surrounding them."I don't have my phone with me. It's still dead. I'll call you when I'm home. I- I should go. You should too. It's getting late." Draco scratched the back of his neck."Yeah. It is getting late. I should go." Hermione took a step back."Take care Hermione and go straight home."Hermione can't help but smile. "Promise." She took another step back.Draco turned on his heel and took a step towards the fireplace.She turned and their backs are now facing each other. Draco sighed in frustration debating whether he should say or do something. He doesn't know how this engagement thing works. She started to take a step then another. Draco turned to face her. "Hermione."She glanced back at him. "Yes?""Take care."She smirked. "You told me that already.""I did. Didn't I?" He shrugged. "I had to say it again so you won't forget."She raised her brow. Is he serious?He smirked and understood why she looked at him that way. He mentally smacked himself in the head for being stupid. "Okay. But I was serious about how you should continue doing all the things you do every day. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Go do your thing."She nodded. "Alright. Bye, Draco."He gasped. He doesn't know why those words made him feel something strange. Before he could say anything else, Hermione has left his flat.oOoOoOo"Mr. Draco Malfoy… how are you?" Mr. Heindrichs, the VP of his company, shook his hand firmly."I feel great Mr. Heindrichs. Thank you.""It's good to see you again Mr. Draco." Another man, who looks five years older than him shook his hand."Thank you Mr. Evans. It's nice to be back. Shall we?"They all took a seat at a secluded corner of the restaurant. The waiter handed them the menu while another waiter poured some Pinot Grigio to their glass."Tell Chef Loiseau that Sir Draco Malfoy is here with us. He'll know what we want." Mr. Heindrichs handed his menu to the waiter. Draco and Philippe (Mr. Evans) handed them theirs."Draco, how is your fiancée?" Philippe asked as he took a sip of his wine."She's fine. But we're here to talk about business." He replied. "How do you know my fiancée?" He really has to ask. He never ever brought any girlfriend to his office much more a fiancée.Philippe looked at him like he's grown two heads but then remembered that Draco had forgotten about Hermione. Blaise and Marcus gave them a head start."Well, she visits you at work but most of the time you visit her at her studio. You two are inseparable." He started to laugh. "You were even jealous when I talk to her…too possessive over your fiancée."Draco cocked his head to the side. "I am. Am I?" He knows how attractive Philippe is. Opposite to him, Philippe has raven hair, dark eyes showing a hint of Italian blood in him. He also has a square jaw and stubble on his chin.Mr. Heindrichs nodded and smiled showing fine wrinkles at the corner of his eyes. Mr. Heindrichs is older than both men. He is already in his forties and there is a hint of gray in his brunette hair. "She is your lucky charm Draco."He raised his brow. "But she said I missed work a couple of times just to be with her.""That's just it. You finish work earlier or on time. Clients were impressed." Mr. Heindrichs adjusted his glasses. Philippe nodded in agreement."Can we not talk about my fiancée? Let's talk about the company." He shifted from his seat feeling very uncomfortable at the moment.oOoOoOoThe main course was divine. It's been a while since Draco had eaten a fine French cuisine. He could still taste the Delmonico he ordered. It's a hand-cut bone-in top loin steak topped with pink peppercorn, cognac and leek reduction. Chef Loiseau has done an excellent job. He sure would send him his thanks personally.He took one last sip of his wine. Mr. Heindrichs pulled out some documents in his leather bag. "Draco, you should check this out." Heindrichs handed the documents to Draco."The Richards opened a new branch in New York?" He raised his brows and whistled at the total sales of the Richards Power Group of Companies."I thought the Richards never wanted to expand their company to the west?""It's Andrew. He resides in New York now." Philippe continued. "It's the best outcome of his sudden decision to leave.""Why would Andrew leave?" Draco frowned."No one knows exactly why but what he did was brilliant. I think we should open a new branch in America." Heindrichs suggested."I'll think about it." Draco took a sip on his glass. "That's a big decision to make."oOoOoOoThe dinner meeting was finally over and Draco felt a little pissed from all the wine he drank. Heindrichs and Philippe went ahead while Draco went to where the grand fireplace was. He was a few feet away from the fireplace when he heard someone call out to him."Draco! Draco Malfoy."He turned and saw Astoria waving at him. She strutted her way to where he stood. She was standing in front of him "It is you. How are you? I've heard about the accident and my heart was really crushed." She kissed him in his right cheek."I'm fine Astoria. I have to go home now, excuse me." He tried to turn on his heel but Astoria took his arm."So you do remember me. I thought you had amnesia?"Draco pried his arm away. "It's personal."Astoria tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear slowly. She purposely did this to show the bracelet with snowflakes charm. Draco caught a glimpse of the bracelet and took her arm. "Where did you get this?"She pretended to look hurt. "You gave it to me a few months ago.""I can't remember giving you anything." He tightened his grip. Astoria winced in pain."You did! Let me go Draco. You're hurting me. You've been hurting me for a long time now especially when you cheated on me with Granger."His eyes grew wide and let her go. "What did you say?""I know you better than she does. She flirted with you and you gave in. You left me all alone. I kept this bracelet because I know someday you'll come back to me.""I don't believe you. She's my fiancée. Everyone knows that." He said bitterly."I can prove it to you Draco. I can prove that I'm the woman you see in your dreams. I know you more than Granger. You still love me but you were too blinded with Granger.""We're just friends Astoria. What we had in Hogwarts is done and over."She placed her hand in front of her face. "Stop it. Stop fighting it. Everyone thought you love Granger, but you still secretly meet me somewhere. You don't like what she does to you. She manipulates you. She stops you from going to work. Heindrichs and Philippe were lying to you. I know – I've overheard your meeting a while ago. They run your company now. That's why they enjoy the distraction you have. They know Granger. They know she could stop you from work that's why they make you believe that she's a good influence to you. Believe me. Don't trust anybody. Everyone knows you have amnesia and they could use it and take advantage of you." A tear fell from her cheek. "I love you too much Draco. I don't want to see you get hurt again." She turned and left.Draco was left speechless watching Astoria walk away from the restaurant. She had the bracelet, the bracelet that was in his dream. He was now more confused than ever.The way Hermione talks about their relationship, the way she described how he acted around her…it didn't seem like him. He never wrote love notes nor does he miss work for a date. Astoria was the woman who knew about how he runs his company. Astoria was a special girl to him during Hogwarts. She knows how this works, being raised by a powerful family, having to put business before anything else.Who should he believe?"Everyone knows you have amnesia and they could use it and take advantage of you." He remembered what Astoria said just a few minutes ago. It is true. Now that everyone knows about his accident and his amnesia, everyone could take advantage of it."I can prove it to you Draco. I can prove that I'm the woman you see in your dreams. I know you more than Granger. You still love me but you were too blinded with Granger."How could she prove it? Hermione seem to know a lot about him too… although a different version of him. He stepped into the fireplace and took a handful of floo powder. "Zabini Manor." He yelled.oOoOoOoA/N: Astoria is a bitch, I know. But there has to be a bitch in a story, right? Haha! If you ask me why I put her, it's time for Hermione to do something for Draco. It's time for her to fight for him. Let's see if this new problem would fix them or break them. This is going somewhere, I promise. Please review and thanks for the reviews and the new readers who made this their favorite story. Love lots.

A/N: Thank you for the lovely reviews. I've read one particular review and that reader gave me an idea for another fic. It's a great idea and I'll try to put it into writing…but I'm not promising anything yet.Chapter 25I can't tell Blaise what Astoria just told me. I don't know how my friends became friends with Hermione nor do I know how much they talk with one another. If I ask Blaise, I'm sure it would reach Hermione in just a fleeting second and it would cost me ever knowing the truth.Draco dusted himself and took a step away from the fireplace.So what am I doing here? Should I ask Blaise? Should I ask him not to mention anything to anyone? Blaise has always been my best friend. I know he would never betray me. I know he would tell me the truth. He walked deeper to the Zabini Manor to a long hallway.What if Astoria was telling the truth?Has he been cheating on his relationship with Hermione for a few months now? He did cheat on his past relationships before. What difference does it make now?Now he felt worst than ever. He wasn't only hurting Hermione now but he's been hurting her for months. How could he do that? Sure, he could do anything he wants but to cheat on his fiancée? Something is definitely off but what Astoria said sounded more like him. He really needed to talk to Blaise.Astoria claimed that she knew me more than Hermione. What does that even mean? Should I allow her to prove her point?Draco opened the huge double Oakwood doors to the library. "Blaise."Blaise placed the newspaper he was reading down on top of his desk and glanced up at him. "What took you so long to reach the library?" Blaise knew it was Draco because he placed a magic spell around his manor to know who among his friends are in his home."I was thinking…" He shifted from foot to foot. "Where's Pansy and Carlos?" Carlos is Blaise and Pansy's son."They are asleep. It is late already." Blaise said slowly as if he was talking to a child. "I know something is bothering you Drake, so spill."Draco took a seat on a single couch. "You're my best mate, right?"Blaise nodded slowly."And you would tell me the truth."Blaise nodded."And I could trust-""Just spill it Drake. I do need some rest too you know."Draco gave out a loud sigh. "I've been with Hermione for a long time, right?"Blaise nodded once more. "Yeah. Why?"Draco scratched the back of his neck. "Did I-" He paused. "Did I ever cheat on her?"Blaise raised his brows and snorted. "This is what it is all about?" He gave a short laugh and stood. He took a bottle of scotch and poured generously on two glasses. He gave one to Draco and then took a seat across his friend. "Draco, the bottom line is this…you are madly in love with Hermione. You guys split up for almost a year and a half and you've dated other women but no one could ever replace her. No. One. You saw her again after a long time and you tried to win her back. You've succeeded, you know. You had her back. You are jealous of everyone who ever talked to Hermione. Hell, you even had a fight with Andrew."Draco sat upright. "I did?""You did. Andrew courted Hermione when you guys split." Blaise waved a hand. "You shouldn't be asking me this. If you want any clarity, you should ask Hermione yourself." He took a sip from his glass."So, I never cheated on Hermione?" Draco asked again."No. I know you would never cheat on her. Even if you did, I know you would've told me." Blaise placed his glass down. "Where is this all coming from?"Draco downed his glass. "Nothing. I just want to know that I have a clean slate."Blaise raised his brow. He knows Draco was hiding something. "Sure. Is there anything else you want to ask?"Draco shook his head. He placed the glass down on the coffee table and stood. "Nothing more. Thanks Blaise. I'll see you around." Without looking back he left the library and flooed back to his flat.oOoOoOoI think I should just forget what Astoria said. I know Blaise. Blaise would never lie to me. I should trust his words more than Astoria. I should trust Hermione.The following morning, Draco went back to his office and started to work. He got his new car and he drove it smoothly and with ease. He wasn't like any other people who had an accident and gets traumatized. Maybe it was the fact that he doesn't remember the accident that made him drive that way.Everyone greeted him and asked how he was. He even received a call from his parents. They were out of town and send their regards to Hermione. Hermione called him too and told him she's on her way to a photo shoot. She asked him if she could pass by later and he said she could. He could hear her smile over the phone. He never thought that was possible.Hermione is okay. Draco quite enjoys her company. However, he can't point out what he feels for her right now. He knew he loved her. He just doesn't know if he could love her the same way he did before. Based on Hermione's stories, he seemed different. He isn't sure if he's comfortable to do the things he did. He is an ambitious man. He is hard working, focused and really not into commitment. How did things change? How did Hermione change him?He heard a beep from his office phone. "Sir, your meeting with Mr. Heindrichs is in five minutes."He pressed a button. "Okay, I'll be there."oOoOoOo"Are you excited?" Ginny grinned at her friend while setting up their equipment. They could see the models getting their hair and makeup done. The dresses looked fabulous in person than it did in the portfolio. It is obvious they were made with expensive cloths and jewelries.The setting was in an old castle. It really has this romantic, sophisticated vibe that would definitely fit the design of these dresses. Hermione made a mental note to herself that she would go back to this place and take more photos, without the models, without the glitz and glam."For the photo shoot or for Draco?" Hermione giggled and tested the lighting with her camera."Both." Ginny finished setting up and brushed her hands."Then my answer is 'Yes'" Hermione grinned. She can't believe Draco agreed to see her later. She better finish this shoot quick so she could see him as soon as possible. She could ask Ginny to take over during lunch. She cooked lunch for Draco, his favorite spaghetti and meatballs. There are also three red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting, which she baked. She made a fondant which looked like Draco and placed it on top of the frosting. One cupcake has a face of Draco smirking. The other he was smiling. The other he was frowning. She placed it in a metal container which she placed a spell where it could keep it warm. She could drop by in his office to give his lunch then go back to the shoot, finish, and then she could meet him again after work. "I'll pass by to his office later at lunch. Is that okay?"Ginny nodded. "Of course it's okay. He's your fiancé after all."Astoria smirked when she overheard their conversation. She darted towards their direction with another woman."Hermione, Ginny." She gave them an air kiss and plastered on her winning smile. "This is Violet, one of my co-designers for these lovely dresses."Violet shook their hands. "It's nice to meet you both.""So, shall we start?" Astoria clapped her hands. She waved at an assistant and the models walked towards them.Hermione directed one beautiful Italian woman and began their shoot. "Okay, that's it. Lovely. Now don't tilt your head too high. That's it."oOoOoOoHermione checked her watch. It was almost lunch time for Draco. She prepared the lunch she made for him and placed it on a paper bag. She was about to leave when Astoria called her over."Hermione? Where are you going?""I'm just going out for a while. I'll be back soon."Astoria was just an arm away from her. "I'm sorry but we should redo a shoot. The lighting was awful and it didn't flatter the dress."Hermione pointed at Ginny. "Ginny could handle it. She knows what to do."Astoria placed her hand in front of her. "No. Ginny would continue her work and you could just do this tiny little shoot with the model again. We could finish faster if both of you would do this shoot at the same time."Hermione looked at the paper bag she was holding. "But-"Astoria looked down at the paper bag. "What is that?"Hermione glanced up at her and smiled. "It's lunch, I would just give it to Draco for a while then I'll be back soon."The corner of Astoria's lips curved. "Oh, if you want, we could just ask one of our assistants to send it over to Draco so we could continue the shoot. You could just put a card in it telling it came from you."Hermione bit her lip. She did want to see Draco now, but then she would see him later in the afternoon. If she did the shoot now, she would finish earlier too. "O-okay. Thanks." She took out a small piece of paper and a pen from her bag. She scribbled something and then placed it inside the paper bag. She handed it to Astoria. "Thanks, Astoria." Hermione went back inside the area of the shoot."Marco." Astoria called out to one of the assistants in the area. She took out the piece of paper and placed it back in her pocket. Marco was beside her. "Make sure Hermione or Ginny is busy, tell Violet as well. I'll be gone for a while." Marco nodded and went to where Violet was standing.oOoOoOoDraco checked his watch. It's time for lunch. He was about to leave when his office phone rang. "Sir, Miss Astoria Greengrass is here." He rolled his eyes and was about to say no but decided that he needed to talk to her. He pushed the button. "Send her in."In a few minutes, Astoria entered his office. She was wearing an emerald silk blouse, white coat and black high-waist pencil skirt. She was wearing black high-heeled pumps on her feet. She was wearing the platinum bracelet too. Astoria dresses differently than Hermione. Astoria wears elegant and expensive clothes. Hermione, on the other hand wears casual clothes. They are totally different. But, if he were to look at it, he dated women more like Astoria."I brought you something." Astoria placed the paper bag down on the coffee table on the other corner of the office. "I know its lunch time and I brought you lunch." She glanced at him and smiled sheepishly.Draco strode across the room where she stood. "You lied to me." He said in a cold voice it made her shiver. But she didn't back down. "I know. I just really miss you." She tried to reach out to him but he took a step back."Why did you say all those things? How could you?" He snarled."I did it because I love you. I want you to give me a chance to prove to you that I know you more than Hermione." She took a step closer to which Draco took a step back. She stopped and sighed. "Okay. I'm sorry for lying. I – I'm really, truly sorry. But I know you are not happy with Hermione. She makes you believe that you're a different guy. I know you. I know how focused you are at work. You put your company first before anything else. That's you right? That's the Draco Malfoy." She scoffed. "Do you honestly picture yourself doing all those things she claims you do?" She gave a questioning brow.Draco looked away. Astoria had a point. He isn't the kind of man who would write love notes, leave work to surprise his girlfriend and call her from time to time."Well?" Astoria folded her arms."No." Draco looked down on his foot.Astoria smirked. "Very well then, give me time to prove that I know you more than she does. Let me prove to you that you're better with me. Besides, if we would join my company to yours…" she trailed off. "It would be the most powerful company in the whole world." She took a step closer, Draco didn't take a step back. "Come. I made this lunch especially for you." She took his hand and led him to the couch. He took a seat. "I didn't know you could cook."Astoria slowly took out the contents of the paper bag. "Well, I've been learning during my free time.""So what did you cook?"Astoria bit her lip. "Well…" She tried to open the plastic container but she can't figure out how. She hated these muggle things. And she never place her lunch over plastic containers. It's just disgusting."Need any help?" Draco took the plastic container.Astoria gave a short laugh. "I'm sorry. This thing always gets stuck."Draco pulled the lock of the plastic container and glanced up at her as if to say 'That's how you do it'. He saw what was inside and it was his favorite dish, spaghetti and meatballs. He glanced up at her again wide eye. Astoria blushed.Draco placed the container on top of the coffee table and started to mix the sauce with the pasta. He swirled it on his fork and ate. He closed his eyes briefly, it tasted so good. "Wow. This is delicious."Astoria smiled and sat beside him. Draco offered her a slice of the meatball. Astoria shook her head. She doesn't eat these kinds of things. She hated spaghetti. It's messy and the carbs…no, she just hates spaghetti."Go ahead. I ate already a while ago." Astoria pulled out the other container and opened it. She knew how to open it now. It was the red velvet cupcakes. Draco stopped eating. He saw the cupcakes with fondants that looked slightly like him. He was speechless. He never knew Astoria could do this."Just for you Draco." She smiled."Thank you." Draco smiled. He was in awe with the cupcakes. No one has ever done this to him before."But you should finish up now and go back to work. Astoria pulled out her phone inside her bag. "I also have to finish my own work."Draco finished his food and then took a bite of the cupcake. It was moist and its sweetness is just right. "This is so good." He offered the other cupcake to her. She shook her head again. "I made it for you Draco. You should finish it all." She smiled sweetly."I'll just finish the last two cupcakes later." He covered the container again. He was really full. He began to clean the containers when Astoria stopped him. "You shouldn't do that. Let your assistant clean it up. You might get tired."Astoria offered him a glass of orange juice. "Here."He muttered his thanks."Draco, I was thinking, we should get to know more about each other." Astoria said. "Later, after work? We could go to a fine restaurant."Draco shook his head. "I can't. I'm meeting Hermione later."Astoria looked down at her hands. "Okay. I understand. I just… never mind." She tried to collect her things."You just what?" Draco took her arm."I just thought, after this, after what I've done, you would want to get to know me more."Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. "I promised Hermione."Astoria folded her arms. "You could see her again tomorrow. Please, Draco. Give me your time tonight."Draco sighed. Perhaps he could just reschedule tomorrow with Hermione. "Okay. I'll tell Hermione.""But you can't tell her you'll come to see me." Astoria said quickly.He raised his brow. "Why not?"Astoria playfully rolled her eyes. "Can you tell her you couldn't meet her today because you're going out with another woman?"Draco nodded. True. He can't tell that he would cancel because he's going to meet Astoria. And there's nothing wrong with it. It isn't cheating. He would just eat outside with a friend. He's sure Hermione would understand. "Alright".They both stood up and they were too close with one another. She glanced up at him and blushed. Draco gazed onto her green eyes. They weren't the same as Hermione's, but he wasn't pertaining to the color. Astoria's eyes were distant, cold, empty, just like his silver eyes. Astoria is like a female version of him. Both cold, ambitious and strong headed.Astoria leaned in closer and kissed his cheek. "I'll see you later." She turned her heel and left the office.Draco placed the palm of his hand to the place where she kissed him.What am I doing? I can't keep this up. I've known Astoria for a long time but she seems different now. I like the Astoria now. If only I knew she was that way before…then maybe…no. I'm still engaged to Hermione. But – what if I like Astoria more than her? Astoria and I have the same ambition. We had the same upbringing. We have a lot of things in common. With Hermione, I seemed distant. I don't feel the connection. She's warm and I'm too cold. She has this bright personality that I don't possess. I don't know if she would ever be happy with me. I think I should talk to Hermione…and…maybe…call off the engagement.oOoOoOoNEXT ON MY AMNESIA GIRL:"But we really have to tell you something important." Theo paused. He looked at Marcus who gestured him to go on. "Draco told me Astoria has the platinum bracelet.""I have to see Astoria." Hermione said more to herself. "Saturday… I'll see her on Saturday."oOoOoOoA/N: Please don't hate. It would get better soon. Review. I hate Astoria too. If you guys have questions why Draco is acting that way, think of it this way… He woke up, engaged to a woman he barely knew. Her stories about him seems OOC. A woman he knew for a long time shows up and tells him she knew him. She was born rich like him. A business woman who knew the old Draco… the workaholic-robot Draco. So who would he believe? Who would he choose to be with? He's confused.

A/N: Wrote this as soon as I finished 25. I hate to keep you guys waiting but my schedule seems to be getting hectic every minute. Review please. And I hope you won't stop reading this fic.Chapter 26Hermione checked her watch. It was almost five in the afternoon. She waited while the makeup artist retouched the model's makeup.Astoria stood beside her. "Sorry, I was on the phone with the event organizer." Hermione waved her hand. "No, it's okay, we're almost done. You could check the photos over there with Violet."Ginny came inside and she just finished taking pictures of other models. Ginny stood beside Hermione. "I could continue this shoot. You should go to Draco now." Hermione smiled gratefully ate her friend and gave her camera to Ginny. She was about to get her bag when Astoria called her. "Hermione, wait a second. Come over here."Hermione went to where Violet and Astoria stood. "Why? What's wrong?"Astoria pointed at the screen. "This isn't good. I can't see the design of the dress."Hermione looked closely. It looked fine with her. "Ginny. Come over here."Ginny waltzed to Hermione's side. "Why?"Astoria repeated what she noticed in the picture.Ginny narrowed her eyes on the screen. "It's good. I can see the design of the dress. It made it even better."Astoria shook her head. "No. It's not right. You should do it again, Hermione."Hermione cleared her throat. "I can't. I have to go somewhere."Astoria scoffed. "Hermione, I paid for your time today. Is this how you work? This is very unprofessional, leaving when you are clearly not yet finished."Hermione bit the inside of her cheeks. "You're right. I'll do it again."Ginny took Hermione's arm and stopped her. "No, I'll do it."Astoria stood. "Hermione did it, it was wrong, so she should fix it."Ginny took a step closer at Astoria. "I said I'll do it."Hermione stopped her friend. "No, I'll do it. I still have enough time.""But you have to meet Draco in a few minutes."Hermione looked at Astoria then at Ginny "I'll make it on time." Her phone began to ring. She saw it was Draco. She excused herself and went to the other end of the room. "Hey Draco. I think I would be late for a few minutes.""Hermione, I can't meet you today. I have another dinner meeting later. I'm sorry."Hermione felt her heart sunk. "Oh. That's okay.""But I'll see you tomorrow."She smiled. "Okay. Draco –""Yes?""I love you." She held her breath. She heard him gasp."Hermione.""I don't need an answer to that. I just want you to know that. See you tomorrow. Bye.""Herm-" She pressed the end button. She didn't want to hear anymore. This just isn't her day.She went back to where Ginny, Astoria and Violet were."I actually think this picture is great." Violet finally said.Astoria looked at her like she's gone mental. "What?""Astoria, it did emphasize the dress. Hermione did a great job."Ginny looked smugly at Astoria.Hermione held her hand up. "It's okay Violet, I could take more pictures then you guys could decide which you like."Ginny looked at her friend. "What happened?"Hermione whispered to Ginny and Ginny nodded.Astoria smirked. She knew that it was Draco who called her just a few minutes ago. He must've cancelled his meeting with her."Ginny could continue this shoot while I go back to the other model." Hermione took her camera back from Ginny.oOoOoOo"Oh. I have to go." Astoria checked her watch."What? But we aren't done here yet." Violet looked at her in disbelief."I have to talk to an important investor." Astoria took her bag."Bye Hermione, Ginny. I'll check the photos later." She waved goodbye.Ginny and Hermione waved back."Well, she could leave." Ginny said sarcastically."Of course she can. Right now, she's our boss." Hermione shrugged."I can smell something stinky." Ginny narrowed her eyes at the fleeting Astoria."I can too. It's the design of these dresses." Hermione giggled. Ginny followed suit.oOoOoOo"That's a wrap people." Hermione cheerfully announced and everyone clapped their hands. The models gave Hermione and Ginny a hug and so did Violet."I'm so sorry about Astoria. This is our biggest collection so she's feeling a little bit pressured right now." Violet said.Hermione waved her hand. "It's okay. We understand."Ginny and Hermione started to pack their equipment. "This was the most tiring shoot I've ever had." Ginny placed her camera back on the bag."I couldn't agree more." Hermione slung the camera bag on her shoulder. With the flick of her wand, all of their equipment was placed at their car."I have an idea." Ginny looked like she won the lottery."What?""Let's go out and eat in a fine restaurant.""What? No. I'm very tired Ginny." Hermione and Ginny started to walk back to the car."Oh, c'mon Hermione. You'll have the whole day tomorrow to rest." Ginny placed her arm on Hermione's shoulder. "My treat. Besides, Astoria gave us a huge check for the shoot today. What good is having that huge check and not treat ourselves in a fine restaurant?"Hermione glanced at her friend. "Oh alright. But we're so underdressed." She gestured at what they were wearing.Ginny waved her hands. "They won't mind…and they know I'm dating Harry Potter." She winked.oOoOoOo"Thank you for this night." Astoria placed her hand on top of his. They were in a small but elegant restaurant just around the corner."It was the best steak I've ever had." Draco smirked as he took a sip of his wine. "May I ask you something?"Astoria nodded for him to continue."How did I give you that bracelet?"Astoria bit her lip. "Well –" She paused. "You bought it for me when you were in Paris…in Swarovski. It was snowing and you immediately remembered me. This was your present for me for Christmas.""I see." Draco nodded. "Why now?""What?""Why did you come to me now? Hermione and I had a long break up. Why did you come to me now that I'm engaged?"She sighed and pulled her hand away from him. "It took me a long time to realize that I still love you. I was stupid not to fight for you."Draco took another sip. "Astoria, I'm engaged.""But you're not yet married." She interrupted him. "You could still call it off.""But Hermione… she'll get hurt.""You are hurting yourself.""I can't hurt Hermione."Astoria sighed. "Draco, you are not happy with her. How long could you put up with her? You always think of her happiness. What about yours?" She took a sip of her wine. "You're going to make things worse when you won't stop this. Stop deceiving yourself. I know you want me and I want you.""Astoria-" He began."I'll ask you this tonight. Right here. Right now. Me or Hermione?""I can't do this now." Draco looked away.Astoria stood and took Draco's hand. "Come here. I'll show you something."She led him to the terrace. He had a slight image coming out of his mind. They were dancing to a tune. He stopped for a minute. "Is there something wrong?" Astoria asked."N-nothing."Astoria looked at the labyrinth below. "This is such a beautiful place. Have you been here before?"Draco also looked at the labyrinth. "Yes. I've been here. You?"Astoria cocked her head to the side. "No. This is actually my first time. I didn't know this place existed."He frowned. What were the images he's seen a while ago?Astoria turned to face him. "Draco. I'm tired of telling you that I know you better than Hermione. You know me since we were children. We had a past but it didn't work out. But, I believe that this time, it's finally right. I know how much you love your job. I know that you treat your company like your own child. I know that you're not a romantic but I understand that. I know you always love giving extravagant gifts. I know that you don't like to be forced to do things you don't want to do. I know that you love spaghetti. I know that you like dining out in fine restaurants. I know that you love driving your car and hate the idea of riding a public transportation. " She took a step closer to him. "I know a lot about you and it would take the whole night to say it all." She took another step. "I love you Draco. I love you because you are perfect. I love you because you are business minded. You have goals. You are ambitious. You are good looking. You are intelligent. You are Draco Malfoy. How could I ask for more?" She wrapped her arms around him. She gazed into his eyes and pulled him closer. "I love you Draco." She planted her lips softly on his.His eyes grew wide but finally, he closed it slowly. She pulled him closer and he wrapped his arms around hers. Something at the back of his mind was telling me it was wrong. She felt like a stranger in his arms. He remembered the time Hermione kissed him at the hospital. He felt different that time. He felt like the huge barrier in his heart faded. He felt something strange in his heart that he never knew it was possible.This time, kissing Astoria, he felt like this isn't what he was used to. Her lips were soft but it wasn't as warm as Hermione's kissed. He didn't feel anything. Another image flashed through his mind. They were dancing then the woman walked away but he didn't go after her. He pulled away."I'm sorry. But I have to go." Draco pushed her away and turned. His eyes immediately grew wide when he realized they weren't the only one in the terrace."Hermione."Hermione looked like she's seen a Dementor. She found it hard to move, hard to speak, and hard to think. She wanted to check out the terrace where she and Draco danced before. She didn't expect him to be here, well maybe she did, but not kissing Astoria.Draco took a step closer. "Hermione."Hermione found herself walking backwards. She took a step backward, then another until she turned and ran far away as possible.Draco tried to run after her but Astoria took his arm. "Don't go after her Draco. Stay here, with me."He sighed in frustration and pried his arm away. "I have to go." He said without looking back at her.He apparated back to his flat.I definitely screwed everything up. Draco thought.oOoOoOoHermione was back on her flat. She called Ginny and told her everything and also told her not to mention anything to Harry and Ron. She doesn't want them to get involved with this…and she still cares enough for Draco. Merlin knows what Harry would do if he knew what she saw back in the restaurant.The image she saw just a few minutes ago was still plastered on her mind. Every time she thought of it, it just cut deeper to her much bruised heart.Now what? What should she do? Should she cry until her tears run out? Should she fight or should she let go?She was still sitting on the couch as she watched the glowing amber of flames in the fire place. She was holding her necklace and closed her eyes. She hoped this was all a bad dream and when she wakes up, Draco is back. Draco remembers her. Draco loves her again.She heard a knock on her door. She stood up slowly and opened the door."Draco?"Draco gestured if he could go inside and Hermione opened the door wider. He entered and started to pace. Hermione closed the door slowly and watched Draco. She wrapped her arms around her waist.Draco stopped and faced her. "I asked Blaise where you live. I drove my way here." He ran his hand through his hair. "I kissed Astoria."She bit her lip and looked away. "I don't need any reminder. That image was one memory I would never forget." Her eyes stung and she felt a lump form on her throat."I didn't say that to remind you." He began. "Hermione, I want to tell you the truth." He groaned in frustration. "I want to know you more, believe me, I do. But – I want to find myself first. I woke up, not remembering my fiancé. I don't know who that Draco Malfoy in your stories is. Do you know how frustrating it is? Please understand. I need time."Hermione was still looking down at the floor."Say something." Draco said in a soft voice.She bit her lip and cleared her throat. She tried to compose herself but every time she tried to open her mouth and say something, she felt that she was about to cry. She looked anywhere but him. She felt him took a step closer to her."Don't. Please." She whispered."Hermione.""Just tell me what you want." Hermione looked down on her hands."I don't know.""Do you want to call off the engagement?" She wiped her eyes quickly with the back of her hand before it roll down her cheeks.He looked stunned. "I – I don't know."She smiled sadly. "That question should just have a Yes or No answer. I could give you time Draco. If this is what you want. If this would truly make you happy, it's okay. Don't worry about me. Well, you showed me clearly how little you care about me. You were with Astoria-"Draco ran his hand through his hair. "Hermione, please understand. I was with Astoria because – Astoria knows me.""And I don't know you?" She asked in a soft voice but she was screaming inside."I mean. She knows who I really am… the way I know myself. You, on the other hand, know a different kind of me. I don't see myself doing the things you claim me doing. Astoria, she knows what I do. She knows how I work hard. She knows me. I am different now Hermione." He paused. "I could never be the same way I was before. I can't make you happy. It's time for us to let go… to move on.""You didn't even try." She whispered. "But, if that's what you want." She turned and opened the door.Draco studied her carefully. He wanted to say something but he was lost at words."You've said enough. Now, go." She was staring down at the floor.Draco took a few steps and stopped when he was in front of her. She didn't look back up."Go." She tried to take off the necklace but Draco stopped her. "No. I gave that to you. You should keep it."He took a few more steps. Hermione closed the door gently. Draco turned and looked down on the doorknob. He took hold of it but then decided to let her go. He was only hurting her. He was leading her on. He would never make her happy. With Astoria, he doesn't need to adjust with what he was doing."I'm sorry Hermione." He whispered.oOoOoOoHermione looked at her door. She cast a silencing spell at her flat. She started to cry. This was the second most hurtful thing Draco has ever done to her. The third was the kiss. She can't take it anymore. It hurts too much. She was too tired. She was tired physically and emotionally. Draco didn't even give her enough time. He didn't even try to get to know her.She looked at her necklace and cried some more. She lost him. She has truly lost him. This time, she doesn't know if she would ever have him back.She took her phone and dialed a number."Ginny." She sobbed."I'll be right over." Ginny said and in just a few seconds, she stepped out of the green flames in the fireplace.Ginny pulled Hermione to a hug."It's the end now, is it?" Hermione whispered.Ginny soothed her back. "No it isn't, it isn't the end until the love you feel for one another is gone."oOoOoOoThursday morning, Draco was still lying down on his bed in his flat. He had a terrible hangover from the five bottles of whiskey he drank the night before. He felt empty. He felt something heavy in his heart.He remembered all the things that happened the night before. Kissing Astoria, the images, breaking up with Hermione… He groaned at the last part. Never did he felt bad for breaking up with someone. He heard the door to his room slam open. "Good morning Draco." Theo greeted him cheerfully and opened the curtains.Draco groaned and threw a pillow to Theo. "The fuck Theo? Shut those bloody curtains. I have a terrible hangover."Theo sat at the edge of his bed and saw all the empty bottles on the floor. "Did you have a party last night that I wasn't invited to?"Draco dug his face under his other pillow. "No. I had a solo party last night."Theo tisked. "You should've invited me over. We could've had ten bottles. What happened?"Draco groaned some more. " Kissed Astoria. Hermione saw. Broke up with Hermione."Theo pulled the pillow out of his face. "Did I hear it correctly? You kissed Astoria? Hermione saw? You broke up with Hermione?""I'm glad your sense of hearing still works" Draco rolled his eyes and attempted to get his pillow back. Theo threw it across another room."Why did you break up with her?""I just can't do it alright?" He sat straight up. "I'm not the way I was before.""You're still a prick.""Sod off. Are you here to lecture me and tell me that I'm wrong?"Theo shrugged. "I don't need to tell that. I know that you know you're wrong.""I don't need your bloody opinion Theo. I don't need anyone's opinion. I broke up with her because I know it's the right thing to do. I'm leading her on. Now leave. I want to sleep."Theo was about to say something but then decided to leave it. He stood, turned on his heel but then turned back again. "What is with Astoria?"Draco glared at his friend then sighed. "She knows me Theo…don't give me that look…she knows the real me. How I run the company, how I hate leaving work. Hermione knows a different Draco. I don't know if that Draco would ever come back. With Astoria, I don't need to change. I gave her this bracelet, the one I've been seeing in my dreams. She even cooked me my favorite spaghetti and this cupcake."Theo held his hand up. "What? Bracelet? Astoria cooks? Since when?"Draco shrugged. "I don't know. I don't care. Now leave."oOoOoOoTheo gathered Blaise and Marcus on his flat. He called Hermione but she wasn't answering."We have to go to Hermione and tell her everything.""I'll go to Draco." Blaise offered.Theo and Marcus nodded.oOoOoOo"Is Hermione here?" Theo asked Elena and she shook her head. "I'm sorry but Hermione isn't feeling well today. Ginny is over there to take good care of her."Theo looked at Marcus. "Let's go."oOoOoOoGinny heard someone knock. She opened the door and saw Theo and Marcus. "What are you doing here?""We need to talk to Hermione." They walked past Ginny and looked around.Ginny rushed to stop them. "Okay. I'll call her. Wait there." She pointed to another direction.Marcus and Theo took a seat on the couch.Ginny went out first then Hermione followed. Her eyes were red and puffy and she has on her robes and blue yoga pants. Both of them took a seat across Theo and Marcus."What?" Hermione looked from one man to another. "Did he forget to tell something?"Theo shook his head. "I'm sorry Draco is such an asshole.""A huge asshole." Marcus added."But we really have to tell you something important." Theo paused. He looked at Marcus who gestured him to go on. "Draco told me Astoria has the platinum bracelet."Ginny scoffed. "I knew I smell something stinky."Hermione thought for a moment then remembered the time when Astoria offered a ride to her."There's more." Marcus said he nudged Theo to continue."Draco said Astoria also cooked him lunch."Ginny gasped and Hermione looked like a life was sucked out of her."I know." Theo snorted. "The first time I've heard it, I was flabbergasted."Hermione looked lost. Astoria lied to her and to Draco. She has to do something."I have to talk to Draco." Hermione began to stand when they heard someone enter the door."It's no use." Blaise closed the door gently. "Draco banned all of us to see him. I went to his flat but I got knocked off my feet when I was blocked by an invisible shield. I even tried his office but no use.""I have to see Astoria." Hermione said more to herself. "Saturday… I'll see her on Saturday."Ginny placed a hand on top of hers. Hermione glanced at Ginny. "I have to win Draco back."oOoOoOoNext on My Amnesia Girl:Hermione folded her arms. "I know you know what I'm talking about."Astoria turned to face her looking bored. "Oh, you want to talk about your ex fiancé?"A/N: Things will get better. I promise. And when things get better, it means it's coming to an end. Please review. Thank you all! Chapter 27 is done.





--------




A/N: I've been writing for three days straight, each for every chapter. Thank you for the lovely reviews. Each of you has their own opinions about this fic. And it's okay. Really. I had to change Chapter 26 to fit this chapter. Please review again. Since I may not be able to post as soon as possible, I would make this chapter longer than expected. Btw, it always amazes me when a certain reader could read my mind. Haha! Btw, please listen to the music I placed there while reading that part. Hihi.Chapter 27Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. He was having a rough Friday morning. His friends tried to call him, tried to pass security in his office and tried to remove the barrier from his flat. Right now, he was very disappointed with them. They are his friends. They should support him and not force him to be with someone he doesn't have any feelings for. They should understand how confused he is right now.They knew Astoria. What is wrong with getting involved with her?He looked at his cell phone. It's fully charged but he hasn't opened it yet. He pressed the power button to boot up his phone. He waited for a while.A series of emails and messages popped up from his call. He checked each one and it was all about the sales reports, investments, and the like. He scrolled down some more and saw old messages from Hermione. He didn't read it. He doesn't know if he is ready. He checked the missed calls and noticed the outgoing call. The last person he called when he had his accident was Hermione.He placed his phone down. He didn't want to see anything anymore.oOoOoOoThe day seemed too long and Draco hasn't heard anything from Astoria. He was about to head home, taking a few steps down the stairs from his building when he heard someone call him.He turned his head and saw Hermione. His heart stopped, he doesn't know if it is seeing her after he broke up with her or the fact that she's here, at this moment beaming at him.Hermione stood in front of him. "Hi."Draco smirked. "Hi.""Can I talk to you?"He shrugged. "Sure." He was about to lead her inside the building but she placed her hand up. "No, not here. Let's take a walk to the park.""A walk?" He wasn't sure if he heard correctly."Yeah. It's just around the corner." She waved her hand gesturing him to come along. "Let's go. The weather is great."They walked in silence. Draco peered sideways to see what she was doing. Hermione peered at the same time and they both smiled sheepishly.Try to say something Draco. He thought. They turned to right and saw the park at the end. He didn't know there was a park near his office."How are you?" He asked and immediately regretted his first question.She gave a small smile. "I honestly don't know how to answer that question yet.""That was a wrong question." He admitted. "I'm sorry."She waved a hand dismissively.They entered the gates of the park and took a seat at one of the empty iron benches.Hermione took a deep breath and exhaled softly. "It's such lovely day isn't it? It's perfect to stay here at this time of the day. Silence surrounds you and the only sound you could hear is the rattling of the leaves of the trees and you could smell the fresh flowers." Draco couldn't help but watch her amazed look at this small park."Hermione…" He whispered.She glanced to face him. "I'm still hurt Draco. I'm crushed inside. But I still want you in my life…Just hear me out first." She said quickly before he could say anything else. "I want to be your friend. I know it's the most stupid idea and it would only hurt me more, but it's better than being complete strangers again."He nodded. He liked the idea. He could get to know more about Hermione without any commitment. They could be formal with one another without any awkward moments, without him holding back or even changing the way he is right now. "I'm fine with that. But, I'm really sorry Hermione. I'm sorry for hurting you."She smiled sadly. "I'm sorry too." She sighed out loud and sat up straight. "Are you hungry?"Draco smirked. "Yeah. Where do you want to eat? If you want, I know a great French Restaurant-"She shook her head immediately. "No. I prepared something for you."He arched his brow. "Really?"She grinned and nodded. She stood up and offered her hand. He hesitated for a moment but finally placed his hand on hers. An electric jolt passed through his veins. He gasped. Hermione felt it too but she didn't show it. She led him deeper to the park near the pond. Dusk was fast approaching and the sky was a mixture of orange, pink and blue.Hermione stopped and let go of his hand. She waved her hands to a blanket which was placed on the grass with a huge basket in the middle. "Ta da!"He smirked. "Wow. I didn't know we have a reservation here."She playfully rolled her eyes and took his hands again. "Sit." He looked around and noticed there aren't any chairs to sit on.Hermione took a seat on the blanket and saw that he still wasn't sitting. She transfigured a white tulip to a pillow. She offered it to Draco and gestured him to sit down. He sat down and found it quite comfortable than he expected.She opened the basket and took out all the food she prepared. There was spaghetti and meatballs, two baguettes, salmon salad sandwiches, sweet potato salad with buttermilk dressing, and zucchini carpaccio."You made all of this?" He asked. She nodded.She placed a fair amount of food on his plate and handed it to him. She paced her own food on her plate.Draco took his first bite of spaghetti. It tasted the same as what Astoria made but only better. He can't figure out what was the difference.Eating here in the park felt great. It was better than eating at a fine dining restaurant. You don't need to be too formal. You don't need musical instruments to hear music. He looked around. He can't remember the last time he felt this calm and happy."Draco." Hermione muttered.He turned to face her. She reached out to him and placed her finger at the corner of his lips. She wiped off the sauce. She placed her finger back to her mouth to clean it off. He remembered she did the same thing back in the hospital. He smirked and noticed she has sauce on her cheek. He laughed and copied her actions as he wiped the sauce off. "You are such a messy eater. " He said and placed his finger on his mouth.Hermione grinned. "That's the joy of eating spaghetti."oOoOoOoSaving Forever For You - NinaThey continued eating and when they were full, Hermione started to clean their place with a flick of her wand. "Scourgify." She placed a contented smile and saw that there isn't a hint of mess from where they ate. The basket disappeared as well. Draco watched her intently. The sun's rays and the color of the sky reflected well on Hermione's hair. It was as if she had a halo around her head. "What?" She asked.He transfigured the pillow back to a tulip. He cleared his throat and handed the tulip to her. "You made dinner, now I'll treat you for dessert."Hermione giggled and accepted the tulip. "I also prepared dessert." She took his hand and they ran outside the park to the pavement. Draco watched her as she glanced at him from time to time. She stopped and led him to the back of a bakery. She opened the door and the pastry chef, who was an old man with his glasses and wearing a white chef uniform, greeted her. "Hi, Hermione. Take care of my kitchen, alright?" Hermione nodded.Draco gave a short nod to the pastry chef and they were left all alone."Kitchen? We will eat in the kitchen?" Draco asked. Hermione shook her head. "All the pastries Chef George made was sold now. We would be making our own dessert." She winked at him.Draco never made his own dessert. He only knew how to buy or order them. This would be the first time he would do this…and he was nervous.Hermione placed the tulip he gave her inside her bag. She washed her hands and so did Draco. They placed on their aprons. With a flick of her wand, all the tools and ingredients they needed were laid on the table before them. She flicked her wand again to preheat the oven.Hermione took the large bowl and started to sift the flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa powder. Draco watched her. She looked up at him. "You have to beat the butter in the electric mixer."Draco nodded and stared at the table. Hermione couldn't help but laugh. She took Draco's hand and showed him the electric mixer. She placed the butter on the bowl and then showed Draco how to operate the mixer. She could see how amazed he was."Okay, just tell me what to put next. I could handle it now." He grinned. She told him what to do after and they worked on their own task.Hermione started to mix the buttermilk with a red food coloring. Then she mixed it with the flour mixture and the butter mixture. Draco mixed the vinegar and baking soda and they quickly fold into the cake batter.Draco took an attempt to taste the batter but Hermione gently slapped his hand away. He laughed and dipped his finger on the batter. Hermione gasped. He laughed harder.Hermione directed Draco to divide the batter evenly among the twelve muffin cups. Draco placed the tray on the oven and they continued making the frosting.Draco took in charge with the electric mixer while Hermione placed the ingredients. Hermione dipped her finger to the frosting and tasted it, nodding in satisfaction. Draco tasted it too and then dipped his finger again and placed it on Hermione's cheek. "Oh no you did not just do that." Hermione gasped.He whistled and pretended he has no idea what she was saying. Hermione took a handful of flour and threw it on his face. Draco's eyes grew wide. "This is a very expensive coat."Hermione winced. "Sorry. Let me get my wand." Draco took her arm and poured the excess batter to her head. "I was just kidding." He grinned.They threw all the ingredients to one another. Hermione even managed to throw an egg to his head. "Just a little more baking soda Draco and I could bake you inside the oven.""Only if I bake you first." Draco struggled to run to her direction because the floor was covered in eggs, flour, and buttermilk. Hermione screamed and carefully ran to the other end of the kitchen. "Chef George would kill us if he sees all this mess." She laughed.Draco continued to chase after her when an image of him reaching out to something flashed before his eyes. He slipped and landed on his back. Hermione stopped and rushed over to him. She knelt beside him and placed her hand on his face. "Are you alright Draco?"He nodded and sat back up. Their faces were too close to one another. She blushed and so did he. His eyes darted down to her rosy pink lips and he started to lean closer to her. Their lips almost touched when they heard the oven ring. "The cupcakes are ready." Hermione said in a strangled voice. Draco nodded and tried to stand. He helped Hermione up and she fleet her way to the oven.Draco took his wand out and cleaned the kitchen."We have to cool this down first." Hermione said. "We could make some fondant, if you want." He nodded avoiding eye contact with her.Hermione took out small balls of fondant, each of different color. "You could make anything you want. You should flatten it out first, like this, and then you could cut them out or something."She started to make Draco's face. He noticed that it was the same design as Astoria made. "Have you been doing this for a long time?" He can't help but ask.She nodded. "My mother taught me how to bake. Chef George was a good friend of my mother who also taught me how to do other pastries." She started to paint his eyes on the fondant. "Can you please check if the cupcake is ready for frosting?"Draco nodded and checked the cupcakes. "I think it's ready now." Hermione brushed her hands and handed him his own piping bag with a round tip. Hermione brushed her hair to the side. "This is how you frost a cupcake." She started with the middle and slowly and carefully swirled it until the cupcake was frosted completely. "There. At first you'll find it difficult but with a little patience, you'll get used to it. Now, it's your turn." She waved for him to start frosting. He failed the first time, and the second until he got it right, sort of, on the third. He looked proudly at his third cupcake.Hermione took their frosted cupcakes and placed them near the cut out fondants they made. She placed the little face of Draco on top of the icing. She glanced at him. "What design did you do?" He showed him his cupcake with her face. "It's beautiful…and you got my hair right." She smiled and handed him her cupcake, he handed his cupcake. Draco took his first bite. "Hmm. This is good. I taste good." He pointed at the fondant Draco.She nodded in agreement. "It tastes good because you worked hard for it.""You bet I did. I think I should consider opening up a pastry shop. You'll be the chef." He smirked.She scoffed. "I'm sorry to say this, but I decline. I have a studio to manage." She giggled. "But if you want any dessert, I could make one for you. Just ask me anytime.""Really?""Really.""Why?"Because I love you. "Because that's what friends do." She forced a smile.He smiled back and finally cleaned the kitchen. "Thanks for dinner and dessert. It was the most interesting experience for me.""I'm glad to hear that." She offered her hand again. He looked down on it and placed his hand on hers. Hermione thought he would give her a handshake but was surprised when he pulled her into his arms. Her eyes begin to fill again with tears. "Thank you." He whispered to her ear.She wrapped her arms around his. She can't speak. If she did, she will cry.She doesn't care if for now, she's only a friend to him. She would show him that she would always be there for him no matter what happens. This way, he could get to know her more and maybe, someday, he would fall in love with her again. She would rather spend time with him this way than to never spend time with him forever.oOoOoOoWho do you tell? – TamiaHermione and Draco walked side by side. She glanced to her side and saw him smiling. "Your smile is like expelliarmus." She said.He smirked. "What? Why?"She giggled. "It's simple but disarming.""Ahh." He nodded. "You know some pickup lines. Well, I know one…" He thought for a minute. "Okay, here… Are you a golden snitch?""Why?""Because I've been seeking for something like you my whole life."She gave a forceful smile. If she were to be honest, she wanted to cry and wrap her arms around him and tell him she loves him so much but it might scare him away."That was a good one. But seriously, why are you smiling?"He turned to face her and smiled widely. "Because…" He sighed. "I never thought I would walk in the streets of London using my very expensive Italian Shoes."She laughed. "I once walked barefoot because I didn't want to ruin my shoes."He raised his brow. "You would do that for a pair of shoes?"She nodded and looked down at the pavement."Why would you do that?" He can't help but ask.She cocked her head to the side. "Because it was a gift for me for loving someone each and every day."He smirked. He could see in her eyes how fond she was of that memory. A flash of image appeared once again through his mind. He saw himself skipping from one puddle to another."Hey, I have one last surprise for you. But you have to keep your eyes closed." She placed a handkerchief and blindfolded him.After a few minutes, she took of his blindfold. "Now open your eyes."He squinted for a while at the sudden brightness and when his vision adjusted, he realized they were standing in front of the London Eye."Apparition?"She shook her head. "It's a secret spell Professor McGonagall taught me. Let's go."They rode one car of the London Eye. He could see her hands trembling. "You're afraid of heights?"She shrugged. "A little."He continued to look at her.She sighed. "Okay, I'm afraid of heights."He grinned and took her hand. "It's okay, I'm here."She couldn't help the tears forming in her eyes. She remembered the time he proposed to her the second time. She felt him grip his hands tighter. She looked down on their clasped hands and looked up back at him. She could see him looking afar, deep in thought.He could see flashing images coming out of his mind. Seeing the view seems familiar. It was like a dream, a déjà vu rather, but he can't figure out if it did happen or not. He blinked a few times and saw Hermione looking at him. The light of the London Eye reflected beautifully on her skin. She didn't have any makeup on but she really looks beautiful. Butterflies started to flutter on his stomach. He frowned. He never felt like this just by looking at a woman. But it's not just any woman. He could hear something from the back of his mind say. He looked away."I would never forget this day." He announced."Here." Hermione took a magical thread from her pocket. She slowly tied it on Draco's ring finger. "Someone once told me that he always forget things when he was a kid. His mother would tie a thread on his finger so that every time he sees it, he would remember what she told him." She slowly knotted it into a ribbon. "Whenever you see this, Draco, you would always remember this day."He felt a huge lump on his throat. His mother used to do the same thing whenever he forgets something. While Hermione knotted the thread on his finger, a flashing image appeared once more in his mind.Hermione peered up to him. "There." The thread formed into a silver ring."Hermione –" Draco began."Yes?""I think –" He was cut off when the door to their car opened."Let's go." Hermione offered her hand and he took it."I should bring you home." Draco offered. "It's late."She shrugged. "No. It's okay. I could go home by myself.""Are you sure? It isn't safe.""I could handle myself Draco. Don't you worry."He took her hands and brought it up his lips. "Thank you. I mean it. Thank you for this day."She gave a small smile. "Thank you too."He frowned. "For what?""For this day." And for giving me a chance.He smiled and let her hands go. "I'm looking forward to another day Miss Granger."She gave a short nod and laughed. "I might as well plan for our next hangout.""Very well." He smirked. "Good bye Hermione. Take Care.""Good bye Draco." She waved her hand and turned her heels and started to walk away.He stretched his arm out and was about to call her again when another image of him reaching out to something flashed through his mind. He winced at the sudden pain that jolted to his brain. He saw image after image and then it began to disappear.What was that?oOoOoOoBack at Draco's flat, he took a shower and placed on his pyjamas. He dried his hair with his towel when he noticed a box at the corner of his room. He remembered it was the 'evidence' box of Hermione. He opened it but then closed it again. Is he ready to look at it? He opened it again and took the photo album. There were pictures of him and Hermione together. They were in a birthday party. The banner says it was Hermione's eleventh birthday and there were Hogwarts acceptance letter's flying around. He could see Hermione smiling as an acceptance letter landed on her lap. He couldn't help but smile.There was another picture of them waving at the camera and they started to kiss. He remembered how those lips felt on his. Would he ever feel those lips again? He shook his head.He flipped the page and saw a photo of him. On the side it says 'I asked Hermione to take a picture of me so I could give it to my girlfriend. But I didn't give it to my girlfriend… I gave it to Hermione Jean Granger...my fiancée. He flipped the page again and they were playing in the snow. He narrowed his eyes and saw that she was wearing a bracelet. He frowned and closed the album and he put it on the side.He saw a box there was a note on top. 'Reasons why Draco Malfoy loves me' He opened the box and saw several post its. He smirked. He can't believe he pulled this thing off.He saw another book. He opened it and each pages has a dried, different colored tulips. The last page has a white tulip with a description 'Draco hasn't forgotten my favorite color and flower.' He remembered the tulip he gave her today.There were other things inside but he decided to check it in another time. These things were very unfamiliar to him but it didn't feel wrong either. Looking at those pictures, he looked happy, care free and contented, not like the old him who never had the time to even look at the small park around the corner.He groaned in frustration. This time, in a very long time, he has to admit that he might be wrong. Maybe he has some kind of feelings for Hermione. But what kind of feelings?He closed his eyes briefly and saw another image of him looking at the London Eye under the night sky but it didn't happen today. It seems like he was flying his broom, but he wasn't alone.oOoOoOoIt was Saturday morning and Hermione went to the Greengrass Hotel Grand Ballroom earlier than she should be. Ginny offered to come along with her but she refused. She should handle this on her own. This is between her and Astoria.She looked around and immediately saw Astoria talking to Violet while looking at the models practicing for their ramp later.She took long strides to where Astoria stood. "Astoria."Astoria glanced at her and smirked. "Hermione." She excused herself to Violet and led Hermione to a secluded area."You're earlier than I expected you to be." Astoria pretended to check the dresses hanging on the rack."Actually, I'm late." Hermione said."Really? Late for what? Are you expected to go somewhere else?""Here's a funny story, I cast a spell to lead me where the lying slutty bitch is and look… I'm standing right in front of you." Hermione folded her arms. "I know you know what I'm talking about."Astoria turned to face her looking bored. "Oh, you want to talk about your ex fiancé?"Hermione dropped her hands. "How did you know that?""I have my sources." She answered in her cold voice."You lied to him, pretending to know and understand him." Hermione snarled.Astoria raised her brow and leaned on the desk. "I do know and understand him.""Really? Cause I beg to differ." Hermione sneered.Astoria took a step closer. "Oh please. He doesn't know you. If you weren't there in the hospital, he would never even know you existed. I, on the other hand, was always in his memory. He may be not the Draco you used to know, but who cares? He would never change back to his old self. He would want to be with me because he's more comfortable with me than with you." She took another step closer. Hermione took her wand out."Alright, if this is what you want." Astoria took out her wand as well. "But may I remind you that I've perfected the DADA during my study in Hogwarts. I don't want to hurt your pretty little face."Hermione smirked. "Maybe you're forgetting one little detail… I'm the Brightest Witch of Our Age, bitch. Everte Startum" With a flick of her wand she casted Astoria across the other side of the room.Astoria tried to stand back up and raised her wand. "Fumos." The room started to fill with gray smoke. Hermione tried to find Astoria when a shoot of light flashed through her. "Flipendo." Hermione was knocked back across the other end of the room and hit her back to the door."Finite" She flicked her wand and cleared the room and saw that Astoria was about to cast another spell. Hermione raised her hand quick. "Expelliarmus."Astoria gave out a menacing smile. "Alright. I've expected that to happen."Hermione placed her wand back inside her pocket and smirked. "So did you expect this?" She strutted to where Astoria stood and slapped her hard on the face. "That's for lying to Draco". Astoria's eyes grew wide and accioed her wand, but Hermione took it away from her grasp. "With or without magic, I would still win Astoria." She slapped the other side of Astoria's cheek. "That's for me. Now tell Draco the truth and leave us alone. You're confusing him already."Astoria let out an evil laugh and took her wand from Hermione. She placed it back on her pocket and fixed herself and rubbed her hand to the new stinging cheek. "Don't you get it? He isn't happy with you. You want to bet?" She winced as she placed her hand on her cheek. "I won't be hiring you as the official photographer for this event. I want you as a guest so you could witness first hand that I am right and you're too delusional to believe that he's just not that into you anymore."Hermione gritted her teeth. "You'll lose."Astoria leaned closely. "I doubt that." She took a step to the right and they were side by side. She looked at Hermione from head to toe. "I still can't see what he liked about you."Hermione glanced back at her. "I know why he never liked you."Astoria pursed her lips and strutted her way out of the room. "Just make sure you're ready to get your heart crushed later."oOoOoOoDraco was in his office. He wanted everything finished before he goes to Astoria's fashion launch. He remembered the day he had with Hermione and can't stop grinning from ear to ear. There was a buzz on his phone."Sir, there is a Ben Milner who wanted to see you."He frowned. He doesn't know any Ben Milner. It might be a new investor. He pressed the button. "Alright. Send him to the conference room. I'll be there in a few minutes."He straightened his coat out and darted towards the conference room. He opened the door expecting a man who was wearing expensive coat and black slacks that has a big Rolex on his wrist, but he was wrong. He saw a man wearing dark blue jeans and white shirt. He stood up and held out his hand. "It's so good to see you Sir Draco Malfoy. You look great."Draco shook his hand "May I know who you are?"The man dropped his hand and then looked like he remembered something. "Oh, I've heard about your memory loss. I'm Ben. I helped you when you had your accident."A/N: I was wrong. Chapter 9 was my longest chapter yet. Please check chapter 4 to remember what Hermione was talking about (the shoe part) and also the magic thread. I hope you like this one. Thank you for the reviews! I didn't put what's next cause I'm just half way through chapter 28.

A/N: Wrote this as soon as I finished chapter 27. I was too inspired to write, however I had a terrible migraine. My doctor told me to stay away from my laptop for a few days and rest. BUT, I can't control myself because I wanted to finish this fic. Also, may I add, I'm working on my thesis. Anyway, thank you for the reviews and for those who added this in their favorite list. Please review again. BEWARE that Draco would be annoying in this chapter. He has to be. I'm almost at the end of My Amnesia Girl due to longer chapters I'm posting.Previously on My Amnesia Girl…Draco shook his hand "May I know who you are?" The man dropped his hand and then looked like he remembered something. "Oh, I've heard about your memory loss. I'm Ben. I helped you when you had your accident."Chapter 28"Ben." Draco repeated. "I'm sorry if I don't remember you, but please, take a seat." He motioned to the seat Ben was previously occupying.Ben took a seat and so did Draco. "So how may I help you?" Draco asked."I just wanted to see if you are all right. I wasn't able to visit you during your stay at the hospital because I had to bring my wife, Linda, home to our children. My son's wife gave birth to a healthy baby girl.""Congratulations." Draco smirked."Thank you." Ben murmured."I should be the one thanking you, Ben. If it wasn't for you, I would never be here where I am today."Ben smiled, showing off the small wrinkles at the corner of his eyes. "It's good to see you well and you had a fast recovery too. I was quite surprised when I went to the hospital and they said you were discharged already.""I was lucky, I guess." Draco shrugged and shifted from his seat. "Could you -" He paused. "Do you happen to remember what happened?" He really wanted to know what happened. He can't remember anything from the accident. He wanted answers and now here's a man who could tell him everything.Ben cleared his throat and rested his arms on top of the table. "I guess I could try. Let's see." He thought for a moment. "It all happened so fast, you were driving through the intersection when the other car beat the red light. Your car kept rolling over and over until it finally stopped. Your car was upside down."Draco frowned as some images began to flash again through his mind."My wife and I were too shocked that we rushed out to your car. I saw you bathing in your own blood and there were glasses shattered." Ben's face looked like he's seen a ghost. "I thought we lost you that moment. I told Linda to call emergency." He narrowed his eyes as he tried to remember what happened. "I think you tried to speak."Draco raised his brow. "What did I say?"Ben shrugged. "I can't understand… but you kept trying to tell me something and reach your phone."The image flashed once again in Draco's mind. He kept dreaming that he was reaching on to something or someone. Could this be what he was reaching for? He winced once more as a sudden pain flashed through his brain."Are you alright Draco?" Ben placed a hand on his shoulder.Draco nodded. "Yeah. I just have a headache.""I guess you better rest. We could just talk about this another time." Ben started to stand but Draco stopped him when he placed his hand on Ben's arm."Please, tell me more."Ben was hesitant at first but finally nodded. "You tried to reach your phone, but I told you to stop and I took your phone." As words came out from Ben, Draco saw another image on his mind. He winced once more from the pain shooting from his head.Ben placed his hand on Draco's shoulder. "Are you okay? We should just continue this another time."This time, Draco nodded. A thin blanket of sweat started to cover his forehead. He tried to stand but Ben stopped him. "You should sit down for a minute. I could walk myself out." He gave a reassuring smile. "It's nice to see you again, Draco." Ben gave Draco a pat on the back."Thank you again. If you don't mind, but could you please give your contact number to my assistant. I would really like to get more answers from you soon. Oh, and please thank Linda for me too."Ben nodded and left.oOoOoOoDraco was seating in a small bistro taking a sip of his wine. He checked his watch and when he looked up Astoria was strutting to his way. "I'm sorry I'm late." Draco stood up and Astoria gave him a peck on his cheek."It's okay. I've just arrived a few minutes ago." Draco smirked and pulled out a chair for her. Astoria muttered her thanks. She brushed her hair on one side of her shoulder. He noticed that her cheeks were swelling."What happened to your cheeks?"Astoria sighed. "Do you really want to know?" He nodded."Hermione did this to me." She whispered forcing some tears on her eyes."What? That's not possible." He sputtered.She scoffed. "Who else do you think would do this to me?""I'm sorry but I really find it impossible Astoria.""Believe me, she did this. She even did this to you during your third year in Hogwarts." She hissed. "Ask Violet if you have to.""She did it to me?" He looked surprised but then thought for a minute. "I'm pretty sure she has a good reason for slapping me before and maybe she has a reason now." He waved towards her.Astoria looked at him in disbelief. "Are you saying I deserve this?" She pointed at her face tears started to form in her eyes. "I can't believe you're saying this. I can't believe you're defending her.""I'm not defending her. I just find it impossible. I spent the day with her yesterday –"She gasped. "You were with her yesterday?""Well yeah-""And you think you know her already for just a single day?" She leaned back to her chair.He gaped. He was lost at words."She did this to me because she was jealous of me…of us." She took her handkerchief inside her clutched and looked away wiping the tears on her eyes."Astoria-""She attacked me in the ballroom and said awful things not only about me but about you." She sobbed."What did she say?" He whispered."She said that I was too delusional to even think you would like me. She said that she could lure men like you to like her. She even tried to make a bet with me that she'll win you over. She would pretend to know you and let you spend time with her and show you that you're having a good time. But it's all a lie. She's lying to you Draco. She's lying to us." She paused. "Think about it, all your friends treat me as if I'm a pain in the arse. They tell Hermione everything about you, what you like, what you do. This is so unfair."Draco frowned. He can't imagine Hermione saying or doing those things. But, he doesn't know her that well yet. He only got to spend a day with her and it isn't enough to know someone."I can't believe I even hired her. She saw me preparing the food I brought you and even tried to steal the bracelet you gave me." She bit out."What?" That got his attention.Astoria gave a menacing laugh. "You don't know? I hired her as my photographer last Wednesday. I was talking to Violet about this meal I made for you and even showed her these cupcakes I made. Why?" Her green eyes had a wicked gleam. "She pulled the same thing to you yesterday, did she?"He clenched his jaw. Everything that happened yesterday, the same spaghetti, the same cupcakes…it was all because Hermione copied it from Astoria. What was she trying to do? He can't believe he fell for that.Astoria couldn't hide the satisfaction she felt as she watched the expression on Draco's face. This was brilliant. Everything is falling right into her own hand."I invited her though, to the fashion launch."He turned his gaze back to her. "Why would you do that?"She placed her hand on top of his. "So we could prove her wrong, love. Draco, you should erase that girl in your mind."He sighed in anger and with the determined look on his eyes he nodded. "You're right. I will erase her in my mind and forget about her."Astoria smirked. "Good. Now that's been settled, let's order our food and talk about other things."She's right. They should talk about other things. He would deal about Hermione later. "So, I met this man-" Draco began.Astoria held her hand up. "Could we just eat first? I've got to go and get ready for the launch."Draco nodded and raised his hand. "I ordered for us already.""Okay." Astoria smiled sweetly at him.The waiter came and gave them a plate of spaghetti. Astoria made a face. "Spaghetti?"Draco nodded. "You made one for me last time, right? I know it wouldn't compare to what you made but we should give this a try." He helped her swirl the spaghetti on her fork. "There. Now eat."Astoria sighed and took a bite of the spaghetti. Draco smirked. "It's good, isn't it?"Astoria chewed the spaghetti slowly and pretended to like it. She looked at him and noticed he has a sauce on his lip. "Draco." She pointed at her lip. "You have a sauce on your lip."He held his hand up to the corner of his lip. She handed him a table napkin. "Here." He took the napkin from her grasp and wiped his mouth. He glanced up and saw a sauce on her lip. He smiled and was about to wipe it with his finger when Astoria leaned back, placing her hands before her. "What are you doing?"Draco stopped and pointed at her lips. "You also have a sauce there."She immediately took another table napkin and wiped her lips. "This is why I hate spaghetti. It's messy."He frowned. "But you cooked spaghetti for me. How could you even make one if you hated it?"She plastered on a fake smile. "Love, it is possible to cook something for your special someone." She raised her hand to call a waiter. "Salad please. No eggs."Draco continued eating his spaghetti. He remembered what happened yesterday. It's disappointing that Hermione isn't who he thinks she is. But, even though Hermione only copied Astoria, he has to admit, he had a great time. A smile began to form in his lips.The waiter arrived and placed down the salad Astoria ordered. She sighed. "Finally, something I can eat." She glanced up at him. "Why are you smiling?"He darted his eyes to her. "I just remembered something." He took another bite of his spaghetti. "You didn't call yesterday."Astoria looked at him like he's gone mental. "I am stressing out at the final preparation for my fashion launch. I thought you knew that."He held his hand up. "Okay, you don't need to get all fussy about it."She sighed. "I'm sorry. I'm just really stressed out."Draco took her hand. "It would be great, I promise."She smiled at him gratefully."Your smile is like expelliarmus." He said.She raised her brow. "What? Why?""It's simple but disarming." He smirked.Astoria made another face. "Really? Pickup lines? What's up with you today Draco?" She pulled her hand away.Draco sat up straight and took a sip of his wine. "I just heard it from someone."She was about to say something when her phone rang. "Excuse me."Draco continued eating his spaghetti. He watched Astoria talking to someone on the phone. She is really different from Hermione. Is this the woman that he really wants to be with? Is this really him? Is he happy?Astoria placed her phone down. "It was Violet. A model stepped on one of the dresses and it got ripped but everything is under control."He nodded. He wanted to tell her about Ben but he knew it wouldn't catch her interest. "Mr. Heindrichs told me that branching out to America could bring huge success for my company."She shot back at him and wiped her mouth with her napkin. "That's brilliant. When are you planning to go to America?"He shrugged and poked on his food. "I don't know if I want to do it. I just can't leave London."She rolled her eyes. "This is a big opportunity for you Draco. Just think about it. And –" her eyes lit up. "I could also open a new boutique there." She clasped her hands. "Oh please reconsider it?" She pouted and gave him her puppy dog eyes.He smirked. "Alright. I'll have a meeting again with Heindrichs on Monday."She clapped her hands and ate her salad happily.oOoOoOoWhen they finished their meal Draco called out to the waiter. "What dessert do you want?""I have to go. There's a problem over the ballroom." She said without looking up. She was busy again with her phone.Draco gave his credit card to the waiter. Astoria was now talking to Violet on the phone. He looked at the ring he was wearing. It was the ring Hermione gave him. "What's that?" Astoria asked."Oh. It's – it's a gift.""From who?""A friend."She shrugged like it was no big deal and went back to her phone.The waiter came back, handing Draco's credit card. Draco left a huge tip on the table and stood. Astoria trailed behind him."I'll see you later?"Draco nodded. "See you."Astoria's car arrived and without another glance, she went inside and her car drove off."Bye." Draco said sarcastically and turned his heel. He felt like walking back to his office. He checked his watch. He has enough time to prepare for the launch. He began to walk and sighed. Walking in the streets of London isn't bad after all.oOoOoOoThe Grand Ballroom of the Greengrass Hotel was truly amazing. The event organizer placed too much effort in it that everything seems perfect. The ballroom has the same theme with the photo shoot – romantic, sophisticated with that medieval times vibe. On the background was the picture of the castle where they had their shoot. The ramp had its stone floors with rose petals scattered on it. The light also changes in cue with the music. Famous designers, celebrities, models and other distinguished guests began to sit down on their own respective chairs.Hermione looked around. Her hair had stylish soft waves which reached her back. She was wearing a black short figure-fitting lace dress with a stand up collar and concealed button at the back of the neck. On her feet were red pumps. Ginny helped her with her makeup. Nothing too drastic, but just enough to pop her eyes out. Ginny was also looking around. She was wearing a short, plum gently flared dress in jersey crepe with narrow shoulder straps, which has a frill on the top and overlock seams. She had on nude stilettos and her hair was in a messy bun.Draco wasn't there yet but Hermione saw that his chair was beside Astoria's. Usually, the designer would be at the backstage but Hermione knew well that Astoria would be watching the fashion show so Astoria could keep eye on her. She and Ginny's chair were at the far back on the other side of the ramp but obviously it was planned as well because they have a clear view on Astoria and Draco's seat."Where are they?" Ginny whispered to her ear. Hermione shrugged. Just then, Draco and Astoria came. Draco was in his usual black coat with crisp gray shirt, which was unbuttoned on top and black slacks. He was really handsome with his messy hair. She saw women giggling and batting their eyelashes at him. Astoria looked beautiful also with her straight hair touching her back. She was wearing emerald silk dress that reaches the floor. She has on some gold cuffs on her left wrist and the bracelet of Hermione on her right. It is pretty obvious that they are the star of the night. They look good together. They match each other. They are both from rich families and had the same upbringing.Hermione can't help but feel her heart clench. Both her feet and hands started to feel cold. Draco began to whisper something to Astoria and she smiled.Ginny glanced at her friend. "Do you want to go?" Hermione shook her head. "I need to talk to Draco later."The fashion show started. Models started to walk through the runway. There were applause and gasps from the audiences. Hermione wasn't paying attention to the dresses though. She was watching Draco and Astoria.She saw Astoria take Draco's hand. Astoria's lips formed a sly smile and she took a quick glance at Hermione. Hermione pursed her lips and held her gaze at Astoria. She tried to mutter a small hex but then figured that Astoria made a shield from her hexes.The fashion show ended and Violet walked to the ramp and was later joined by Astoria. There was a standing ovation from the audiences. Hermione started to move and go to Draco's direction when he went up to the ramp and gave Astoria a bouquet of white tulips. He gave a quick kiss at her cheek and Astoria started to whisper at his ear. He frowned a little but smiled as the photographer took a picture of them.Hermione felt she couldn't move, her eyes fixed on them. She wasn't sure if Ginny was the one calling out to her. It's like she couldn't hear anything and the sight before her was in slow motion."Astoria and Draco really belongs to one another." A woman said to another woman who was standing in front of Hermione.Hermione took a step back and excused herself to Ginny. "I'm going to the loo.""Do you want me to come with you?" Asked a concerned Ginny.Hermione shook her head. "Stay here."oOoOoOoHermione wiped the tears on her eyes and checked herself in the mirror. Good thing she was wearing a waterproof mascara. She gave out a loud sigh and shook her hands, trying to stop those damn tears from falling. She has to be strong. She has to stop being weak.She heard the door open and it was Violet."Astoria wants to give you this." Violet handed her a white envelope.Hermione opened it and it was an invitation to the after party. It would be in Astoria's mansion."She expects you to be there." Violet turned on her heels and left.oOoOoOo"Of course she expects you to be there." Ginny retorted. "And she sent only one invitation. That sneaky bitch…making sure you're on your own.""I'll go, Gin. I could handle this." Hermione said with a determined look on her face. "Whatever Astoria is planning to do, I could handle it. I would fight for Draco. I know he would do the same for me." She paused. "What we had yesterday, I knew he felt it 'cause I felt it too."Ginny thought for a minute. "Fine. But call me if you need backup."Hermione smiled and pulled her friend into a hug."Go get your Draco." Ginny whispered to her ear.oOoOoOoDraco and Astoria were back to Astoria's place and so did some guests. The waiter was passing on some glasses of champagne and Draco took two glasses. He handed one to Astoria. "Congratulations for a very successful event.""Thanks love." Astoria said, clinking her glass to his. She took a sip and turned to face Draco. "I meant what I whispered earlier in the ramp. Why did you give me white tulips? You know how much I dislike them. You should have given me roses."Draco was about to say something when a photographer asked them to smile on the camera. "Sorry, I thought you liked tulips." He said still smiling. The photographer left and Astoria faced him once again. "Okay, fine. You are forgiven. But I'm still waiting for my real congratulation gift." She beamed at him "Let's just enjoy the night first." Astoria caught a sight of Hermione and then smiled. "Will you excuse me for a minute darling?"oOoOoOo"You came." Astoria greeted Hermione that irritated her to no end."Well, you invited me." Hermione smirked."You are one tough woman, aren't you?" She eyed Hermione from head to foot. "You clean up pretty well. Who knew that a mudblood like you would look pleasant?""I'm over the whole mudblood thing. Everyone is. Well, except you. So, what are you planning to do?" Hermione folded her arms and held her head high.Astoria laughed. "Oh dear, I don't have any plans. Actually, I just wanted to have some fun all night because I had a successful event." She sighed. "It feels great to have all the best in life…and one of those is Draco."Hermione snorted. "You don't have him. You're just manipulating him into something he's not. I'm going there to talk to him and tell him everything."Astoria smirked. "Fine. Go and talk to him." She leaned closer. "Good luck at that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some important guests to attend to." She walked away and greeted an elder lady.Hermione rolled her eyes and scanned the room. She looked from left to right and then finally saw him. She waltzed to his direction and was now standing beside him. He was talking to an old couple about some increase of sales of his company. Hermione tapped his shoulder. He stopped and glanced to her direction. She smiled at him and he just gave her a cold stare. Her smile started to fade. "Draco. I need to talk to you."Draco excused himself at the old couple and turned to face her. "What is it now?" He said in his cold voice that it sent shivers to her spine."It's about Astoria." Hermione began.Draco smirked. "You slapped her."She gaped. Trying to find the right words."So it's true then?" He sneered. "I thought you were different, Hermione. You lied to me…making sure I would enjoy your company more than Astoria. Astoria and I are strong. Not you or any of my friends could stop us. Just leave me alone." He turned on his heel and walked to the other end of the room and started talking with other guests.Astoria soon joined him and she snaked her arms around his waist. Hermione's eyes started to fill up with tears as she watched the love of her life in the arms of another woman. He clearly doesn't know her and he clearly doesn't want anything to do about her. This is Draco's world. This is where he truly belongs. She lost.She turned on her heel and started to walk away never looking up to hide her tear streak face. She bumped hard into someone."Sorry." She sobbed and continued her exit when she felt someone grasp her arm.She looked at her arm then darted her eyes up."Don't run away." That person said."Let me go." She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, her arm still grasped on the person's hand."No you can't. You can't back down now. You shouldn't give up."oOoOoOoA/N: WHO COULD IT BE? Dun Dun Dun Dun. I'm done with Chapter 29 but I'll post it tomorrow after you review this chapter. Please be patient with Draco. Thank you so much.

A/N: Please have a little faith on Draco. He's just a confused person. Review! I'm so excited since I'm almost done with this fic and the drama's getting higher and aaaahhhh! I am just too excited that I can't stop writing! HAHAHA! Thanks for the review.Chapter 29Previously on My Amnesia GirlShe turned on her heel and started to walk away never looking up to hide her tear streak face. She bumped hard into someone. "Sorry." She sobbed and continued her exit when she felt someone grasp her arm.She looked at her arm then darted her eyes up. "Don't run away." That person said."Let me go." She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, her arm still grasped on the person's hand."No you can't. You can't back down now. You shouldn't give up."oOoOoOoI always thought that I could be strong enough for the both of us. I always thought that I could do something…anything to have my Draco back. Am I too weak? Am I too impatient? What else could I do? Whenever I look around, all these people…this is home for Draco. As for me? I'm an alien to him. I feel the whole world crashed just by looking at them. I had to get the hell out of here. I can't move, I feel someone stopping me. He's grasping my arm. Who is it? Hermione moved her eyes to her arm then to the person who owns those long fingers. Those eyes, they look familiar. She knows who own them. When realization hit her, her jaw dropped. She never expected to see this person in front of her right here, right now. She can't stay and chat with him…she just wanted to get away. She can't bear to see Draco and Astoria together. She doesn't belong here. "Don't run away." He said."Let me go." She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, her arm still grasped on the person's hand. I just want to get out of here. The pain is unbearable."No you can't. You can't back down now. You shouldn't give up." He tried to pull her again once more."Just let me go Andrew." Hermione tried to pull away but Andrew was just too strong.Without hesitation, he looked her in the eye and said "Come." He pulled her and started to go to the other side of the room but then Andrew stopped causing Hermione to bump into him. Hermione looked at Andrew then at the view in front of them. Draco and Astoria were kissing.Hermione pulled her hand away, this time, he let go. She started walk away as fast as she could. Andrew trailed behind her."Hermione!" Andrew called out. They were outside the mansion, feeling the cold air of the night. She didn't stop and continued her way out. Andrew ran to catch up with her.He took her arms and turned her to face him. "Hermione-""It's all over now. It's useless." Hermione said without looking up at him. "Even though he lost his memory, even if we had to start over again –" She took a few short breath "I believed that he would remember me. But I was wrong."Andrew shook his head. "It's not like that.""No." Hermione looked up at him. "It may be upsetting and unfair but I have to finally accept it. The Draco Malfoy who's in my heart… The Draco Malfoy who loved me…" She sobbed. "He doesn't exist anymore."Andrew dropped his hands to catch hers. "You're a different kind of girl, Hermione. You're not like any other girls I've known. You don't give up that easily. You two breaking up because of this absurd situation…I can't allow that.""It's not about Astoria." She sighed wiping the last tear rolling down her cheek. "In the end, Hermione and Draco were only…a mere idea of what could have been."Andrew pulled her closer and wrapped his arms around her. She leaned her head on his chest. She's tired. She's given up. It's over.oOoOoOo"Here we are!" Draco waved his hand around."We're in the kitchen?" Astoria raised her brow.He happily nodded. "You are going to bake those cupcakes you made me last time. I'll help you."She shook her head. "No. I don't feel like doing it right now. We just had the launch yesterday and the after party, I'm tired Draco."He sighed and pulled her closer. "Come on, let's do this." He started putting on his apron when Astoria stopped him."Draco, I'll do this by myself. You should go and wait in your library." She winked. "I got this."He pouted but then waved his hand. "Fine. It better be good like it did the last time."She smiled and shooed him away.When she was alone she groaned in frustration and called Hailey, her house elf. "Bake this red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting also with this design thing that looked like Draco. Fast."Hailey nodded and worked around the kitchen. Astoria sighed and pointed her wand to the kitchen door to lock it. She heard her phone ring. "Hello?""Astoria. It's me, Andrew.""Oh, hi Andrew. How are you? I'm sorry if I wasn't able to entertain you last night.""We need to talk. Meet me at my office later.""Sure. I just have to finish this thing with Draco. See you later. Bye." She placed her phone back in her pocket and saw that Hailey was almost done. Astoria took three pieces of cupcake and placed it in a small plate.She levitated the plates as she went her way to the library. "Here are your cupcakes, love." She announced and set the plate down on the coffee table. Draco clapped his hands, excited to finally taste the delicious cupcakes Astoria made. He glanced down at the cupcakes and it looked different. It did look like him but not what Astoria and Hermione made before. Astoria took a small fork and sliced a piece of the cupcake and fed it to Draco.He frowned. It didn't taste like he expected it to be. This was too sweet."You don't like it?" She was nervous.He swallowed the cupcake and leaned back to his chair. "This doesn't taste like the same cupcake you made." He placed his fingers on his cheek. "Were you really the one who made those cupcakes before?""Y-yes." She stuttered. "I'm just really tired Draco that's why it didn't taste the same as it was before. I could do it again."He sighed and narrowed his eyes, looking at a far distance.Astoria leaned closer. "Is something bothering you?"He glanced at her. "Let me be honest, I told you that I would try to erase Hermione from my mind…but after last night, in my dreams…her face…her expression. I find it difficult to erase it…to forget about it.""Enough! That's too much." Astoria screeched. "You tell this to me after everything I've done to you? After all the pain you've cost me? You're being fooled by Hermione, Draco. Believe me, it's true. How many times do I have to tell you this?" She clenched her jaw trying to catch her breath. "The moment you woke up, you didn't have feelings for her. You don't know her. She pretends to know you. You were irritated when she's always around you then you tell me you can't erase her in your mind. You're hurting me too much Draco." She started to cry."Hey." Draco placed his hand on top of hers. He hates when he sees a woman cry. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean all those things.""I'm too hurt Draco.""I know. I'm stupid. I'll make it up to you, I promise."She glanced up at him and wiped her tears with her handkerchief. "There is only one thing you could do to make it up to me."oOoOoOo"Andrew." Astoria smiled at Andrew."Astoria." He gave a short nod. "Please sit."Astoria sat at the couch at the corner of Andrew's office. He finished signing the documents he was reading then stood up and sat at the loveseat opposite Astoria."How are you?" Astoria said."Stay away from Draco." He said with a similar deadpan voice and facial expression."What?""You heard me. You stay away from Draco. You're hurting Hermione.""That would never happen. And why are you protecting Hermione?""Because she's my friend and she's important to me."She scoffed. "If she's important to you, then you should be happy about it. We could work together. I get Draco and you get Hermione."He shook his head. "I don't want it to be this way."She folded her arms. "I won't give Draco up. I've worked so hard on this."He smirked. "You mean you've lied so much for this.""I don't care if I lie. I don't care if I'm hurting anyone. As long as I get Draco, I'm happy." She placed her hand in front of her face. "Is this why you asked me to go and meet you? Well, sorry to say this Andrew, but no one and not even you could stop me." She stood up abruptly and headed to the door."You might be forgetting something Astoria."She stopped and turned to face him. "And what is that?""My family helped your family with this huge amount of galleons so you could save the Greengrass Empire. I believe since I am now the CEO of my family's company, I could liquidate all my shares to your Empire. All that your parents and your sister ever worked for could be gone in just one signature."Astoria gaped. "You can't do that."He stood up, a slow menacing smile formed his lips. "I could and I would if you won't leave Hermione and Draco alone. If you hurt her more Astoria, I swear, you and your family would go back to being broke."She huffed and stormed off his office. Let's see about that Andrew. I have another plan in mind.oOoOoOo"I'm doing this for Astoria." Draco was on his phone talking to Philippe. "Heindrichs will tell me the details in our meeting."It was Monday and the sky was covered in dark gray clouds. Draco still couldn't sleep last night. Hermione kept popping on his mind. The look on her face when he told her to leave him alone…what happened last Friday…Everything. He should feel great, right? He finally made a decision and he chose Astoria. But why is he feeling differently?He checked his watch. "I'm meeting Heindrichs in two minutes. Okay. Send me the report later and I'll check on it." He pressed the button on his phone and went out his office. He made a beeline to the conference room. He opened the door and found that Mr. Heindrichs wasn't alone."Andrew." Draco smirked.oOoOoOo"I think I've punched you too hard to have some loose screws in your head." Andrew stood up from his seat.Draco raised his brow. "I beg I don't know what you're saying."Andrew laughed. "Oh right, the amnesia thing. Good thing you remember me. Well, except the fight we had before."Mr. Heindrichs could feel the tension between the two men so he decided to leave them alone in the conference room."I've heard we fought. But I don't know why and I don't care what it is about." Draco said grimly.Andrew shook his head. "No. I think you should know. You see, we like the same girl…turns out she likes you more.""Sucks for you then." Draco smirked."Yeah, I agree. But, it had me asking…How many times do I have to punch you for you to realize that it would always be you and Hermione?"Draco pretended to take a lint off his coat. "No matter what you or anyone says…I don't care. I don't have any feelings for Hermione.""So…" Andrew grinned. "It's okay if I ask Hermione out on a date?" His face lit up. "Oh, I have a great idea. Why don't we have a double date?""That's not going to happen.""Why?" Andrew smirked. "Are you scared that you might get jealous?""No. That's not the case.""So it's settled then." Andrew clapped his hand once. "I'll see you and Astoria tomorrow at eight in the evening at this restaurant that I own."Draco nodded and opened the door. "See you then. If you don't mind, Heindrichs and I have this meeting."Andrew nodded and placed his hands on his pocket. "It's nice seeing you Draco. You look good for someone who's stupid." He whistled his way out and called out to Heindrichs.Draco gritted his teeth and clenched his jaw.Heindrichs entered the conference room and sat down on his vacated seat. "So, about America."oOoOoOoDraco massaged his head. He's been seeing images after images in his mind then it would disappear again. He decided to have coffee on the bakery he and Hermione went to last Friday. He took his cup and blew his coffee. He took a sip and sighed at his pure cup of coffee, no milk, no sugar.The door to the bakery opened and a small bell rang. "Hi George. I'm running late so I need to buy four pieces of croissants. It would be my brunch."Draco glanced up and saw it was Hermione. He panicked. He doesn't know if he should hide or if he should greet her. Scratch that. He can't greet her after telling her she should leave him alone. He tried his best to not catch her attention but failed miserably."Draco?" Hermione also seemed petrified to see him in that bakery.He smirked. "Hey.""Hi." She waved and checked her watch. "I-I have to go." She was about to run off when Draco called her. She stopped and glanced at him."I met this guy named Ben." He looked down on his coffee. "He was the guy-""Who saved your life… I know him." Hermione finished his sentence. "What happened?"He was surprised that he didn't seem surprised that Hermione would still talk to him even after last night. Which surprised him more is that she was in a hurry but still had time to listen to his stupid story."He told me what happened but never finished because my head started to ache." He peered up at her.She shifted from foot to foot. "Oh. So are you feeling better now?" He nodded. "I know you'll have another chance to meet him and he'll tell you everything."Why is this so awkward? Why do I want to be okay with Hermione?"Hermione – I'm…"She raised her hand. "No. It's okay. I understand. Look – I have to go…."Draco bit his lip. "Hermione.""Yes?""I know I shouldn't ask you this…but I don't know who else to ask and you're here and I really need to know…"Hermione gave a weak smile. "Just ask Draco.""What gift should I give Astoria to congratulate her?"Hermione felt a bit off balance which almost cost her to drop the croissants she's holding. "Oh, uhm… I don't know Astoria, but I guess…jewelries?"Draco nodded. "Yeah. Why didn't I think of that before? I gave her this bracelet and she kept it all this time.""Oh. I think you won't be able to make the same bracelet. There's no snow around." Hermione pointed outside."What are you saying? I bought it in Paris.""Right." She opened her mouth to say something then she closed it back again. "Word of advice, try touching the bracelet." She waved her hand and was about to leave the bakery when her phone rang. She took it out of her satchel. "Hello? Hi Andrew."Draco's head shot up the moment he heard Andrew's name then when Hermione caught him he pretended to be busy with his cup of coffee."Yeah. He did? Well he's in front of me now. Are you sure? Okay. Sure. See you later? Alright. Bye."Draco peeked sideways and saw Hermione smiling at her phone. She left the bakery smiling from ear to ear."She didn't even say goodbye to me." He whispered. He narrowed his eyes. Wait. Why am I even bothered that she didn't say goodbye to me? Why was she smiling? Was it because she'll see Andrew later?"I haven't seen Hermione smile like that for a long time." Chef George muttered. "I guess the young lady is inlove."Draco gritted his teeth. Not only is he irritated that Hermione was smiling while talking to Andrew. He was irritated to the idea that he's irritated right now.oOoOoOo"Cancel all my meeting today, I'll go to Paris to buy something for Astoria." Draco told his assistant while driving his way to the airport.Astoria told him he bought the bracelet he gave her in Swarovski. He would go there and buy her another charm or another bracelet as a gift to congratulate her for her successful event. He's trying his very best to think of anything but Hermione. He doesn't want Andrew to be right. Andrew is wrong, right?oOoOoOo"Hello Sir, how may I help you?" A petite blonde woman asked him."I would like to ask your advice for this bracelet?" He took out the picture of the bracelet from his wallet. It was a picture of him and Astoria in the fashion show event. "I guess I would like to know if you have some new charms for this."The woman frowned. "We don't have any of that, Sir, nor do we make that kind of bracelet. But we could make one if you like.""But I bought this here." Draco raised his brow. "I couldn't be wrong."The woman shook her head. "I've been working here for ten years sir, I'm pretty sure we haven't made that kind of bracelet."Draco nodded and left the store. If he never bought it in Swarovski, then where? He remembered what Hermione said a while ago in the bakery "Word of advice, try touching the bracelet."He decided that he would just fly back to London and buy Astoria a new dress.oOoOoOo"I'm looking for a dress for my girlfriend." He told the sales lady. The sales lady nodded and pointed out different dresses from the rack which made him really bored. "Can you just pick all the best dresses you have and I'll take them all. Thank you." He took a seat in the couch and saw three sales lady hurriedly picking dresses after dresses from the rack.A woman and a little girl entered the store. Draco noticed the bracelet of the little girl. It looked just the same as Astoria's. He stood up and greeted the woman who instantly blushed."Hello. I'm Draco Malfoy. I just notice the bracelet your daughter is wearing. May I ask where she got it?"The woman looked at her daughter and her mouth formed a small 'o' "Well, it was a gift from a friend. It was snowing that time.""Who is this friend?"The woman was about to say something when someone called him. He glanced and saw it was Blaise."It's good to see you Draco. How are you?"The woman excused herself and left with her daughter."I'm good. You?""Never been better. When are you going to join the gang? We've been missing you a lot."Draco smirked. "I've been really busy at work and I do spend time with Astoria."Blaise's lips formed a straight line. "Well, if you have time...then just come over. You're always welcome."Draco nodded. "Oh, wait…I'm having this party on Wednesday at the Abraxas Mansion. It's a party that Astoria organized. Could you be the one to inform the rest?""Oh. Okay. Sure. I have to go. Pansy is waiting for me. See you on Wednesday."Draco waved his hand and went to the cash register. He paid all the dresses he purchased and went to Astoria's place.oOoOoOo"These dresses are lovely. Thank you." Astoria gave a small peck on Draco's cheek. Draco gave a small smile."I went to Paris today.""You went to Paris to buy me these dresses?"He smirked. "No.""What did you do there?" This caught her curiosity.He shrugged. "Nothing." He took her arm and looked down on the bracelet. Astoria took her arm away. "I should try this on, don't you think?" She took some dresses and one of it got caught up on the bracelet. She took it off placed it on the coffee table. "Wait here. I'm going to change in the room."Draco watched the bracelet. He didn't buy it anywhere but it certainly wasn't a unique bracelet. A little girl had the same bracelet and it was given by a friend. Who could be that friend? Touch the bracelet. He remembered Hermione. He pointed at the bracelet and then it began to transform into a snowflake. His eyes grew wide and when he heard Astoria coming out of her room, he transformed it back again to a bracelet."What's wrong?" Astoria noticed the look in his eyes."Nothing." He leaned back to his chair. "Oh, I saw Andrew today."Astoria tried to looked nonchalant. "What did he say?""Nothing." He said once more. "We have this double date with Andrew."Astoria raised her brow. "I'm guessing Hermione is his date." She folded her arms. "And you agreed with it?"He shrugged. "Why not? We could handle a simple dinner, right?"She sighed and took a seat beside him. She rested her head on his shoulder. "I have to tell you something." She leaned closer and took Draco's hands. "Andrew is blackmailing me. He said I should leave you alone or else he would liquidate all his shares in my family's company."Draco took her arm. "He said that?""He's a friend of Hermione.""I see." He frowned. "Then let him do that. I would pay whatever he takes from you."Astoria grinned and wrapped her arms around him. "You are the best, love. Thank you.""Whatever Andrew is planning, it would never ever work. We'll show them." Draco said.I told you Andrew, I have a plan. And my plan always works. Astoria grinned like she has won the lottery.oOoOoOoHermione and Andrew were in a small but very noisy bistro. Everyone was busy talking with one another. Some were even having their round of beers and some were very intimate in the corner. It was a great day and she truly needed this. Though seeing Draco twisted her wounded heart, she was still happy. She saw that he was doing well, she finished her work, and she's here right now in a cozy bistro with a long lost friend."I'm so happy you're here." She said. "I'm sorry about last night. I was a mess and –"Andrew stopped her. "It's okay. I understand. You don't have to explain." He reassured her. "I know how you felt last night."She gave him a weak smile. She knew exactly what he meant. If she were asked if she knew anyone who went through the same situation, Andrew would be the perfect answer."I thought you're in America for good?" She said, trying to change the topic."I was invited to Astoria's fashion launch. My parents insisted me to attend."Hermione continued to stare at him as a sign that she won't buy it.He smiled. "You know me too well. It's true, I was invited…however…"She had a smug look on her face which made him laugh. She was right."I've heard about Draco. Cissy told my mother everything and my mother told me. I was worried."She snorted. "You're worried about Draco? That's new."He gave a small smile. "No…I was worried… about… you."She bit her lip and looked away. He placed his hand on top of hers and gave it a little squeeze. She looked at their clasped hands and can't help feeling the tears forming at the corner of her eyes. This is Andrew, though she hurt him many times, he's still there for her. Why can't she love him instead of Draco? Well that's absurd. She could never love anyone the way she loves Draco. Andrew has always been a great friend and at this moment, he knew what she was going through that she doesn't need to say anything."Don't cry, Hermione. Everything will get better soon."She gave out a loud sigh and wiped the tears in her eyes with her hands. "You're right. I should stop crying. I'm a strong woman and I would fight until the very end."He grinned. "That's the Hermione I know." He squeezed her hand one last time and pulled his hand away. "Now, how about some chocolate cake?"oOoOoOoA/N: I told you all I would post this chapter after the reviews. Coming up next is the double date, the party and then it's over? I would write the epilogue. *smiles* Thank you for the reviews and I hope you'll review again.

A/N: Please don't forget to review and I would like to thank all the readers who gave their opinion! Disclaimer: I don't own HP Series and the movie My Amnesia Girl.Chapter 30Tuesday morning, Hermione was back at her studio. Though she still felt numb and empty, she has to move on with her life. Draco did, so she should too. There is nothing she could do to let him remember her but she still prays that she would be given one last chance to win him over. Maybe not now but someday… she doesn't care…just as long as she gets her one last chance.Though Draco may have said or did some things to her, she doesn't blame him. She loves him and she understands what he's been going through. He lost the part of memory where she was in and it's her job to fill in that gap.She was looking at the pictures on her desk when she heard Elena call out to her. "Hermione. You have a visitor." Hermione raised her brow and went out of her office. She smiled to see who it was. "Hi Andrew." She gave him a quick hug. "What are you doing here?""Well, I'm planning to take you out to lunch.""We had dinner last night." She pointed out, pulling away from his arms."And now, lunch." He grinned."I have a very busy schedule. I've been missing work for a few days now.""Schedule is clear for the day." Elena announced.Hermione took a quick glance at Elena then back at Andrew. "Okay, fine. But before you treat me to lunch, you should help me out with these pictures." She took his hand and led him to her office.oOoOoOo"This is really good, Hermione." Andrew said while holding up one picture. Hermione leaned in closer to see what picture he was talking about. She smiled, "I really had fun taking that one. Good thing I had time to sneak in some pictures of my own while having a break at Astoria's photo shoot."Andrew glanced at her and grinned. "We should really work together you know. I need some pointers for my own photos."Hermione laughed. "You don't take bad photos."He snorted and placed the picture down on top of the desk. "Right. You really know how to make a man feel better." He took the camera on the edge of the desk and moved it up to his face. "So, are you going to give me a lesson or not?"She made a face then heard the camera shutter. She gasped and looked at him and there was another click. "Stop it, Andrew. Seriously. I've got a lot of work to do and I'm hungry."He chuckled. "If you just agreed to have lunch first then we would've been done with these pictures right now." He took another click from her camera. "Now, let me see the hungry face."She glanced at him and had a straight face. He laughed. "That's your hungry face?""Yes. This is it." She said while keeping her face straight.He shrugged and took another shot in the camera. "I really miss taking pictures of you."She took her camera from his grasp quickly and took a shot of him. "Come to think of it, I haven't taken photos of you yet." She took a couple of shots of Andrew."Don't forget to get my good side." Andrew smiled and she took a shot of it.She looked at the small screen of her camera. "Wow. You look like a model here."He stood beside her and leaned closer. "Nah. I don't."She giggled. "I was just kidding."He pretended to look hurt.She frowned. "No. I don't mean it. You look really handsome in this picture."His lips curved into a smile. "Gotcha!"She playfully punched his arm. "You're such a git! How old are you? Twelve?""Actually, I'm thirteen." He smirked. "So you think I'm handsome eh?"She rolled her eyes but can't help but smile at his adorable face. "Oh, shut up." She noticed a figure standing by the door of her office. Her eyes grew wide. "Draco?"oOoOoOoWhat is this? Why am I feeling jealous? I was the one who broke up with Hermione. I was the one who told her to stay away and now as I see this in front of me, I feel fucking jealous. What's wrong with me? But the most important question is…Why the fuck am I here? Oh right. I wanted to talk to someone and while I was walking on the pavements, somehow, I brought myself here. I don't know that this was her studio, mind you, but it seems like my feet led me here. Somehow the person in the front desk isn't there and I found myself going deeper inside this quite familiar studio. Another image flashed in my mind then again, it disappeared. Shit. She's laughing. Though I have no memory of her laugh, it sends this kind of warmth in my stone cold heart. Odd, but I love hearing her laugh. Fuck! Why am I irritated that it's fucking Andrew who's making her laugh? I have to get away before they see me. "Draco?"Draco closed his eyes briefly then opened them again. Fuck."Hermione. Andrew." He gave a curt nod."What are you doing here?""I-I…" He trailed off. He himself doesn't know the answer to that question.Hermione, however, looked worried – nervous even like she's been caught or something. Andrew placed his hand at the small of her back. Draco clenched his fists, of course, Andrew noticed."What are you doing here Draco?" Andrew repeated with grim on his voice.Draco cleared his throat. "I was just around and I noticed this studio. I didn't know you work here." He kept his gaze on her making her blush."Oh." Hermione motioned to the couch on the corner of her small office. "Please, sit."Draco shook his head. "Thanks but I have to leave now." He looked like he remembered something. "Luckily you're here Andrew." He handed a small white envelope. "Astoria and I will throw a party tomorrow at Abraxas Mansion at nine in the evening." Hermione can't help the pang she's feeling on her chest as she heard his announcement.Andrew took the envelope. "This feels like déjà vu." He held his finger up. "Oh, but I was the one giving you the invitation. Do you remember that?" He winced. "Oh right, you don't, but thank you. You could've just handed it to me later in our double date."Draco smirked and chose to ignore Andrew's remarks. "I'll see you later and tomorrow at the party. May I remind you that it's a black and white masked ball." He turned on his heel when Andrew called him again. "Yes?"Andrew smirked. "I could bring my date, right?"Draco nodded. "Of course you can. Who is your date?""Well, obviously Miss Greengrass is your date so it means…" He snaked his arms around Hermione's waist. "Hermione is my date."Draco clenched his jaw and stared at the arms of Andrew. Another flash of image crossed his mind then it disappeared again once more. He felt like he would punch Andrew's face anytime. Hermione pulled away from Andrew's grasp and bit her bottom lip. "We're going out as friends." Why am I explaining? She thought.Draco nodded and waltzed out of the studio.Hermione turned to face Andrew. "What was that about?"Andrew shrugged. "What?"Hermione shook her head. "Now he would think…"Andrew placed his hand on her shoulder. "Hey. It doesn't matter what he thinks. Look, now we know we would have an interesting double date later."She looked up at him, confused. "How could you say that?""I just have a hunch. Now, can we eat?"She nodded. "Fine. Let's go. I'll just go and get my satchel."oOoOoOoSomewhere far from the corner Draco was inside his car watching the beautiful young lady whose hand was in the arm of another man. He scowled as he saw her smile at Andrew. This seems very strange yet familiar. He never knew that he could feel this way. Is this pain? Just by looking at them, something was clenching his heart. He never even knew he had a heart.He asked his driver to drive away and bring him back to his office. He had to get away now.oOoOoOoAfter lunch, Hermione felt much better but at the back of her mind, she was still worried about Draco. They were in the park where she took Draco out on a picnic dinner. She smiled when she saw the spot where they ate."So, what are you going to wear later?" Andrew asked.She shrugged. "I don't know. Hey – Andrew – do you think this is a good idea?" She shifted from foot to foot. "You know... go on a double date with Draco and Astoria?"He chuckled and placed his hand on top of her head. "You think too much. Loosen up a bit." He dropped his hands down and took a yellow tulip from the ground."You didn't answer my question."He glanced at her. "I did."She snorted. "I don't know if I could see them…together." Her voice fading slowly.He handed the tulip to her. "Hey. I'm here. I won't leave you. And someone needs to knock some senses on that git."She laughed quietly. She was nervous, feeling her hands and feet turn cold. She watched Andrew who was enjoying the view, her mind wandering off. Not too long ago, a woman once told me that I would find my soul mate someday. That was when I was taking photos for her family portrait. Draco was with me that time. I had to admit that I thought it was Draco but no…Andrew is my soul mate. That's the difference between the two. Andrew is my soul mate but Draco is my true love. Is that even possible? That your soul mate and your true love are two different people? No matter how long I've known Andrew. I can't find myself being romantically involved with him. Hermione thought to herself.He caught her looking at him. "Galleon for your thoughts?"She looked away. "Nothing."Andrew smiled sadly at the woman in front of him. I'm still in love with you, Hermione. But I know you're hurting just like you did before. I won't let that happen again even if it means giving you back to Draco. I just want to see you happy. That's one promise I would like to keep. He looked away again. "I'll drop you off to your place to give you time to prepare for our double date. I'll pick you up at seven thirty, yes?"She nodded giving one last look at the spot where she had a picnic with her true love.oOoOoOoHermione checked herself in the mirror. She was wearing a royal blue sleeveless dress with a sweetheart bodice that reached just above her knees. For her feet, a matching royal blue pumps. Her hair was in a one sided soft waved curls. On her ears were pearl drop earrings. Again, she asked Ginny for help on her makeup which is enough to make her eyes pop.She went down the steps where Andrew was waiting for her. He was wearing gray suit and slacks and black shirt. His hair, which was just a little darker than hers, was neat but messy at the same time. He looked stunned and when they were face to face, his eyes softened. "You look really beautiful."Hermione blushed. "Thank you. You look very handsome tonight." She fixed his tie and brushed off his shoulders."Let's go?" He offered his arm and she gracefully took it. "Let's go." She answered.oOoOoOoDraco and Astoria arrived at the restaurant at exactly eight in the evening. He was wearing black slacks and coat. Underneath, he was wearing blue shirt that has the first two buttons open. Astoria placed her hand on his arms. He looked at her and smirked. She was wearing red halter top dress that hugged her form. Her straight hair covered her back. She was wearing beige stilettos that made her taller and enhanced her long legs. Just when they were about to enter, Andrew stepped out of his black sleek car. He walked to the other side and opened the door for Hermione. She turned and instantly saw Draco.Draco swallowed. She's very beautiful. He noticed the other people outside the restaurant watching her as well. He saw a hint of blush on her cheeks. He frowned when Andrew offered his hand and she gladly accepted it. Astoria took her hand and gave her a look clearly reminding him that she is his date. She looked at Hermione once more and then at Draco noticing that they were both wearing blue. "Did you know she was wearing a blue dress?"Draco glanced at her then at his shirt. "No." He didn't notice that they were wearing the same color until Astoria asked him. He already planned to wear the shirt he was wearing for this dinner yesterday.Andrew smirked and gave a short nod to both Draco and Astoria. There was a huge tension surrounding them. Andrew just led Hermione inside the restaurant while Draco and Astoria followed behind.The manager, whose name tag says Daniel, greeted them cheerfully. Though he was all smiles and full of energy, Hermione could sense his nervousness because Andrew was here and to top it off, Draco was with them which intimidated the poor old man to no end.Daniel led them to a secluded area and Hermione gasped at the pictures that were hanging in the wall. Draco looked up and saw the pictures. He stilled. They were photos of Hermione.oOoOoOoHermione tugged Andrew's arm. Andrew looked down at her and winked. She leaned forward and whispered. "I know you did this on purpose."Andrew gave a one arm shrugged. "I won them at an auction. I think I could place them anywhere I want." He stood up straight and made his voice louder. "This is my restaurant's lucky charm."Draco gritted his teeth. These photos were familiar. He saw an image of a dark room, a glass of champagne and a spot light. He stumbled a little which caught Astoria and Hermione's attention. Hermione was about to go to his side when Astoria placed her hand on Draco's face, asking him if he was okay.Hermione's throat tightened. She looked away. "Could you take these pictures off? Please." Andrew frowned and took his wand out of his pocket. He flicked it once and the photos were gone. "I'm sorry."Andrew offered a chair for Hermione and she sat down. Draco did the same for Astoria and when they were all settled, Daniel went back with a waiter trailing behind him. The waiter poured champagne on their glasses and left them again. Andrew asked Daniel for their starters. Daniel nodded and left them again. Astoria was seating across Andrew, Draco to Hermione. Feeling the awkward silence, Andrew cleared his throat and lifted his glass near his lips. "So, Astoria, have you made your decision regarding my proposal yesterday?"Astoria smiled sweetly. "I did and I think I would decline." She placed her hand on top of Draco's. She took a sip of her champagne and faced Hermione. "You'll know about it during our party tomorrow. Which reminds me…Draco, darling, did you give them the invitation?" She looked at Draco.Draco didn't turn to face Astoria. He kept his gaze fixed at Hermione. He didn't even acknowledge the hand of Astoria to his. "Yes. I gave it to Andrew yesterday."Hermione looked at their hands. Draco pulled his hand away. Astoria's lips thinned."Yeah. Draco gave me the invitation and I told him Hermione would be my date."Astoria raised her brow and turned to face Hermione. "Are you both dating?"Hermione looked nervously at Draco but before she could speak Andrew answered for her. "We're not there yet, Astoria, since someone here doesn't approve of me being around Hermione." He raised his glass to Draco.Astoria frowned and eyed Draco and Hermione. Hermione just shrugged and took a sip on her glass. The tension was brought to a halt when the doors opened and three waiters entered with their food on fine silver trays.oOoOoOoDraco can't help but watch the two people in front of him. They look so happy and comfortable with each other. Hermione even did this thing that she does when there is dirt in someone's face. His scowl deepened when Andrew took a piece of Hermione's steak and she did the same with his lamb. They both nodded in agreement that both main course were delicious.Andrew caught Draco's eyes. He smirked and purposely placed his hand on top of Hermione's and gave it a little squeeze. "Hermione, remember the time when Meg slipped on this mud and everyone took pictures of her instead of our surroundings?"Hermione laughed. "Oh I remember that. Merlin, my tummy hurt that time from laughing." Meg was one of their friends who also took up photography class same time they did."Who's Meg?" Astoria said trying to get in their conversation.Andrew glanced at her. "She's one of our friends in photography class. That's how Hermione and I met, through our camera lenses."Astoria's lips formed a small 'o'. "I remember that Andrew was talking about this girl crush he had in that class. If I'm not mistaken, that's you, isn't it Hermione?"Hermione grinned. "I don't think so. You see, there are a lot of girls in our group and –""Yep, she's the girl I've been crushing on."Draco clenched his fist under the table. "You did or still do?"Andrew's lips twitched. "I did have a crush on her. Why?" He turned to face Hermione who was shaking her head slightly. She knew he was just pushing Draco's buttons. He sighed. "To be honest, I still do. Who wouldn't?"Astoria pursed her lips and raised her brow to Andrew. "What did you like about her?""Well, Hermione is just herself and I liked her just the way she is." He turned to face Draco. "You would know – Ouch!" He hissed and knew who kicked him in the shin.Hermione smiled sweetly at Andrew. "So, Andrew, how was your stay in New York?"Draco watched Hermione while she took quick glances at him. She doesn't want to talk about the past in this date. She knew well that it would only annoy Draco and she would preferably have Draco's past on her own than sharing it with Astoria.Andrew's smile widened. "New York is great, noisy, but great. There are galas I've been attending and the paparazzi are crazy.""You didn't meet anyone there?" Draco smirked."There are many beautiful women there but not as beautiful as Hermione."Andrew took Hermione's hand once again and gave it a little squeeze."Aww. You're so sweet Andrew. You both look good together." Astoria smile, but her smile doesn't seem to reach her eyes. She interlaced her fingers with Draco. "Isn't it nice to finally have someone in your life? Do you agree with me, Hermione?""Yes. I agree." Hermione gave a small smile to Astoria then her gaze moved to Draco who was still giving her his icy stare.Three waiters entered and cleared their table. Daniel announced what they were having for dessert and there were four waiters with single silver trays in their hand. They placed each tray in front of them and opened the lid. Hermione, Andrew and Draco were having chocolate cake while Astoria had a low-fat rich fruit cake."Are you sure you don't want chocolate cake?" Draco asked Astoria, who shook her head."I don't like all the carbs in there." She gestured at his cake.Draco gave a one arm shrug and saw Hermione eating her own slice of cake. He could watch her all day eating. His lips curved as he saw her close her eyes briefly as she took a bite of her cake. She isn't the kind of woman who counts calories or carbs and yet she still has this petite body and long, slender legs. She saw him looking at her and she smiled. "It's delicious, isn't it?"Draco could only nod.oOoOoOo"Hermione, I have this great idea." Andrew paused. "Why don't you open a studio in New York?"They were finished with their dessert and were offered a glass of Malmsey Madeira. Astoria asked for a Vin Santo that matches the flavor of the fruit cake she had.Hermione almost choked on her glass. "What? Why?"Draco narrowed his gaze at Andrew. "You can't possibly do that." Astoria pursed her lips as she saw a new tension to erupt between two men."Why not?" Andrew challenged.Astoria wanted to say something when she was brought to a stop when Draco glared at her. She excused herself and went to the powder room."You are really trying to piss me off Andrew. You know what my meeting with Heindrichs was about."Hermione frowned, she has no idea what they were talking about.Andrew chuckled. "What? You think I wanted to bring Hermione in New York on purpose? Get over yourself, Draco. Not everything is about you." He took a sip of his glass. "We all know that I'm the one who's living in New York –""And I wish you'll just stay there." Draco interjected." – So I could decide what I want with my company and I could invite Hermione there whether you like it or not." He continued ignoring Draco's statement. "Besides, you could choose any other city you like. Why? Did you do plan this to stay away from Hermione?"Hermione gasped and looked at Draco. Though she can't understand what they were talking about, the thought that Draco was planning to stay away from her cut deeper into her heart. He could see she was hurt."I don't want to talk about this now." Draco stood."I love her." Andrew muttered.Draco froze, he felt like a cold bucket of water was splashed to him. Hermione jerked her head to Andrew's direction. "What?"Andrew looked at Hermione. "I do."Draco turned his head to the side. His fists white as he clenched it tightly. "Do whatever you want. I don't care anymore." He took long strides to the door. He took Astoria's arm, who was just about to enter, and they left.Andrew pinched the bridge of his nose. Hermione gaped at him. "What was that about? You love-""I'm sorry." He mumbled. Hermione tried to stand but Andrew took her arm. "Please, sit."Hermione made a frustrated noise. "Is this your plan? To piss him off? I could tolerate all the simple bicker you two had a while ago but telling me that you love me, even when we both know that it's just love between friends –""Stop." He placed his hand down and glanced at her. "I'm sorry. Okay? Come. I'll take you home." He stood and offered his hand to her.She sighed and took it. "You're still not forgiven."His lips curved. "I know. But I was really serious about New York."oOoOoOoDraco stormed off the restaurant pulling Astoria along with him. He dismissed the look on other people's faces and didn't even excuse himself while bumping to others as he exited the restaurant. He felt the cold night air hit his face. His car was waiting for him already, his driver opening the door for them. Draco instructed his driver to send Astoria home."What? You're not riding home with me?" Astoria looked at him in disbelief."No. Get in the car." He snarled."No. I'll stay here with you." She folded her arms, her chin lifting up a little.Draco groaned. "Astoria, get in the fucking car now."Astoria huffed and went inside. Draco slammed the door shut. When the car started to move, Draco walked to the opposite direction.oOoOoOoDraco walked and walked. He didn't know where he was but he continued on his journey until he found himself in the park where he and Hermione had a picnic. He smiled briefly, remembering the great time he had that day. He looked down and saw a white tulip. He bent down and traced the petal with his finger. An image flashed through his mind. There were a lot of tulips surrounding them and he was holding a white tulip like the one in front of him. He closed his eyes trying to remember but it was gone. He sighed and apparated back to his flat.He took of his coat and shoes. He walked to his room and flopped down his bed, his face buried in his pillow. He yelled. He hadn't felt this much pain before. It was even worse than crucio. Damn it, it hurts.He turned his head to the right and gasped for air feeling hot tears coming out of his eyes. He wiped it immediately with his palm. He turned his head to the left and saw the box Hermione gave him. He sat up and levitated the box and it landed carefully beside him on the bed.He opened it and pulled out the contents. He saw the albums, the book of tulips, post its, and all the 'evidence' of Hermione. He opened the photo album and saw again how happy they were before. He saw her smile and waving at him. The same smile she's giving to Andrew.He groaned and threw the album across the other side of the room. He threw all the things away, out of his bed and lay back down on his bed. He let tears flow freely on his face accepting this huge pang feeling on his chest. He hated it. He hated Andrew and he hated Hermione. He has to get away fast. He has to be as far away from Hermione as possible.Andrew loves her. It's too obvious. Even the most unromantic chap would know how madly in love Andrew is with Hermione. Do you love her? Draco heard someone say at the back of his mind. He doesn't know. He doesn't know if he loves her and yet – Fuck it, I'm crying here and acting weak. Hermione makes me weak.He rubbed his eyes with his palm and exhaled out loud. No. He's not weak. He'll push through his plan with Astoria.Astoria. He can't say that he loves her. He just likes her company because it is the closest to what he was used to do since he woke up from the hospital. But love? He doesn't even know if he's capable of loving someone. He loves his mother, but someone else? None.He knows that at some point he loved Hermione…but he can't remember it anymore nor will he even ever remember it. He can't just wait and let Hermione hang on to him. Now she has Andrew and he loves her and he treats her well. They deserve each other.Draco felt a huge lump on his throat. He can't bear to see Hermione and Andrew together. That's why I'm going away. Maybe when I move somewhere else, I would be able to get past this. As for Astoria, I know someday I'll return her feelings. I just need to get the fuck out of here.He stood, feeling the need to drink alcohol. He dragged his feet out of his room when he saw an old torn book just a few inches away from the box. He picked it up and read the title 'A Knight in Shining Armor'. It also said that it was written by Jude Deveraux. He flipped the pages and saw a sentence highlighted. "My soul will find yours."He frowned and placed the book on top of his drawers. He would read it another time.oOoOoOoA/N: Thanks for the reviews and follows. The next chapter is the end, btw. Then epilogue. Please review.The book 'A Knight in Shining Armor' was the favorite book of Hermione stated in Chapter 4.

A/N: I don't own anything. First of all, I would like to thank all of you for giving this fic a chance. I would also like to thank you all for the reviews AND for those who listed this as one of their favorite stories and for making me one of their favorite authors. I would write a Dramione fic again and I promise to minimalize errors by asking betas and others. But maybe I wouldn't be able to write right after this fic. I really should organize my schedule first. I'm going all out with this chapter cause I won't have time to update anymore, it's like 2-4 chapters in one. Epilogue would come next and I'll try my very best to submit it on time. Again, thank you.Chapter 31A phone was ringing. Hermione groaned. She peeked through one eye to check the time and it was two in the morning. Who the hell is calling at this hour?She reached for her phone on the bedside table causing some papers and magazines to fall on the floor. When she felt her cell phone on her fingertips, she grasped it and pressed the green button not even bothering to look at the small screen to see who was calling her."Hello?""Hi Hermione.""Harry? Why are you calling? Do you know that it is two in the morning?""I'm sorry. It's afternoon here." He said in a much louder voice. He seemed to be out in the street. Harry and Ron went to Australia to visit the Cassiopeia School for Wizards and Witches. They were guests for the quidditch championship in that school.She sighed and rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand. "Why did you call?""I just want to make sure you're okay. Are you?""I'm fine. Thanks for asking. I had a double date with Andrew.""Double date?" She heard him laugh silently."Yeah…with Draco and Astoria."She heard a loud sound over the phone so he asked her again to repeat what she said and when she did, he heard him whistle. "I could only imagine what happened. So, how was it?""Harry, it's two in the morning. I have to work later. I'll just tell you when you come back." She barely even slept. She slept for thirty minutes and now Harry was calling her. She would be like a walking zombie back at the studio later, worst at the masked ball."Fine. But, just to let you know, I'm glad Andrew is there for you. He could really keep his promise."She doesn't know if she heard him correctly. "Promise? What promise?""It's two in the morning over there. Go back to sleep. Love you 'Mione." The phone line went dead.She looked at her phone then placed it back down on top of her bedside table and went back to sleep.Promise? What promise?oOoOoOoHermione went back to work with three cups of coffee in a small paper tray in her hand. She was wearing black skinny jeans, a loose gray shirt, leather boots that reaches just below her knee and her hair was in a messy bun. She handed one coffee to Elena then went straight to Ginny's office."Good morning Hermione." Ginny's smile froze at what she saw. "Gosh, how long did you sleep?"Hermione just rolled her eyes and gave Gin her coffee. Ginny looked fabulous. She was wearing a black tank top and blue fitted jeans and high heel wedge. Her hair was straight that falls on her back."Thanks to your Harry." She groaned. "He called me at two in the morning."Ginny winced. "Sorry. I told him a short recap of what's happening right now."Hermione wave her hand. "It's okay. It was a short call. I just told him I had a double date."That got Ginny's attention. "How was it?"Hermione knew that Ginny wanted to know everything. She's been sparing some details to her friend and cried only when she was alone. Her friends has seen her to her lowest point – being forgotten and dumped by Draco, Astoria being a bitch and yet, they are still there for her, especially Ginny. She's very grateful for her dear friend because Ginny never asked if she isn't ready to talk yet. Ginny also covered most of her work while she was in the hospital with Draco and even after that. Hermione knows that whenever her friends see her cry, it hurts them, so she has to show that she could handle things on her own. She has to show that she is a strong person and not someone who is going to break down any minute now. "Andrew was pushing Draco too far." She gave a knowing look at Ginny.Ginny laughed. "I bet he did. Oh I wish I was there to see Malfoy's face."Hermione took a sip of her coffee. She placed her cup down on top of the desk and folded her arms while leaning her hip on the edge of the desk. She looked down at the floor and bit her lip. Last night was the most awkward date she's ever been. What was she thinking? Going on a double date with Andrew, her ex fiancé and his new girlfriend? She's so stupid sometimes. She's really calling for a total heart break."What's wrong Hermione?" She felt Ginny's hand on her arm. She turned her head to face her."Andrew said he still loves me." She dropped her arms and played with her fingers. "He said it to Draco."Ginny stood and walked in front of Hermione so they were an arm length apart. "He did? What did Draco say?"Hermione gave a one arm shrug, trying to fight back the tears in her eyes. "He said he doesn't care anymore."Ginny sighed and took her hands. "Hermione…" This was the first time Ginny was lost at words. Hermione would have to remember this day. Speaking of Andrew…"Do you know about a promise Andrew made to Harry?"Ginny pursed her lips, debating whether she should tell Hermione or not. She gave up and sighed, "A few years ago, during the classes in photography…well…you were crushed because…" She winced, not knowing the right way to put it. "Draco left you in the aisle." She blurted out in a rush, checking Hermione's reaction but she was gestured to move on. "Andrew really likes you, smitten even. He knew you were heartbroken, but he doesn't know Draco was the cause. He asked us, if we would allow him to spend time with you. He would help you heal along the way." She shifted from foot to foot. "As days go by, he fell in love with you. He even told you what he felt but you turned him down. It crushed him but he told Harry that he would wait for his time and he promised that he would always be there for you, even if it's clear that you love someone else."Hermione gaped at Ginny. "Why didn't you tell me this?""I'm sorry. But Andrew told us to be quiet about it. He doesn't want you to know. He wants you to like him when fate decides it to."Hermione nodded. She understood why Andrew wanted to keep it from her. If she knew about what he told his friends especially the promise he made, she might just go and try to date him even though she doesn't feel the same way because of the guilt she would feel for him. She would feel guilty because she was stopping him from moving on when she herself couldn't move on with the person who left her. And right now, history is repeating itself. Hermione glanced up to face Ginny and gave a small smile. "Thanks for telling me Gin.""Hermione, I want to be honest with you." She paused. "I know you couldn't let go of Draco even though he left you in the aisle a few years ago. We were all mad at him for doing that to you. We saw you hurting until you saw him again at Flourish and Blotts. Though you were trying so hard to show how you were over him, I saw that spark again in your eyes. We don't even know…you don't even know why you went back to him…""I love him." Hermione whispered."I know." Ginny nodded. "I realized that after the photo shoot you did with him of a family portrait." Ginny's lips curved a little. "I saw that smile again. I saw the old Hermione I know whenever you're with him. I thought finally, everything is finally right…but…""The accident." Hermione muttered.Ginny sighed. "Yes, the accident, the amnesia and Astoria. I saw you hurting again. It was even worse than the first one. Don't you think its fate telling you that you and Draco really aren't…" Her voice faded."Meant to be?" Hermione finished the sentence. "May I add to the choices that our timing may be off?" Her voices started to break. "If I had both choices, I would choose the second. Our time will come. I know that." She started to look down on the floor. "You told Harry before that it's me who could tell, not fate, not destiny, how this ends or begins.""Do you think that it's finally time to end it? I mean, I told you before that it isn't the end until the love you feel for one another is gone. Draco's love for you…""Is still there. I know it. I feel it." Hermione looked up to face her friend.Ginny knew well that she couldn't argue with Hermione. Draco is Hermione's happiness. No matter what Ginny says right now, Hermione would always have an answer. Ginny bit her lip. She has to tell Hermione everything. "During Andrew's event, I told Andrew that I knew he was walking away because it was easier than to fight for what he really wants."Hermione looked away from her."I just realized that he never walked away. He kept fighting." Ginny closed her eyes briefly then opened it again. She took Hermione's hands. "What if I was wrong before? I told Harry that it seems like you and Draco were made for each other. What if the right person for you isn't Draco?"Hermione looked at Ginny and pulled her hands away. "Gin. It's Draco. It was never Andrew."Ginny thought for a minute, she knew how much Hermione loves Draco, however, "It kills us slowly every time we see you crying.""I know. Gin – can we not talk about this now? Excuse me." Hermione turned to leave Ginny's office and darted to her own space. Once she was in her own office, she closed her door slowly and locked it, putting silencing charm around so they won't hear her cry.She slowly melted to the floor and hid her face in her palms. Somehow, she felt like Ginny slapped her back to reality. What Ginny said made her realize that everything was happening again. Draco left her and Andrew was picking up the pieces. She wiped her tears away and stood up. There was one mistake that she failed to see before and she had to stop it before Draco does it again.oOoOoOoHermione's cell phone rang. She saw in the small screen that it was Andrew. She ignored his call and continued to work. She wasn't ignoring him...scratch that…okay, maybe a little. She wanted to be away from Draco and Andrew for a while. She needed to think of something else like her work and finishing up her portfolio.There was a knock on her door. She took her wand and unlocked it as well as taking off the silencing charm. The door opened and Ginny's head popped up."Hey." Ginny gave a smile."Hey." Hermione motioned her to come inside."Hermione – about a while ago – What I said…" Ginny shifted from one foot to another. "It's not my place…""No. It's okay. You are family, Gin. You could say what you have to say. I need it."Ginny nodded. "I'm still sorry, Hermione. I just want to see you happy again.""I love Draco. I still do. Tonight may be the last night I'll ever see him. He and Astoria will announce something, but whatever it is, it's the last chance I have.""I'll be there with you." She waved an invitation in front of her. "Theo gave me this.""I'll be there with you too." They heard someone by the door frame.Ginny and Hermione craned their neck to see who it was. "Harry?"Ginny darted to him and wrapped her arms around him and gave him a sweet kiss on the lips. She pulled away and cocked her head to the side to Hermione. Harry walked towards Hermione, who was now standing in front of her desk, and gave her a warm hug. "We're always here for you Hermione."Hermione fought back the tears which were starting to pool in her eyes. "Thank you." She pulled away.Harry took her hands and sighed. "I don't know why the hell you still love that git. But whatever that big brain of yours reasons is, we'll help you fight this one last battle."Ginny walked up to them and placed her hand on Hermione's arm. "We have to make you look fabulous, show Draco what he's missing. Now, we should start to look for a killer dress –""No need to." They heard another voice behind them."Ron!" Hermione ran towards him and gave him a quick hug. Ron raised one finger up and left her office again. When he came back, he was levitating dozens of boxes."These are dresses, shoes, jewelries, everything you need for tonight." Ron gave his sheepish smile.Hermione and Ginny looked skeptical at the boxes and Ron immediately read their mind. "Oh, Lavander was the one who picked everything out."Harry sniggered, earning a death glare from Ron.Hermione looked at her friends. "Thank you… all of you. I feel like Cinderella."oOoOoOo"Finally. I thought you'll never answer. I'm beginning to think I did something wrong." Andrew said in a rush. From the tone of his voice, Hermione knew he was worried. She finally answered his phone call."I was busy. Harry and Ron were here a while ago.""Oh right. Harry called me this morning.""He did?""Yes. He used the plane I designed. The one I told you before, remember?"Hermione nodded. That was the time when they rode on the new plane of Draco. She smiled at that memory. Draco was really annoyed that she agreed to tag Andrew along. They went to Draco's mansion in Greece, the same mansion they were going tonight."Hello? Hermione?""Still here."There was silence on the other line then she heard him speak again. "I'll pick you up at eight thirty. We'll drive to the airport then use the TelevPort." Andrew told her that the TelevPort is the new invention of his company. It looks like an elevator but there are a few buttons that you would press and it would teleport to your destination in just a few minutes."Okay. I will tell Ginny and the rest.""See you at eight thirty."oOoOoOo"Draco!" Someone yelled from outside his room. Draco was still sleeping and still hung over. He grunted and buried his head under the pillow.The door slammed open and Theo and Marcus entered."Damn, Draco." Theo whistled. "Look at this room." He kicked some bottles lying on the floor. "It's a lot messier than mine. Say, did you have another party I wasn't invited to?"Marcus looked around and took out his wand, placing all Hermione's "evidence" back inside the box, except for the book which was on top of the drawers. He made another flick with his wand and the room was clean once again."I had a solo party last night." Draco murmured under his pillow.Theo sat at the edge of the bed while Marcus opened the curtains letting in some light."You always have a solo party. You still have friends you know." Theo muttered. He pulled the pillow out of Draco's head. Draco groaned at the sudden brightness of his room."Shut the damn curtains." Draco demanded.Marcus folded his arms. "You have to go to work."Draco sighed and opened his one eye. "Are you my fucking mother?" He looked at Theo. "And you? My father?"Theo wrinkled his nose. "Another amnesia again, Draco? This is bad."Draco threw another pillow at Theo and covered his face with his arms."So what was all this mess about?" Marcus asked, leaning at the drawers.Draco groaned. "Leave me alone."Theo threw the pillow back at him. "Not unless you tell us what happened with the double date of the year."Draco sat back up and glared at Theo. "Who told you about that?"Theo looked smug. "I have my sources."Draco peered at Marcus. "Is that the reason why you both came here?"Theo and Marcus nodded. Draco lay back and covered himself with the mattress. "You guys are the worst."Theo chuckled. "Fine. If you won't say anything, I'll just assume things." He stood up and acted as if he was an investigator. Marcus sniggered.Theo rubbed his chin. "Based on what we saw just a few minutes ago…I say that the date went well. All of Hermione's stuff were scattered and there were a lot of bottles. Maybe Draco and Hermione came back here and drank a lot of whiskey while walking down the memory lane and then…" He turned to face the bed. "The bed looks all rumpled and undone and Draco is only wearing his boxers. I believe that they had…"Draco took his wand and pointed it at Theo. Theo became silent. Thought he was still talking, they can't hear what he was saying. Marcus laughed so hard that he fell on the floor. Blaise entered and saw what was happening before him. Theo was wrestling with Draco, looking furious but he wasn't making any sounds and Marcus was on the floor laughing with tears."What the fuck is happening here?"Theo rushed to Blaise and tried to talk but he couldn't hear anything. Theo rolled his eyes and pointed at Draco then his throat. Draco glanced at Blaise and acted that he doesn't know anything that Theo's accusing him of.Marcus finally pulled himself together and stood up. He told Blaise what happened and Blaise began to laugh. Draco rolled his eyes but his lips curled to a smirk."C'mon Drake, give Theo's voice back.""No.""If you don't give his voice back, it means what he said is true." Blaise smiled slyly.Draco groaned and pointed his wand at Theo."Do I have my voice back?" Theo grinned. "I have my sexy voice back. Finally." He turned to face Draco. "That's not cool Draco. You know I was just messing around."Draco glared at his friend. "You assumed that Hermione and I slept together. That's not cool either."Theo gave an exaggerated gasp. He pretended to look appalled. "You thought that was what I assumed? You have a dirty mind Draco. I was just about to say you and Hermione played tag together." His lips curved. "Unless of course…you were fantasizing about her. She's one hot babe. All blokes would fantasize about her gorgeous body, hell, I know I would."Draco was about to point his wand again but Theo ran out of his bedroom. Blaise and Marcus chuckled."I'll just assume you were about to attack Theo again because of his lame attempt to say that you just played tag with Hermione and not the fact that he said she's one hot babe and he would fantasize about her body." Marcus laughed and started to leave the room. He stopped midway. "Do you guys want coffee?"Blaise and Draco nodded. They heard Theo yell outside that he wanted one too. Marcus left the room and went straight to the kitchen.When Blaise and Draco were left alone, Draco pinched the bridge of his nose while closing his eyes shut. Blaise took the book on top of the drawers and went to the desk. He sat on the chair beside the desk. "Okay, Blaise. Say it.""What?" Blaise muttered."Oh I know you also wanted to ask what happened last night."Blaise smirked. "I do?"Draco opened his eyes and ran his hand through his very messy hair. "It was a disaster, alright? Happy?"Blaise shook his head gently. "You are a stubborn bastard with a fucked up mind.""Excuse me?""I know you know what I mean Draco."Draco folded his arms. "I'm sorry if I don't know what you mean by that statement."Blaise placed his right ankle on top of his left knee and began to open the book, A knight in Shining Armor. He closed it back again and placed it on top of the desk. "Do you always have to fight it? Do you need a flash sign showing who is the one? I mean… the real one?""No." Draco glared at his best friend. "Blaise, Andrew loves Hermione.""You love her too." Blaise stated, looking at his friend pointedly.Draco scoffed and looked away. "I do not.""And that's why you are a stubborn bastard with a fucked up mind.""Blaise." Draco warned."What? It's true. However…" Blaise stood up. "Again, it's not my place to tell. I know someone else has to tell you that. I smell the coffee. Get up."oOoOoOoIt was one in the afternoon and Hermione was still compiling the photos she's taken in a black portfolio. These were the pictures she really wanted to take. These were pictures of sceneries, nature, everything that surrounds her. It could be the traffic, the huge buildings, name it. She dreams of having a photography show and people will appreciate all her works.She has two hours left before she gets ready for the masked ball. Ginny told her she needed enough time to prepare. They would have some beauticians over at her flat at 3. They would have some facials, mani and pedi, hair and makeup done.Hermione's mind drifted to what Ginny said earlier. Her relationship with Draco had its ups and downs but they always made it through together. She doesn't want to give Draco up, that thought didn't even cross her mind. But, how much could her heart handle any more pain? Would she give in to what fate was telling her?Her mind was snapped back to reality when she heard her cell phone ring. She checked the screen and it was an unknown number. She frowned but still answered."Hello?""Hi Miss Granger. This is Ben Milner."She thought for a second, trying to recall who Ben Milner is. She remembered that Ben was the person who helped Draco during the accident. "Oh. Hi, Ben. How are you?""I'm fine, thank you for asking. Listen, I'm around and I was hoping if we could meet at Rico's Café for lunch?""Umm…" Hermione checked her watch. She still has enough time and she is hungry. "Sure. I'll be there in ten minutes.""Okay. Bye."When she pressed the end button of her phone, she forgot to ask where he got her number but then she remembered that she gave him her contact details the night of Draco's accident. She placed her phone inside her satchel and went out of her office. "Tell Gin I'll be having lunch at Rico's with Ben." She called out to Elena who nodded while talking to a client over the phone.oOoOoOoIt was difficult to spot Ben inside the bistro. It's been a while since Hermione's seen him. She looked around, the floors and ceiling was made of dark wood. There is heavy wooden furniture and velvet drapes. The bistro was packed of people but she liked this place a lot since she ate here many times and also this place is all warm and home-like. She craned her neck and saw a man waving at her. The man has a few gray hair highlighting his browns and was wearing a dark blue polo shirt which was tucked inside his beige slacks. She smiled when she realized it was Ben. She went to his direction. Ben was struggling to get up when Hermione quickly stopped him. "No. Please, just sit."Ben offered his hand instead. "It's nice to see you again Miss Granger."Hermione took his hand and shook it. She pulled her hand back again while she sat down. "It's nice to see you too Ben. Please call me Hermione.""Hermione." Ben repeated and smiled, showing small wrinkles at the corner of his eyes."How are you?" She began after waving at the waiter."I'm good. My wife, Linda is still with my daughter-in-law. My son and his wife had a baby girl." His eyes started to twinkle as he told her about his granddaughter. "She is a very beautiful angel."Hermione can't help but smile. The waiter came and handed them their menus. She scanned the menu "I'll have the Roast Cornish cod and red wine." She placed the menu down and glanced at Ben. "How about you, Ben? My treat.""Why thank you, Hermione. But we should order when everyone is here."She frowned. Everyone? Who else did he invite? "Who are we waiting for?" she asked, looking around the bistro.Ben's eyes begin to move past her shoulder, his lips started to curve. He raised his hand and waved at someone, the same way he did to her. Hermione shifted from her sit to see who it was and saw Draco just two steps away from her.oOoOoOoIt was obvious that Draco felt the same way as Hermione did. They both looked like they've seen a ghost. Yes, they saw each other last night but it didn't quite end well, scratch that, it was a disaster. She found it hard to look at him right now especially after Andrew professed his love for her, even though she knew that Andrew only did that to annoy Draco, but still, Draco didn't know that and he didn't care.She looked away and fixed her eyes at the menu which was resting on top of the table.Ben gestured Draco to sit down which was the chair opposite Hermione. Once Draco was seated, Ben gave him a pat on the shoulder. "How are you Draco?""I'm good. You?" His tone sounded business-like."Very well, thank you.""Have you ordered already?" Draco looked at Ben then took a quick glance at Hermione, who was still looking at the menu.Ben shook his head. "We were just waiting for you before we order."Draco shifted on his seat and glanced at Hermione. "Hermione knows about this lunch?"Hermione's head jerked up but she was looking past his shoulder. "No. I don't know about this."Ben's brows knotted. Something was off between the young couple. Maybe they had a misunderstanding last night or this morning. Ben thought."I called her Draco. I called her after I called you. I wanted to see how you two were."Draco was confused with what he was feeling right now. Somehow, he felt nervous yet happy at the same time that Hermione is here with him. He truly believes that his mind and his heart really disagree on a lot of things. But if someone were to ask him what he really felt right now that Hermione is just in front of him, he would say that he felt right. Right in a way that he feels at home, warm and comfortable.His friend's visit apparently gave him a breath of fresh air. His mind wandered back to what Theo said about Hermione's body. He swallowed. Hermione really has a great body but he doesn't bloody fantasize about her, well, he doesn't think about it that much…he doesn't think about it every day…maybe some days a week. He blinked a few times, feeling his cheek burn. What the hell am I thinking about? He knew that they may have slept together before but that doesn't mean he wanted to…He swallowed again. He shook his head slightly to clear his disturbing thoughts.Speaking of his friends, he was feeling great now that they are in good terms again. Even after Blaise called him a stubborn bastard, which, he still doesn't understand why Blaise called him that, they had a great chat over coffee. They didn't even mention about Astoria or the masked ball tonight.Ben's call surprised him but he really did want to talk to Ben some time about what happened. It was a perfect time to be away from work. He didn't feel like working today either because of what had happened last night. Thanks to Andrew's confession that he still loves Hermione, it kept him awake all night not until he finished seven bottles of whiskey. The truth is, he didn't really not care. It fucking tore Draco's heart. Draco just said that he didn't care so that Hermione would finally go to Andrew. He doesn't want Hermione to hold on to him because he doesn't know how to make Hermione happy. He doesn't know if he could love her the way she does to him. It is better to let Hermione be with someone who knows how to love her.He knew he finally pushed her away because as of this moment, though he felt 'right' in here with her now, he felt that Hermione is now very distant to him…cold even.oOoOoOo"Thank you for the meal." Ben smiled warmly at both Hermione and Draco. "So, is there any date set for your wedding?"Hermione almost choked from her glass of water. Draco glanced at her and offered his handkerchief. She refused but he insisted so she took it and wiped her nose. She gave it back to him and their fingers brushed slightly. He moved his eyes at her and she was just looking back at Ben like nothing happen, like she didn't feel the electricity when their fingers touched. "There won't be any wedding." He heard Hermione say.Hermione pause and made a mental mantra to her head that she should refrain from looking at Draco but she could see from her peripherals that Draco was staring right at her. She gave a small smile. "We're just friends now."Ben smiled sadly at her then looked at Draco, whose gaze was still fixed at Hermione. Draco felt his throat dry and found it difficult to swallow. The word 'just friends' still buzzing on his head. Another image flashed through his mind."If you don't mind, may I ask what happened?" Ben placed his arms on top of the table.She bit her bottom lip. She doesn't know where to start or even tell what happened knowingly that Draco is just in front of her. Draco clenched his jaw. He can't find his voice to speak."We just grew apart." Hermione mumbled.Ben jerked his head towards Draco but wouldn't say anything else. He shouldn't pry. Besides, he would never understand young couples nowadays.Hermione looked everywhere but Draco. The bistro seemed to get smaller and smaller. The tension rising and she felt her heart beat fast. She could also feel his intense gaze at her right now. She heard Draco's cell phone ring. He mumbled something incoherent and excused himself.When Draco was out of earshot, Ben leaned closer at Hermione and took her hand, squeezing it gently before letting it go again. "I don't believe you both grew apart. I could still see how much he loves you and you him."Hermione took a sip from her glass. "We grew apart and as much as I appreciate what you said, I don't believe that he still loves me."Ben looked down at the table to think for a while. "I am forty nine years old. My wife and I were married twenty five years ago and we still learn something new about each other. If we have differences, we embrace it and accept it. It didn't make us grow apart. It made us grow old together. Though we've been through a lot, I still love my wife even after all these years." He paused. "If I love my wife for all those years, it's safe to say I know what love looks like and I can see it in both of you. I know because I've seen my children in love too. Draco won't admit his feelings for you. I've only known him for a while but I know how stubborn he could be." His lips curved. He remembered the time when Draco won't listen to him when Draco was trying to reach out for his phone during the accident.Hermione chose to be silent. Draco is a different man now. If he really does love her, it would take years for him to admit it. She loves him and she's willing to wait for him but she hopes her heart could still take it. She cleared her throat. "Say, Ben, How do you forget your past love?"Ben raised his brows, knowing well what she meant. "Do you want to forget your past love?"She sighed and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She looked down at her fingers then back at Ben. "I don't. But I have to. It's hard to –" Her voice started to break her eyes filling up with tears. "It's hard to love someone who does nothing but push you away and tells you that they don't care about you."Ben looked down at his clasped hands on top of the table. "I've heard somewhere that if you want to forget your past love, you have to find someone new to love. You have to commit to that new love and merge yourself into it. If that new love is real, then your previous love will become the past." He leaned back to his chair. "Hermione, remember, you find new love not because you want to forget, but you can forget because of that new love." He glanced at her, his eyes soft. "Stop crying. I know you don't want to forget about Draco. I know you still love him. Keep in mind that things have to be difficult before you finally reach true happiness."Hermione nodded and wiped the corner of her eyes with her hand. "Yeah. I promised myself that I won't cry anymore." She giggled through tears. "I've been breaking that promise a lot. I love him, but I don't know." She gave a one arm shrug. "I don't know how long could I still hold on."Ben gave a half smile. He knew that Draco was back a few minutes now and was listening to them from a distance. Draco was stiff and frowning all the way back to their table.When he was seated, he waved his hand to call the waiter and asked for the bill. He glanced at Ben. "Are you staying at a hotel?""No. I'll be heading back to my son's house.""I'll give you a ride home.""It's okay, Draco. You should bring Hermione back to her work. I've got a lot of time and she has to head back to work as soon as possible."Draco nodded but Hermione shook her head. "It's you who needs the ride, Ben. I still have time."Ben looked at Draco then at Hermione. "I'm fine. Draco agreed to take you back. Go ahead."Hermione bit her lip. This is going nowhere. Ben eyed Draco and cocked his head slightly at Hermione's direction.Draco clenched his fist under the table. "I'm bringing you back to your studio, Hermione."Hermione looked past his shoulder, still avoiding his eyes. "No. I can handle myself. Go and call your driver so that Ben could go home early. I could walk my way back to the studio."Ben placed his finger on his lips, trying to hide his smile as he watched the two. Neither one of them would back down. They are both stubborn."I don't have a driver anymore. I drive on my own." Draco said out of the blue.This time, Hermione looked into his eyes. Draco's throat got caught up. "Really? Are you ready to drive again?" She asked, trying to sound like it was nothing but the concern in her voice rang clear.He smirked. "I just drove my way to work and here. Wait, is that the reason why you don't want me to bring you back to the studio? You're afraid?"She shook her head. "I didn't know you drive your own car again but even if I knew, I wouldn't be afraid."Draco smiled. "Good to know you trust my driving skills.""I always trust in everything you do." She said before even realizing that she said it out loud.Draco smiled warmly at her which made her blush.Hermione noticed that they were talking again and having a normal conversation. She began to feel butterflies fluttering in her stomach but then it faded as soon as she realized that it won't last long. This conversation with Draco would only be another memory. It was obvious that Draco wasn't happy that she was having lunch with him. He kept giving her mixed signals that only confuse her more. Draco would be like this at one point then all annoyed in another. If this is how it's going to be, then she would prefer that he would be entertaining later at the masked ball.She stood up, taking her satchel with her. She turned to face Ben. "It was really nice to see you Ben. I hope we could have lunch another time. Say hi to Linda for me. Bye."Before Ben could answer, she fleeted quickly out of the Bistro. Ben glanced at Draco. "Don't throw a chance to love a person who really loves you because not every person has the ability of loving you seriously."Draco looked quizzically at Ben, who, in return, cocked his head to the side. "Well?"Draco scowled and stood up. The waiter came to their table and handed him the bill. Draco placed a hefty amount at the table and went outside the Bistro. He doesn't know why he left the bistro to run after her. He doesn't know why he wanted Hermione to stay with him longer. He doesn't know why he likes talking to her. He doesn't know why hearing that she trusts him made his heart melt. He doesn't know why he felt like he was punched in the gut when he saw her kissing Andrew.oOoOoOoAnother image crossed Draco's mind. He was inside a car and watching a similar image of Andrew and Hermione kissing but then it disappeared when he felt someone push past him.Draco wanted to go to them and push Andrew away. He wanted to punch him a dozen of times but he felt like his feet were glued to the floor. He remembered what he heard a while ago during Hermione and Ben's conversation. After the call from Astoria, informing him about the final preparations for the ball, he heard everything beginning from the part where Hermione asked Ben how to forget her past love. He felt his eyes begin to fill up with hot tears. He knew well that he was the past love Hermione was referring to and Andrew is the new love. Does it mean that she's finally moved on? I should be happy, right? I should be happy because this is what I wanted. I pushed her away…but why do I feel like I want to have her back?Draco's tears began to flow slowly on his cheeks. The memory of what he heard earlier repeated on his mind. "Hermione, remember, you find new love not because you want to forget, but you can forget because of that new love."He wiped the tears on his face and composed himself. He didn't know why he felt that way. He turned around and left, not glancing back at the two.oOoOoOo"Why did you kiss me?" Andrew pulled away."I wanted an answer to my question." Hermione breathed."I hope it isn't answered yet so we could do it all over again." Andrew smirked. She playfully slapped his arm."So what were you asking yourself?" He was really curious."I can't tell.""But did I answer it correctly?" He sounded hopeful.She looked up at him then back at the road.The truth is, she wanted to know if she would feel differently when she kissed Andrew again. They had their first-last goodbye kiss before but she didn't feel anything. Now that she knew about Andrew's promise and what he did for her, she would try if anything changed. She felt nothing. She didn't feel what she felt whenever she kisses Draco. Kissing Andrew was different. It was sweet and longing but not as passionate, warm and heart melting like Draco's. If having a new love was the key to forget Draco, if she decides to, then maybe, just maybe, she would give Andrew his chance. It may be unfair for Andrew to use him to forget Draco but it's her only way to move on.Andrew placed his arm around her shoulder and they headed back to the studio."Elena told me." Andrew said. "That's why I know where you are. I just wanted to see you before I pick you up.""I had lunch with Ben.""Ben?""The one who helped Draco when he had his accident.""Oh.""I had lunch with Ben and Draco."Andrew was quiet. Once they reached the studio, he opened the door for her and let her enter first. But when Hermione was half way inside the studio, Andrew called her. "Hermione, I have to go. I still have to answer some calls from New York."She nodded and waved goodbye closing the door of her studio.Andrew took a few steps away from the studio. He knew what that kiss was about. He doesn't have legilimens, mind you, but he just knew. He smiled sadly. He could never compete with Draco in Hermione's heart. But even though he would never win, he would still keep his promise that he would stay beside her no matter what.oOoOoOoA/N: Part 2 coming right up. Please review this chapter also. Thanks! I really had to cut this chapter cause I had to edit and re-edit the other half. I love Andrew too but I love Draco more. May I ask which actor reminds you of Andrew? Andrew has dark brown hair and blue eyes. I'll say who mine is in the part two of this chapter.

A/N: Nice choices everyone! I did picture Ian Somerhalder as Andrew! Anyway, thanks for the AWESOME REVIEWS. This is Part 2… and finally the end! Hope you enjoy. Please review.oOoOoOo"You need to sign here, here and here." Mr. Heindrichs pointed at the pages needed to be sign."Is everything in place?" Draco asked while signing the papers."Yes. A car would bring you and Astoria at your destination tomorrow at eight in the morning.""Good.""Is this what you really want?"oOoOoOo"Is this what you really want?" Ginny raised her brow at the dress that Hermione chose to wear for tonight."Yes. Why?" Hermione frowned.They were both having their nails done while their faces were covered with green masks. The beauticians were very prompt and proceeded immediately to work on Hermione and Ginny as soon as they reached their flat."I like the other one." Ginny pointed at the other dress hanging on the rack. Hermione thought for a minute. "Yeah. That's better." She told the person in charge of her makeup and hairstyle about the change of dress. They sighed in relief and nodded in approval to the new dress she was going to wear."I had lunch with Ben and Draco.""How did it go?" Ginny asked."It was a pleasant lunch. I had to bail once Draco and I started talking.""Why?""To avoid." Hermione shrugged one shoulder."Hm?" Ginny muttered telling her to elaborate what she said."To avoid any heart aches. I know it won't last. He kept giving me mixed signals. It's confusing. So I had to stop it before it happens again.""You go girl." The beautician who was doing her nails said.Hermione waved her other hand, the one which was newly painted with nail polish. "One day he's the old Draco, then after that, he goes back being the cold Draco. I just wanted to avoid that. I need him to be the old Draco tonight.""Men. They change faster than the weather. We'll make sure you're a jaw-dropping babe for the ball tonight." The makeup artist muttered. "That Draco guy will beg you to go back to him."Ginny giggled. "What do you think would happen later?"Hermione looked at her friend then back at the ceiling. "I don't know. But I'm hoping it would turn out fine."oOoOoOo"There you are. What took you so long? Everything looks great." Astoria gave him a kiss on the cheek."I had lunch with Ben.""Who?" Astoria asked without looking at him. She was busy watching the organizers set everything up."Ben. The guy I told you about who saved my life.""Oh. Yes, yes dear." Astoria took his arm and led him in the middle of the ballroom. "But we'll talk about that later. Look at this. It's beautiful, isn't it?"Draco didn't look around instead, he asked one waiter, who was setting up the tables for a glass of champagne. He was still feeling the pain after seeing Hermione and Andrew kissing."Well?" Astoria faced him raising her brow.He looked at her and she waved around their surroundings."It's great. You did a good job?" He said in a flat voice."Good job? I did an excellent job." She waved her had ignoring his negativity. She wants a positive vibe until later so she wouldn't be frowning the whole night. "I just want everything to be perfect. I can't wait to tell them our plans." Her eyes glint in excitement. She turned to face him. "I better get ready now. You should too." She reached up to kiss him on the lips but Draco turned his head so she kissed his cheek instead.Astoria frowned, watching Draco who was still not looking at her. She opened her mouth to ask him what was wrong when the event organizer walked up to her and said that the flowers arrived. Astoria left Draco and went with the event organizer. The waiter came back and gave Draco a glass of champagne."Are you alright Sir Draco?" Sara asked. Sara is the woman who took care of the mansion. She is in her forty's and one of the many people who raised Draco. She has always been like a mother to him.Draco downed his glass and glanced at Sara. His eyes searched hers as if he was looking for an answer. "I don't know how I feel anymore."Sara placed her hand on his arm. "You don't know or you know but won't believe it?"Sara knew that Draco has amnesia. Though he has amnesia, she raised him for years so she knew that something was bothering Draco. She saw how he was doing right now and what worries her is that he looks unhappy. She knew the difference between the relationship of Draco and Hermione and the one he is having right now with Astoria. Sara prefers Draco with Hermione because he was never miserable like this.Before Draco replied, Astoria came back. She placed her hand on his face "The flowers are beautiful. I'll go up now. See you later." She whispered.oOoOoOo"See you later." Ginny muttered and pressed the end button of her cell phone. She turned to face Hermione. "It was Harry. He'll come over in thirty minutes.""Andrew will be here the same time. " Hermione stood and traced her dress, which was hanging on the rack, with her fingers. She was still wearing a white silk robe but her hair and makeup are finished. She now has a side fringe and her hair is styled in a loose mid-shaft waves. Her eyes have a brown, dramatic smokey-eye makeup and her lips are in soft pink. Her fingers moved to trace her half, Venetian style golden mask decorated with Swarovski crystals. It doesn't need any ribbon to hold it in place because it was magically designed to fit whoever wears it. She looked at Ginny and smiled. Ginny smiled back.Ginny was wearing her silk robe too and her hair was in soft waves swept in one side. Her eyes have a simple makeup with eye liner and her lips were in dark red. "You look beautiful, Hermione, even when you're just wearing a robe." Ginny took her dress hanging on another rack. "Sucks for Draco for letting you slip away."Hermione half smiled and took her dress out of the rack too. "You look beautiful too Gin. I only hope Draco would notice me later.""Of course he'll notice you." Ginny said in a louder voice. She waved her hands at Hermione. "Who wouldn't notice that?"Hermione giggled and turned to face the mirror, her smile fading. "I need to talk to him, even for the last time. I have to tell him everything."Ginny walked up to her and placed her hand on Hermione's shoulder. "You will. Trust me."oOoOoOoHarry's jaw dropped when he saw Ginny. She was wearing a full length strapless sweetheart formal black dress that features her figure and designed with black sparkling beaded accents from front to back. Her hair, which was in long waves, were swept on her right shoulder, were soft and shiny. For her accessories, she is wearing diamond earrings and a gold cuff on her right wrist. For her feet, she is wearing black sandals. Harry didn't look bad himself. His hair was neat on one side and looked handsome wearing his black coat and tie. He handed Ginny her mask. It is also a half mask, which has sophisticated designs and diamond accents. It has a small stick on the side to hold it up. "You look stunning, love." Harry murmured in Ginny's ear while snaking his arm around her waist. She gave him a sweet kiss on his lips."Where's Hermione?" Andrew asked, his blue eyes twinkling in excitement. He looked very expensive in his black tuxedo and bow tie. His brown hair is still neat but messy at the same time. He stood tall and looked very confident."She's coming down now." Ginny smiled.As if on cue, Hermione slowly walked down the stairs. Andrew looked at her in awe. Hermione was wearing a classic long flowing, one shoulder white dress. It has a shirred bust with sweetheart bodice and a glittering one should strap that wraps around the bust to a cut out back, showing some skin of her back. The long, flowing skirt has a front slit that flatters her long slender legs. For her accessories, she is wearing a pearl diamond stud earrings and a platinum gold bracelet on her left wrist. For her feet, she is wearing white, one-strap, four inch heels. She was holding her silver clutch bag on her right hand and her mask on the left."Hermione." He breathed.Hermione was just one step higher than him so they were face to face. Andrew took her hand, never leaving his eyes on hers, and kissed it. "You're so beautiful. I'm honored to be your date for this ball."Hermione blushed and bit her bottom lip. "Thank you. You look beautiful too." They both stared at each other for a minute when they heard Harry clear his throat."We have to go now." Harry raised his brow. "Unless we'll just stay here…I'm okay with that."Ginny gave him a look but Harry shrugged.Andrew smirked and offered his arm, which Hermione gladly took. She looked around. "Where's Ron?""Ron would meet us there. Lavander is still getting ready." Harry looked at her apologetically."It's okay. Let's go?" She looked up at Andrew. "Where are your masks?" She moved her eyes to Harry.Andrew placed his hand on his side. "It's in my pocket. Magic." He gave his boyish smile which made Hermione blush.Ginny asked Harry where his mask is and he said the same thing. Andrew led Hermione outside while Ginny and Harry trailed behind them. Andrew's driver opened the car of the limo for them. Once they were settled inside, the car started to move and drive to the airport.oOoOoOoTheir way to the airport was quiet. Hermione was nervous the moment she rode the limousine and riding the TelevPort didn't give her enough time to calm her nerves down. Once the door of the TelevPort opened, they were in another airport. She frowned because she thought they would be in Abraxas Mansion. She looked up at Andrew. Andrew smiled down at her. "You need time to calm those nerves down and I want to arrive there in style." Andrew winked at her.They stepped out the TelevPort and they saw two white Bentleys. Andrew raised his one finger at Hermione and he darted towards the two men who were standing in each car. They were both in black shirt, coat and slacks. Andrew shook both their hands and talked to them. They both nodded and Andrew went back to where Hermione, Ginny and Harry stood. "Harry, you and Ginny would ride one while Hermione and I would ride the other."Harry nodded and both he and Ginny went their way to the car. Andrew placed his hand on the small back of Hermione, feeling her smooth skin on his palm, and led her to the other Bentley. She was greeted by another driver who looks like someone with a Hispanic descent. He tipped his hat to greet them and opened the door. She melted inside the car seat so did Andrew. The driver closed the door gently and went to the driver's seat. They started to drive their way to the mansion.oOoOoOoHermione tapped her fingers nervously on her lap. She watched the view outside the car window. She remembers all the times when Draco brought her here and she remembered the last time she came here and Andrew was with them. Her mind started to drift to what will happen later. She tried to think of ways on how she could talk to Draco or what would she say to him. Where should she start? She closed her eyes briefly and suddenly, she felt warm hands cover hers. She opened her eyes and looked down at her now covered hands. She turned to face Andrew and he gave her a reassuring smile. "I'm here…always."Hermione forced a smile and looked back out the window. She could see the huge mansion from afar and her pulse began beating rapidly. Andrew gripped her hands tighter. "Everything would be alright. Breathe." She nodded, fixing her gaze on the mansion and let out a huge sigh.Harry and Ginny stepped out first and there were different flashes of light from the photographers. They both stopped to pose for some photographers and proceeded inside. The Bentley where Andrew and Hermione rode was next. Someone opened the car for them and Andrew stepped out first. He offered his hand and Hermione took it while she stepped out of the car. The flashes of light were blinding but she managed to smile. Andrew placed his arm around her waist and guided her towards the double doors. There was one photographer who asked them to pose. Hermione smiled at the camera while Andrew gazed at her longingly. He planted a soft kiss on her temple and the photographers went wild taking picture after picture of the two. After a few minutes, Andrew led Hermione inside the mansion.Hermione looked up at him, expecting him to explain what happened but instead of talking, he took the mask on her hand and placed it on her face. He took his mask and wore it. It was a black mask and even though half of his face was covered, his handsome face is still noticeable. His mask didn't hide his very blue eyes. He took her hand and kissed her knuckles gently. He placed her hand back to his arm and they entered the grand ballroom.This would probably be the last time I would spend time with Hermione. Before the night ends…I know that she would be with Draco again. Andrew thought. I will miss her.Astoria did a great job. The ballroom looked very elegant and sophisticated. There were black and white accents around the ballroom. The ceiling was magically turned into the night sky and there were shooting stars. The tables where in white linen cloth and the centerpiece for each table was a black crystal vase with white roses. There were also black and white expensive table settings. There were waiters moving around with trays of finger foods and glasses of champagne. There was also beautiful music and lights surrounding them. All guests were wearing black or white and women had different designs of their gowns. Everyone was wearing their masks, even the waiters, usherettes and musicians.Deep inside the ballroom, she immediately spotted Harry, Ginny, Ron and Lavander. Ron was wearing a gray shirt and black coat and tie. Lavander was wearing a white knee length dress that fitted her figure perfectly. They were all wearing their masks. Hermione could hear soft whispers of people who were watching them enter and there were people nodding in approval. Her eyes wandered around until she finally spotted the only person she was looking for.oOoOoOoDraco was wearing a black tuxedo and a bow tie just like Andrew. He was wearing a silver mask that covers half his face. It was like the mask of the Phantom of the Opera. Beside him was Astoria. She was wearing a strapless black gown that has an A-line floor length skirt. It has beaded silver and emerald accents in the front and back. Her hair is teased and pulled back in an updo hairstyle. She was wearing emerald dangling earrings and a black lace half mask with emerald stones designs in it.They were both talking to three people. One was a big but short man who has receding white hair, another was a woman with strawberry blonde hair and was tall and skinny and the last one was another man with copper hair who looks like Draco's age.Draco kept on his Malfoy façade. He talked to all their guests but his mind is really thinking about one certain guest. He doesn't know if he could bear to see Andrew and Hermione together in a few minutes. Hell, he doesn't even know if he could pretend that he didn't see anything a while ago. It hurts a lot. He thought that hearing Andrew's love for Hermione hurts, but seeing them kiss has been the worst. Another blurry image flashed through his mind.He froze; he could feel that Hermione is around. He doesn't know why he could feel that she's here but he does. He turned his head to the side and his throat got caught up at the sight before him.oOoOoOoThat's When I Knew – Alicia KeysDraco saw Hermione talking to Ginny. He knew it was Ginny because of the hair and he knew it was Hermione, well, because…because she's your Hermione. He heard a voice at the back of his head. Where the bloody hell did that come from? He thought.She was stunning. She looked like she's a goddess sent from above. Her dress looks perfectly on her. He found it hard to breath. He was lost at words. No words could justify how beautiful Hermione is. All men are looking at her now. Draco's eyes moved to the man beside her and sneered. Andrew has his hands on Hermione's waist. Draco wanted to take those hands off her. He narrowed his eyes and felt his feet move when he felt someone grab his arm. He turned his face and saw it was Astoria's. Even though she was still talking to Charlotte, the woman who is tall and skinny, she continued to grip her hand tighter to his arm."Is that Andrew Richards?" Charlotte said.All heads turned, also Astoria."My, my, does he look very handsome." Charlotte fanned herself."Who is his date?" Eric, the man with copper hair asked, pointing at Hermione."That's Hermione. Hermione Granger." Draco muttered, his eyes never leaving on Hermione.Eric looked like he remembers something. "Oh. That's Hermione Granger? The Hermione Granger? Wow, she looks beautiful.""They look perfect together." Charlotte nodded.Draco took Astoria's hand and removed it from his arm. "Excuse me." He took long strides away from the ballroom; Astoria excused herself and trailed behind him.When they were out of the ballroom and away from the guests, Astoria took Draco's arm. "What the bloody hell was that about?"Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. "I just needed some air.""Don't tell me you are feeling something for Hermione."Draco didn't answer."She's with Andrew now." Astoria glowered. "Don't you get it? She's moved on.""I don't want to talk about this now." Draco growled, pulling his arm away.Astoria closed her eyes and took long deep breathes. "Okay. I'm sorry. But we have to meet some guests." She took a step closer to him. She placed her right hand on his face. "Draco, love, I'm here. We will continue with our plans and we'll be far away from the people who are hurting you. As soon as this party is over, we could move on and forget all the people who caused us pain." She forced Draco to look at her and he did. "Okay?"Draco nodded and sighed. He took her wrist and pulled it down. He went back to the ballroom. Astoria followed.oOoOoOoWhen Draco and Astoria were once again inside the ballroom, Violet and some other fashion designers started to talk to Astoria. Draco excused himself and chose to talk with Heindrichs and Philippe but before he could reach them he was stopped by Theo. "Hey man, great party."Draco smirked and took another glass of champagne from a tray. "Where are the others?"Theo shrugged. "I really couldn't tell with these masks on."Draco rolled his eyes until he spotted Blaise and Pansy. Pansy gave him a kiss on the cheek. "I've missed you Draco."Draco smiled at Pansy. "I'm sorry if I haven't been around. How is Carlos?"Pansy smirked. "Well, if only you would come and visit more often…Carlos doesn't know who his godfather is."Draco took a sip from his glass. "I'll visit him one time, I promise."Blaise gave a small pat on Draco's shoulder. "What is this party all about anyway?"Draco drank all the contents of his glass and gave it to the waiter. "Astoria prefers to let everyone know about it all together."Blaise snorted. "Really?""I really don't care. I just want to get it over with so I could get the hell away from here."Blaise shook his head. "Still stubborn bastard."Pansy gave Blaise a look. Blaise just shrugged. "He deserves it."Theo craned his head around. "Say, did you see Hermione? She's very beautiful Drake."Draco glared at Theo. "Don't start."Theo chuckled and slung his arm on Draco's shoulder. "I know the feeling, all blokes here – including me, are very jealous of Andrew. Sucks that it's Andrew who's in her arms right now."Draco scowled at Theo. "Are you really calling for your death bed right now?"Theo pulled his arm away and raised both his arms up. "Hey, I'm not the one who let her slip away.""Theo." Pansy warned but they could see her lips curve. She glanced at Draco. "He's just teasing Draco."Blaise sniggered. "That's why Draco is the stubborn bastard with a fucked up mind."Draco smirked. He would just ignore his friend's statements. His night is already ruined and he doesn't want to make a scene. He turned on his heel and heard Blaise and Theo said their boo's. Draco pushed himself past some of his guests when he felt someone bump to him. He glanced to the side and realized it was Andrew.oOoOoOo"Draco." Andrew nodded curtly."Andrew.""Have you seen my date tonight?" Andrew looked smug."I did.""Beautiful, isn't she?"Draco gritted his teeth. "She is.""Jealous?" Andrew smirked."No.""Good.""Happy?" Draco raised his brow.Andrew sighed and gave out a huge grin. "Very. You?"Draco sneered at him and left. This night is just getting worst every minute.oOoOoOoDinner and dessert was finished. The food was divine and everything matched starting from the appetizers down to the dessert. The music started and the tables were moved to give enough space to dance. Harry and Ron led their ladies to the middle of the dance floor. Hermione saw Blaise and Pansy dancing and also Marcus with Parvati. Theo was also with another woman who looked like a model.Hermione was able to talk to Draco's friends a while ago and they said that Draco got drunk the night after their double date. It broke Hermione's heart to hear what they said. It made her realize that perhaps he did care. He was hurt at what Andrew said. Does it mean that somehow, Draco might have some feelings for her?Andrew stood up beside her and offered his hand. "May I have this dance?"Hermione was pulled back from reality when she heard Andrew's voice. She forced a smile and placed her hand gently on his. They waltzed to the middle of the dance floor. Andrew placed his other hand on the small of her back and pulled her a little closer to him. They moved slowly to the music. Hermione looked up at him, he smiled. She loves Andrew but she isn't in love with him. She's still in love with Draco and she has a feeling that Draco is finally feeling the same way."Galleon for your thoughts?" Andrew muttered.Hermione shook her head. "It's nothing." She paused. "Andrew, thank you.""For what?""For always being there for me.""You don't need to thank me.""I do."Andrew turned her around and once again pulled her closer to him. "I know, Hermione. I know how you feel about me. And I know that it isn't the same way as you feel for Draco. But I understand. I do. So don't worry."Hermione bit her lip and felt hot tears to form in her eyes. She thanked Ginny for casting a spell at her makeup so whatever happens, it won't get messed up or melt.She felt sorry for Andrew. All he ever did was to be there for her and pick up the broken pieces of her heart. He always stood beside her during her worst.She leaned her head on his chest hearing the beat of his heart. No matter how hard she tries to tell her heart to pick Andrew, it won't listen. Her heart already belongs to someone else but Andrew's heart is screaming out her name."I love you Hermione." He whispered in a very soft voice that Hermione didn't hear it. He pulled away a little and placed on a huge smile. "Hey. Cheer up. You need to loosen up those nerves before you talk to Draco."The music changed into a much happier tune. Hermione knew it was called "Save the Last Dace for Me." Andrew stretched their arms and twirled Hermione and made low dip. Hermione giggled. Andrew stood back up with Hermione and continued to dance. "There's the smile I always want to see."oOoOoOoDraco was drinking another glass of champagne. Astoria couldn't wait for him to ask her to dance so she decided to dance with Damien, one of her old friend who lives in France. Draco scowled at Andrew and Hermione as he watched them laughing and dancing. He asked the waiter for another glass of champagne when someone else sat on an empty chair beside him. He turned his head to the side and groaned in frustration."Malfoy.""Potter.""How come you remember me and you don't remember Hermione?" Harry took a glass from a waiter passing by."Selective memory loss." Draco drawled. "That's what the muggle doctor said.""Of all people who you should've forgotten, you've chosen Hermione. I would much prefer if you don't remember me anymore." Harry took a sip from his glass.Draco snorted. "Believe me, I would love to forget about your existence."Harry chuckled and downed his glass. "Glad to know the feeling is mutual." He placed his glass down on the table. "I don't know what the fuck she sees in you."Draco emptied his glass and slammed it to the table. "I've been asking the same thing since I woke up in that damn hospital.""I don't like you for Hermione.""Who does?""Just shut up Malfoy. You told me that you would never give up on her. You also said that if you failed her once again, I could give you a hex or the avada kedavra." The corner of Harry's lips curved.Draco glanced at Harry and raised his brow. He said that? He saw another image, this time it was clear. He remembers talking to Harry about something."It was very tempting that time but you said none of those things would hurt you because the only thing that could crush or kill you is Hermione's rejection. I asked myself, what's the point of a hex, a crucio or the avada kedavra if it won't punish or hurt you?" Harry looked down at his hands then at Draco. His face was serious. "Hermione never rejected you no matter how much you failed her." Harry shut his fists tightly. "I wanted so much to give you the unforgivable."Draco smirked and opened his arms wide. "Then by all means, do it now."Harry's mouth formed into a thin line. He was stopping himself from getting his wand on his pocket. He shook his head slightly. "No." He stood up slowly. "I won't do it. It would just hurt Hermione."Draco snorted. "You're just a coward."Harry took Draco's shirt and pulled him closer. Draco just looked bored. Harry glared at him for a few minutes then let him go, pushing him back to his seat. The ballroom was dark and the only light was in the dance floor, which was dim, so no one saw them. Harry straightened his coat. He decided to leave Draco alone. It's Hermione who should be confronting Draco right now and not him. He turned on his heel when he heard Draco speak. "I guess I'm already dead."Harry glanced back at him and frowned. Draco wasn't looking at Harry but at Hermione and Andrew. Harry smirked. "Malfoy giving up? Now this is a Kodak moment."Draco moved his eyes at Harry. "Code- what?"Harry snorted and continued to walk away. "You're stupid, Malfoy."Draco continued to frown and glanced back at Hermione. He stood up and found his feet leading him to the dance floor.Sara, who was wearing a black and white mask, saw Draco and where he was heading to. She excused herself from the person she was dancing with and decided to go where Andrew and Hermione are before Draco reaches them.oOoOoOo"Do you mind if I steal your partner for a while?" An old woman said, wearing a black and white mask. Hermione turned her head and nodded. "It's okay."Andrew smirked and bowed gently to the woman, offering his hand. The woman took it and they started to dance. Hermione turned her heel and walked back to their table. She tried to push herself from all the other people dancing. She bumped hard into someone and when she looked up, she saw it was Draco. He was wearing a half silver mask like the one in the Phantom of the Opera. She mumbled her excuses and turned to leave. He tried to reach out to her, tried to call her when an image flashed through his mind.It was an image where he was surrounded with shattered glass. He was trying to reach out for his cell phone. He was trying to say something… He knew it was a name. What was I trying to say?Draco looked at the fleeting back of Hermione when he felt someone take his arm. He looked down and saw it was Astoria. "We have to make the announcement now, love." She tugged his arm. Draco looked back to where he last saw Hermione, but he couldn't see her anymore.oOoOoOoHermione mentally smacked herself. She should've talked to Draco. That was her bloody chance for Merlin's sake. Once she saw him and gaze at his gray eyes, she felt like her heart was in her throat. She was lost at words. The things she planned to tell him were gone and even if she's just standing near the doors to the patio right now, she can't recall her prepared 'speech' when she had the chance to talk to Draco.She took a glass of champagne and downed it in one swift. Now she'll never find another chance to talk to Draco before the night ends.oOoOoOo"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please?" Astoria said, pointing her wand at her throat so her voice is much louder. Draco was standing beside her putting back on his Malfoy façade. All the guests turned their heads to the small stage where Astoria and Draco were.Andrew and Sara stopped dancing and turned to face the stage. Ginny and Harry were standing behind them.Astoria smiled. "I know all of you don't know why Draco and I threw a party." She paused. "Well, this is actually a farewell party for me and Draco."There were soft whispers from the guests. Hermione felt her hair prickle and her hands and feet turned cold. Andrew craned his head to search for Hermione and when he spotted her, he took long strides to her direction."Yes." Astoria muttered. "Draco and I decided to move to America. I would move my clothing line there and Draco with his company."There was applause but Hermione couldn't hear anything. She kept her gaze at Draco waiting for him to look at her and say that it was a joke but he didn't look at her nor did he say anything.Andrew took her clutch and led her out of the grand ballroom and out to the patio. Hermione was still shocked with the news. She found it hard to breath. "Hermione, breathe. Don't break down here."Ginny went out of the patio, Harry, Ron, Theo, Blaise, Marcus, Pansy followed. Hermione turned to face them; her lips trembling, she started to run far away from the patio. Andrew ran after her. The rest were supposed to follow but Ginny stopped them. "We should make sure that Astoria won't notice anything. This is between them. Someone should distract Astoria."Pansy nodded. "I'll do that. Blaise, you go and make sure to talk to Draco."Ginny told the rest to go inside. She told them to act like nothing happened. They shouldn't show Astoria the benefit that the victory is hers. Draco needed to talk to Hermione and the only way Draco could be away from Astoria, is when Astoria is distracted.oOoOoOo"Hermione. Wait!" Andrew ran as fast as he could. He took her arm and turned her, pulling her to him. Hermione sobbed. She was still wearing her mask. Draco was leaving for good and she won't see him anymore. That's what this all means. Draco wanted to get away from her. He's moving away, with Astoria."This isn't over yet." Andrew rand his hand through her hair.Hermione shook her head. "It's over." She pulled away from him. "What's the sense of talking to him now? He has decided."Andrew tried to wipe her tears away but Hermione did it by herself. Andrew didn't take his eyes off either. The only light that they have is from the moon and the stars. They were near the edge of a cliff and they could hear the waves of the sea. The wind was blowing her hair and her dress slowly. "I lost him."Andrew looked down on his shoes then back up at her again. "You are a fighter, Hermione. Fight as long as you can. I know you could do it. Fight for your love."Hermione placed her arm around herself and looked away. "Fight for my love? How can I fight for something when I know I already lost?"Andrew smiled sadly at her. He knew what she felt because that is what he was feeling right now. But he doesn't want to tell her that. He wants her to be happy, even if it's not with him. "I have to get something. Just wait here." He handed her her clutch and left.Andrew walked back to the patio. He brushed of his sleeves and entered the ballroom. He craned his neck around the ballroom but he couldn't see Draco around. He spotted Astoria who was talking to Pansy and Lavander. He also saw Blaise and Theo. "Where's Draco?"Blaise shrugged. "I don't know. Where's Hermione?""I'll go back to her now."oOoOoOoHermione heard footsteps. "I want to go home now Andrew." She turned around and her eyes grew wide. It wasn't Andrew. She didn't expect to see him right now. "Draco." She whispered.Draco went to this place because when he was little, this was where he could think. He loves the silence and the only sound you would hear is the sea. He wanted to clear his mind with all that happened. He especially wanted to clear his mind with the memory of Andrew and Hermione. He thought he would be alone in this place but he was wrong.Andrew was just a couple of steps away from them. When he saw that Draco was there with Hermione, he walked away, smiling sadly. He knew that everything would be better for Hermione from now on.Draco got caught up on his step that he almost lost his balance. He turned around and started to walk away when he heard Hermione speak. "Draco!"He turned to face her. "What?"Hermione opened her clutch and took out the necklace. "Do you remember this?"Draco leaned closer. "You said that's our engagement thing.""I'll give it back. It's yours.""I told you I gave it to you. You could do whatever you want with it."Hermione's lips formed in a straight line. "Fine." She threw the necklace away to the sea.Draco was shocked that she would throw their engagement necklace but he knew that she's finally moved on. He took a step back when he heard her call him again."I know you, Draco, more than you know yourself…more than Astoria."Draco raised his brow. "Really? Okay, let's see how well you know me."Hermione took a small step forward. "Do you like romance novels?" Hermione asked, she was breathing hard.Draco wrinkled his nose. "I hate romance novels…I prefer…""Tragedy, I know." Hermione interjected. "But you do read romance novels now."Draco snorted. "That's impossible.""It was impossible until you finally gave my favorite book a chance. You read it over and over again. You read my letter before and after you finish the book. You know what else I know about you?"Draco was silent but only because he saw something on his mind. His silence urged her to continue. "You would rather carry your girlfriend and ruin your good shoes when it rains than get her feet dirty."Draco folded his arms but there were images flashing back on his mind. "Anyone could do that."Hermione smiled. "Yeah. Anyone can. Especially you, who claims not to be a romantic person." She looked up in the night sky then back at him. "You do the sweetest thing that no other guy could do. You filled my house with post its with handwritten reasons why you love me, you send me flowers of different colors, you celebrated my whole twenty-three birthday and Christmas, you spend your time with me like nothing else matters but the two of us."Draco looked away as some images began to pop one by one in his mind.Hermione continued. "You have the lamest cheesy pick up lines. You do. The first thing you asked me is if I believe in love at first sight. You popped behind me and asked if I believe in second sight." She looked wrapped her arms around her waist. "And you know what? I believe in first, second, third and so on. Because I love you every time I see you." Her eyes began to fill with tears. She thanked her mask and the moonlight for hiding it to Draco."You pretend to be a ladies' man, but when you found the one for you, you get jealous easily. You would even hire a private investigator to check the background of every guy I've ever met." She gave a short laugh through sobs."You are the worst cook. The lasagna you cooked for me?" She wrinkled her nose. "Even you couldn't finish it. You also make sure I was okay before you start playing a quidditch game.""Why are you saying this?" Draco muttered. He felt his heart start to beat fast. His head started to ache. All the visions on his mind pop up from one to another. It's like the blurry image is starting to become clear.Hermione ignored him. "You're willing to bid millions of galleons for my picture but I told you, you have me."Draco wanted to get away but he can't move."You even called me as your amnesia girl.""My amnesia girl?" He repeated in a soft voice almost a whisper."Yes. It was another chance for us. That was the reason why we love each other more. But if I were given a chance, I would love to be your amnesia girl again because you showed me how much you love me every single day. I fall in love with you every single day."Draco shook his head, he feared of what else she might say. "Enough of this. I'm leaving.""You're a coward." She stated.Draco jerked his head to face her. "What did you say?""You're scared because what I'm saying is true. You won't accept that you are a different person. You won't accept the love I'm giving you. You left me before in the aisle because you were scared and my mistake was letting you run away. You always run away and I always let you. This time, I won't. I won't accept your excuses and let you take years before you realize that you feel the same way as I do.""I'm not running away." Draco said defensively."That's bullshit." Hermione growled.Draco saw another image in his mind."I know you're running away. It's better to run away right? You always do that, and I always let you. This time it's not going to happen.""Stop it." Draco said, running his hand absently through his hair."You stop it. Stop fighting it. You are running away with Astoria. Do you love her? Does she love you?""She loves me.""She does? Why does she love you?" Hermione said, taking a step forward.Draco took two steps forward, shoving his hands on his pocket. They were an arm length away. "What are you trying to prove?""Why can't you tell me why she loves you?"Draco doesn't really remember the reasons why Astoria loves him. He wasn't really listening. He heard a dozens of women telling him why they love him and it's mostly about his looks and his money. He licked his lips and looked at Hermione. "Tell me, why do you love me?" He muttered, his voice soft.Hermione swallowed. "I don't know why I love you."Draco smirked and looked down briefly. "Wow. That's nice."Hermione tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Do I really need a reason to love you? What if I tell you I love you because of your looks? Years later, when we grow old, your looks will fade. Does it mean my love for you will fade as well?" She swallowed, fighting back the tears away. "After leaving me in the aisle, after forgetting about me, after breaking off with me, I still fucking love you. I don't know why I do but it's just here." She pointed at her chest.Draco kept his gaze at her. His heart was beating fast and there were images after images flashing through his mind again. This was the first time he heard someone say this to him. This was the first time someone loved him for who he truly is."You asked me not to fall in love with someone else. You didn't need to ask, because I would never love anyone other than you." Hermione choked through sobs.Draco shook his head. "Andrew?" He took a step back. He remembered the kiss this afternoon. He remembered the double date. He remembered the way Hermione smiled at Andrew and how happy they were dancing at the ballroom. "I'm sorry, but I have to go."Hermione let out tears in her eyes while she took his arm. "Draco. Close your eyes."Draco doesn't know why but he did. If this was Hermione's last request, then he would do it. He would be leaving tomorrow morning and he doesn't know if he would ever see her again.Hermione took his hands. "You once told me that when you close your eyes, that's when you know what your heart truly feels." She tried to compose herself so she could say it what she wanted to say. "Thank you. You taught me so many things. You taught me how to forgive. You taught me how to fight for the one I love. You taught me that it is possible to make someone fall in love with you over and over again." Draco's eyes were still closed but she could see his lips trembling. She smiled sadly. "You made me realize so many things, Draco, and one of them is that my greatest fear isn't the fear of heights. My greatest fear is losing you and I guess I did.Before the accident, you told me to wait for you and to not go anywhere else. I did and I still am. I'm still here waiting for you." She wrapped her arms around him. "Good bye Draco. I hope that this time, all the anger in your heart would be gone. I hope that this time, it would be full of love and happiness." She repeated the same thing he told her before. "I love you Draco." She pulled away slowly and walked away. She finally said what she wanted to say. She took a few steps away and a few more minutes, she found herself walking faster.Hermione's voice echoed his mind. It was a familiar sound to him. He saw an image in his mind that he was surrounded with shattered glass; his shirt was covered with blood. He heard Hermione's voice again. "I love you Draco." His eyes began to fill with tears. He opened his eyes and he saw Hermione walking away. He took a step forward and tried to call her when another image of him trying to reach his cell phone appeared.His head began to throb. He knelt on his knees and looked up again at the fleeting back of Hermione. He placed his hands on his head because it really did fucking hurt. He saw image after image…only this time, it was clear. He closed his eyes shut. A memory came out and it was Hermione blowing out twenty three candles. There was another image of Hermione taking pictures of him. Another memory of him and Hermione up in the sky watching the London Eye appeared."Hermione." He whispered. He remembers now. When he had an accident, he was reaching for his phone. He was trying to call for Hermione. He even tried to call out her name but found it difficult because of the blood on his throat. He remembers Ben taking his phone."Hermione." He whispered some more. "Hermione." His voice was louder. He looked up but Hermione was nowhere to be found.All his memories were back. He stood up, going to the edge of the cliff and pointed his wand down to the sea. Hermione's necklace flew up and landed on his palm. He placed the necklace on his pocket and ran as fast as he could back to the mansion. He has to get Hermione. He loves her. He loves her and only her. He opened the doors of the patio and went inside the grand ballroom. Some of the guests were looking at him. He pushed the people who were blocking his way. "Hermione." He muttered. He looked around. He can't lose her. He looked around once more and saw her."HERMIONE!" He yelled.All eyes were on him now. Hermione turned around. The guests who were blocking the two of them stepped away. Hermione and Draco's friends were watching them also. The ballroom turned silent."Draco? What is the meaning of this?" Astoria strutted her way to Draco's side.Draco looked down at her and glowered. "Get the fuck out of here."Astoria looked appalled. "What did you say?" She looked nervously around. "Draco, dear, could we talk about this later?" She placed her hand on his arm. Draco looked at her hand and pulled his hand away."Draco?" Astoria choked. Theo and Marcus pulled her away out of the ballroom. Astoria continued to scream out Draco's name. The guests looked at her disapprovingly. Theo and Marcus came back and shut the doors of the ballroom with their wands. When that was over, all eyes went back to Draco and Hermione. They stood a few steps away from each other.Hermione looked at him expectantly, waiting for Draco to say something. Draco gazed at her. "Hermione." He muttered. He took a step forward. "You are the only girl who won't accept my gifts. I hate it when you don't like the gifts I give you. But, one day, you accepted the green ballet flats. Green really suits you."He heard Ron snort and Ginny stepped on Ron's foot making another sound.Draco took a step forward. "You are the only girl who would treasure those flats and when it started to rain, you covered it under your shirt. You would rather get your feet dirty than ruin those shoes I gave you." He looked down a moment and then back at Hermione who has tears pooling her eyes. She was still wearing her mask.Draco took off his mask and accioed a single rose from the vase. He looked down on it and transformed it into a tulip. "You are the only girl I know who has an odd taste in color… white. You hate roses too but love tulips." He smirked and muttered something, making the tulip float in the air and fly in front of Hermione. Hermione took it and glanced back up at Draco. He continued. "You are the only girl who compared me to shit. I would never forget that line you told me." He smirked holding his one finger up. "You are the only girl I know who says funny words like kidnapping and phrases like many fishes and lakes."Harry sniggered while Ron and Ginny gave him an odd look. Theo asked Blaise what Draco was talking about and Pansy shushed them both.Hermione bit her lip trying to hold back a sob. Is she dreaming right now? Does Draco have his memories back? Draco took another step. "You are the only girl I know who taught me about this mother's cure. You know – the one that could stop someone from laughing?" Draco pinched his nose for a second. Hermione gave a short laugh, tears streaming down her face. Draco pinched her nose with his other hand for a second and then placed his hand back down. "It still works."Hermione smiled. Draco waved his hand. "Forget my lasagna. You are the only girl who cooks mouthwatering dishes and makes those little Draco designs in cupcakes."Draco took another step closer. He was three steps away from Hermione. "You're the only girl who I know that can't bloody see how beautiful you are. Every time I see you, Hermione, I had to catch my breath…amnesia or not." He took another step. "You are the only girl who loves me for who I am and the only girl who doesn't realize that the only girl in my heart is you."He took another step closer. "I remember when you asked me who this special girl was. What was she like and all I had to do was look at you because you are my special girl…my amnesia girl." He placed his fingertips at the corner of her mask and removed it. "I remember saying that you are an angel in disguise. And when I see you, I would like to stop time just to look at you for the rest of my life. You are the light in my dark life. You gave warmth to my cold stone heart. You are the reason why I wake up each day and the reason why I have good dreams at night. I can't imagine my life without you." He took steps closer, taking the space between them.Draco brushed his thumbs on her cheeks. "I told you before that I am helping you find your way back to me but you were the one who helped me find my way back to you. I may have run away for so many times. I may have forgotten but my soul found yours." He rested his head on top of hers. "I highlighted the phrase "My soul will find yours."  in your favorite book the day I started reading it because I know someday, I will find you." He smiled. "You're right. I love romantic novels."Hermione sighed and placed her hands on his wrists. "I know you do."Hermione glanced up at Draco. Draco gazed at her eyes, his hand falling down her neck. "I'm sorry, Hermione. I was a coward. I keep forcing myself to deny the truth even though deep in my heart I know that you are all I want…all I need. Though my mind has forgotten, my heart never did. You already have my heart Hermione. You always have my heart. I love you so much."Draco leaned in closer and kissed Hermione deeply and passionately. He snaked his arms around her waist. She wrapped her arms around him, her other hand running up his hair.There was applause around the ballroom. There were also whistles and cheers. Sara wiped the tears in her eyes. There were also other women crying tears of joy, Ginny and Pansy were one of them. At the end of the room, Andrew smiled, clapping his hands as well. Way to go Hermione.Hermione pulled away when they were both out of breath. Draco took out the necklace out of his pocket. He pointed to the diamond. "This is you." Then he pointed to the circular pendant surrounding it. "This is me. You see? I'm here to love you and protect you always." He repeated the words he told her before when he gave her the necklace. Draco placed the necklace at Hermione's neck. He traced it with his fingers. He smiled down at Hermione."I love you Draco Malfoy." Hermione said in a soft voice.Draco smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "I love you Hermione Granger." He pulled her once again for another kiss but before he did he whispered. "Forevermore."oOoOoOoA/N: EPILOGUE NEXT. Thank you so much to all the readers and for those who left their reviews.

A/N: To percy'shellokity 32, I posted an epilogue but I deleted it after a few hours then posted a note. To the rest of you who read my first post of epilogue here is the new one. I did much better effort for this epilogue. While I was writing the second fic, I realized that I should finish My Amnesia Girl properly. Thank you dear anonymous guest commenter and you inspired me to work harder for the epilogue. Yipee! Inspiration is back… I think. I would somehow place here the missing parts of the original epilogue. Hopefully I would remember every detail of it. This is the same concept as the epilogue I posted... only better (in my opinion). Finally and hopefully, this would leave you all smiling."Stop!" Astoria yelled, slamming the door open of the grand ballroom. All eyes turned to her. She strutted to where Hermione and Draco were. She pointed a finger at Hermione. "You filthy stupid mudblood." She growled. She took another step closer while Draco pushed Hermione behind him."Shut up Astoria." Draco glared at Astoria. "Damn you. You used my amnesia to lie to me. You fucking hurt Hermione and manipulated me to make the most stupid decision of my life which almost cost me to lose Hermione completely.""Draco- I" Astoria stammered. "I did it because I love you."Draco looked at her in disgust. "Who are you to say that? You don't love me. You love my money."Astoria scoffed and cocked her head to the side. "The only one who is after your money is that mudbl-"SLAPHermione gasped while Draco still looked at Astoria like she was a little dirt on his mansion. Ginny slapped Astoria so hard that Astoria fell on the floor. "Don't you ever talk to Hermione that way. The only disgusting creature here is you."Draco narrowed his eyes. "Don't you ever go near me or Hermione. I would have Heindrichs cancel all contracts in New York." Draco took Hermione by the waist pulling her closer to him. He paused and narrowed his eyes. "And for the record, I would never love a maggot like you.""Draco!" Astoria stood up and tried to run towards him. Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Marcus blocked her way."Step aside." Astoria tried to shove past them."That would be pointless, Astoria." Andrew said.Astoria turned to face him. "You. Why would you let Draco have her?"Andrew smirked. "Draco have her already. It's just you who's too blinded by money to see it."Astoria clenched her jaw and looked around. Realization hit her that there were still other guests surrounding them. She swallowed and saw the disapproving looks of the guests. Violet turned her back as if she doesn't know Astoria.Andrew took out an envelope inside his coat. "I told you if you hurt Hermione, I would liquidate all my shares in your company making you completely broke." Andrew handed her the envelope. "It has my signature in it." He turned his heel. "Good luck finding thousands of investors to make up for that loss." He walked out of the ballroom to the patio.Astoria looked around. Other investors and designers looked at her in disgust. She could hear whispers and soft mumbles from the people. Astoria tore the document and was planning to take her wand to attack Draco and Hermione when Harry and Ron stood beside her, taking both her arms."I would think twice before doing that." Harry said. He and Ron lead Astoria out of the ballroom. Outside the Abraxas Mansion were Aurors. They would make sure to keep an eye at Astoria and send her to her parents in Scotland. Her parents and sister have already been informed with their company being broke and they were planning to send Astoria to her Aunt Antoinette in Prague to work in a restaurant as a cleaner.oOoOoOoDraco looked at Hermione, his hands on her arms. "Hermione." He said once more. Hermione gave him a small smile, trying so hard to stop tears forming her eyes. She failed miserably though. Draco pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her. Pansy and the rest told the guests to continue on with the party. Draco led Hermione to another room, far away from their friends and the rest of the guests.They were in the library and he opened the door leading to another terrace. The moon shine bright lighting the beautiful view of the sea. Draco took both her hands and brought it up his lips, kissing it gently. He placed both her hands down but didn't let go. "I'm sorry." His voice starting to break. "I'm really sorry." Tears began forming his eyes.Hermione brushed his tears away. "It's not your fault."Draco shook his head. "It is. I've hurt you so much. I pushed you away."Hermione brought up her finger up to his lips. "Let's forget about it."Draco pulled her once again in his arms, letting the tears flow freely. "I won't forgive myself if I lose you." Hermione wrapped her arms around him soothing his back. She was crying. She and Draco has been through a lot and he broke her heart many times but she still loves him."I love you Draco." She whispered through sobs.Draco tightened his arms on her waist. He remembered everything and he hates himself for hurting Hermione. He hates himself so much for trying to push her away. He hates himself for almost giving her to Andrew. He remembered the kiss Hermione and Andrew had this afternoon.He pushed her away slightly. "I saw – I saw you with Andrew outside the restaurant."Hermione gasped and was about to say something but Draco was quick. "I understand. I do.""It was nothing.""I know. It's my fault.""Draco."He pulled her closer. "I'm the asshole. I'm the one to take the blame." He remembered the night Hermione saw him kissing Astoria. He screwed up big time this time. How could he do this to her? How could she still forgive him after everything he's done to her?He gave out a loud frustrated sigh. He pulled away and ran his hands up to his hair. "I don't want to hurt you anymore."Hermione placed her hand on his shoulder. "You won't hurt me anymore." She reassured him."You deserve someone better."Hermione wiped the tears in her eyes. She could see how beaten he was with all the things he did to her. It hurts her to see him that way. He looked like he was under a crucio spell.She took both his cheeks and forced him to look at her. "Draco. It's always been you and me. Nothing and no one could ever change that." Draco tried to look away but she stopped him. "I love you… I'm in love with you always had, always will."Draco took her wrists and pulled her in his arms once again. "I would do everything I could to deserve your love." He was shaking. "I have to do this. I have to earn your love."Hermione could only nod. Draco doesn't have to prove anything. He doesn't need to show her anything. She loves him. Nothing has changed. She's happy that he remembers everything now. She's happy that he's here with her right now.If this is what Draco needs to do, then she would let him.Draco planted a kiss on her lips. "I have to talk to someone first."Hermione nodded again. She composed herself and they both went back to the ballroom.oOoOoOo"Andrew." Draco muttered.Andrew turned around. He wasn't wearing his mask anymore. They were in the garden. "Draco."Draco looked down on the grass then back at him. "I love Hermione.""I know you do." Andrew said."And you love her too.""I do." Andrew smirked."Why?""Why do I love her?" Andrew looked surprised.Draco shook his head. "I know we would go on and on why you love her but I want to know…Why did you let her go?""I told Astoria already." Andrew sighed. "She's always been yours.""She deserves you more." Draco said in a soft voice, barely audible, but Andrew heard it clear."I know I do, but she loves you more."Draco glanced up at Andrew. "I'll make it up to her, even if it takes me a lifetime."Andrew smirked. "You have to. But you know what? Just do it. Prove it."Draco nodded. "I will."Andrew was about to walk right past him when he heard him Draco call his name."Thank you, you know, for being there for Hermione."Andrew nodded. "There's nothing I wouldn't do for Hermione." He took a step forward. "One more screw up and I wouldn't let you have her." He glanced at Draco. "I mean it."Draco smirked. Andrew walked back inside the ballroom, Draco followed.oOoOoOo"Draco." Ginny called him.Draco turned his head and saw Ginny and Harry walking towards him. Draco was about to go where Hermione is, who apparently was talking to Pansy and Blaise."Ginny. Harry." Draco gave a short nod.Ginny smiled at him but Harry was still frowning."I'm happy you remember everything." Ginny said. "Make it right this time. She's been through a lot."Harry narrowed his eyes. "I'll be watching you."Ginny nudged Harry's arm. Harry looked at Ginny. "What? If he hurts Hermione again, I am entitled to give him the Unforgivable."Ginny rolled her eyes and looked back at Draco. "Well, I'm happy for the both of you. But yeah, we'll be watching you. You don't want a slap like I did to Astoria, right?"Draco smirked. "I'll keep that in mind.""Maybe we should write a contract about it. You know, just in case you have amnesia again." Harry shrugged."Harry." Ginny warned."I'll let my assistant prepare the contract first thing tomorrow morning." Draco looked amused.Harry looked at Ginny and then at Draco. "Good.""Draco!" Theo called him."Excuse me." Draco said and took long strides to where Theo was."Hey, I missed you man." Theo placed his arm on Draco's shoulder.Draco took Theo's hand away. "I remember everything, Theo. I did recall you calling my fiancé hot and I think you admitted fantasizing about her body."Theo swallowed nervously and placed both his arms up. "She's really hot, Drake. You should be proud of her because every single dude in this room wants her and you have her."Draco narrowed his eyes. "Don't you ever talk about my fiancé that way.""Okay. Okay. Fine." Theo laughed. "I guess next time I would see your room in such a messy state, my theory would be correct, no?"Draco was about to get his wand but Theo fleeted away."What was that all about?" Blaise asked, Pansy was beside him."It was nothing." Draco chuckled and gave Pansy a hug, Blaise a brotherly hug."Finally, you're no longer the stubborn bastard with a fucked up mind." Blaise sighed happily.Draco grinned. "I finally understand what you meant."Pansy placed her hand on Draco's arm. "It's great to have you back." She turned her head. "Look how happy Hermione is."Draco turned his head and saw Hermione laughing with her Gryffindor friends. It's been a long time since he's seen her that happy.He saw Andrew walking towards Hermione. Andrew whispered something and Hermione looked around for Draco. She spotted him and Draco nodded, making her sure he was okay with her talking to Andrew.oOoOoOoHermione and Andrew were in a hallway outside the ballroom. "I'm happy for you." He said. "For the both of you." He added.Hermione smiled. "Thank you. And I'm not preferring to your statement right now. I'm thanking you for everything you've done for me.""You've said that already but you don't need to thank me." Andrew bit his lip. "Here."He handed a small envelope to her. Hermione was about to open it when Andrew stopped her. "Read it tomorrow morning."Hermione nodded. "Andrew-"Before Hermione could say more, Andrew pulled her into his arms. Hermione wrapped her arms around him. She doesn't know why she felt new set of tears forming but she knows what this hug meant. Andrew was saying goodbye.Andrew pulled away and walked towards the end of the hallway and out of the mansion not even looking back at her."Goodbye Andrew." Hermione whispered.oOoOoOoHermione felt like she was dreaming. She opened her eyes and looked around. She wasn't in her room. She sat up and realized it was Draco's room in the Abraxas mansion. She tried to recall what happened last night and recalled that Draco remembered her. She looked beside her and the other side of the bed was empty. She stood up, she was wearing her night gown and she looked for her robe. It was hanging in the chair. She wore her robe and went out the terrace. It was a beautiful day. She could see the sea from her view and wind was blowing her face. She heard the door to the room open and she turned around. Draco was carrying a silver tray with some pancakes and coffee.Draco grinned at her and placed the tray down an iron table in the terrace.Draco wrapped his arms around her waist. "Good morning, love.""Good morning." Hermione muttered. She planted a soft kiss on his lips."I made breakfast for you.""You made this?" Hermione raised her brow."Sara did." Draco smiled his boyish smile. "Now eat."If this is a dream, Hermione doesn't want to wake up anymore. Draco joined her as they ate in the terrace. She watched him do this habit he does when eating his pancake. She could watch him forever.Draco looked up at her. "You're getting more beautiful every time I see you.""That's too cheesy." Hermione giggled.Draco smirked. "I know. He took a bite of his pancake. "But it's the truth."Hermione playfully rolled her eyes then her face turned serious. "Where were you last night?"Draco frowned. "I was sleeping beside you."Hermione nodded pretending to think when a slow smile formed her lips. "That's why you weren't in my dreams last night."Draco chuckled. "I missed this." He placed his hand on top of hers. "I missed you." He brought her hands up to his lips and kissed it. "I love you.""I hope you're like a broken record so you could say it over and over again."Draco leaned closer to her. "I love you. I love you. I love you."Hermione giggled. "Now let's finish this meal. Sara hates wasted food."oOoOoOoHermione remembered the envelope Andrew gave her. She took it out from her purse and settled herself in the bed. She opened it and read his letter.Hermione,By the time you read this, I'm already on my way back to New York. I'm really happy for you. I know you are happy because Draco is the only one who could bring a smile to your face. I've seen it a thousand times. Always smile, Hermione. You brighten everyone up with that smile of yours. It really does because that's what happens to me when I see you.Let me tell you this, I know why you kissed me yesterday. Don't feel bad about it. I understand that I could never replace Draco in your heart, but I don't care. I still love you and I will always keep my promise that I would always be here for you. This time, I know that everything would be okay. I cannot tell when we will see each other again but just to let you know, you'll always have a special place in my heart. You've thanked me so many times but it's me who should thank you. Thank you, Hermione, for letting me love you. Thank you for letting me wipe your tears away. Thank you for letting me be your shoulder to lean on. Always keep this in mind, I'd do it over and over again in a heartbeat. This isn't a goodbye. This is a new beginning.Till we meet again.Much love,AndrewTears started to fill in Hermione's eyes. Andrew has always been there for her and picked her up through her darkest hour. Though she never returned his feelings for her, he would always have a special place in her heart. She placed the letter in her chest and sighed."What's wrong love?" Draco asked, sitting beside her."Andrew's letter." She handed it to him.Draco pushed it away. "I don't need to read it."Hermione nodded and placed the letter on top of the bedside table. She rested her head on his shoulder."Andrew is a great guy.""He is.""You love him." Draco looked down at his hands.Hermione sat up straight and faced him. "I do. But I'm in love with you."He smiled and pulled her closer to him. "I'm in love with you too. I never get tired of telling you, showing you how much I love you."oOoOoOoHermione sighed at the beautiful view before her. The sun's rays made the sea sparkling like little diamonds. The sky was blue with a few clouds covering it. She could hear waves hitting the edge of the cliff. The wind blowing off her face. Everything so peaceful, so calm. She smiled quietly at the place where she stood. This was the same place where Draco remembered her. Yes, they were in the Abraxas Mansion.A year has gone by since Draco had his memory back. A year full of Draco days for Hermione and every single day gets better than the other. She couldn't ask for more. He did make it up to her. They travelled together. He surprised her many times and they moved in together in a lofty flat in Muggle London.Hermione turned her head and saw the mansion behind her. It looks like those mansions featured in a magazine or the one in the movies. She sighed contentedly and looked back at the sea.It seems just like yesterday when she was in the exact same place wearing another kind of white gown, only it was for a party and she was wearing a mask that time.Hermione tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. The wind is blowing hard and luckily, she placed magic on both her hair and makeup so it won't get messy before the big event. She doesn't want to remember Astoria. She doesn't want to remember all the pain and heartaches. What matters is that Draco is with her right now. She turned her head slightly looking at the other end of the sea.She and Draco has been through a lot and even if thousands of problems came towards them, they still have each other and they love each other more. She could never love anyone the same way as Draco.Andrew.She did send him an invitation but she doesn't know if he ever received it or if he would come to her big day. All she ever heard was his company was going well and rumors said that he was spotted with another woman. They said that her name is Margaux Dubois, his childhood sweetheart from France. Hermione remembered seeing the photo of Margaux and Andrew in a magazine and they look perfect together. Margaux has long strawberry blonde hair and gray eyes. She is very beautiful and her body is petite. Andrew and Margaux looked happy together in their pictures. Andrew said in that article that he never know where he and Margaux would lead to but for now they are just enjoying each other's company.She was happy for the both of them, especially for Andrew. He was a really great friend and she wishes him all the best in life. She promised herself to always be there for him as well.oOoOoOo"Hermione." Ginny called out to her.Hermione turned around and faced her friend. "Hey Gin.""Draco said you were here so I had to check on you. Are you okay?" Gin placed her hand on Hermione's shoulder.Hermione nodded. "I just love this place." She sighed again. "I still feel like this is the dream. A kind of dream where I don't want to wake up anymore." She paused. "I fear that I might lose Draco again.""I think it's the other way around, love." Draco said from the distance. Hermione turned her head and felt butterflies fluttering in her stomach. Draco is really handsome. He was wearing black tux and slacks. He has a black bow tie on his neck. His hair was in the same style, messy but neat. I am the luckiest girl in the world. Hermione thought.Ginny gave one last look at Hermione and gave a small smile. "I'll leave you two alone. You look so beautiful, Hermione." She gave one last squeeze at Hermione's hand and left."What you're doing right now is bad luck." Hermione said pointedly. "And what do you mean that it's the other way around?"Draco took slow steps towards her, looking at her from head to toe. He had to catch his breath at the beautiful woman in front of him. She looks like an angel sent from above. I am the luckiest man in the world. He thought. "First off, I don't care if it's bad luck or not. I know what I want and I'll do whatever it takes to have it." He snaked his arms around her waist, giving her a sweet longing kiss on the lips. Hermione pulled away slightly resting her hands on his chest. "Second, I am the one who is scared to death to lose you. I've lost you so many times that I thought that you fell for someone else already.""Still jealous of Andrew?" She teased.Draco scoffed. "No. I'm just selfish. I hate talking about old flames." He looked at her. "And let's not talk about her."Hermione smiled. "I'm not saying anything. Anyway, you have me." Hermione whispered. "You always have."Draco smirked. "I know…And you always have me." His smirk grew into a genuine smile. "And in just a few minutes you'll officially be my wife."Hermione cupped both of her hands on his face. "I can't wait." She pulled him and gave him another kiss."Now that you have kissed the bride. Can you marry the bride now?" They heard Harry, who was standing a few steps away from them.Both Draco and Hermione turned their heads to face him. Draco smirked. "Hey Potter, it's the bride who kissed me. So yeah, she could marry me now."Hermione playfully hit his arm. Draco laughed and kissed her once again. He pulled away and walked back to the garden. "I'll see you in a while, love."Harry shook his head slightly but waltzed to where Hermione stood."Having second thoughts? Cause I could help you bail on this wedding if you want." Harry said."Harry." Hermione warned.Harry smiled. He was just a step away. "You know I'm just kidding." He laughed for a while then his face turned serious. "But if you really want to ditch the wedding –""Harry." Hermione glared at him."I'm just kidding. Hey." He took out a small box on his pocket. "I know you wish your parents were here with you right now at this special moment. I wish they were here too, but, I know they are watching over you. As your best friend, I want to give you this for your special day." He opened the box. "Something blue."Hermione gasped as her tears began to fill with tears. "Harry – it's beautiful."It was a small brooch studded with diamonds and sapphires. It has a flower-like design. Hermione took the brooch and placed it in the middle of her neckline. "Thank you, Harry. But this is too much."Harry smiled. "This is your big day. You deserve this much." He offered his arm. "Let's get this over with, shall we?"Hermione smiled and placed her hand on his arm.oOoOoOoThe garden of Abraxas Mansion was huge. There were seats on both sides and a white long carpet in the middle. They were surrounded with white and pink tulips. At the altar was a small white stage surrounded with more white and pink tulips and a floating white satin cloth studded with diamonds and pearls. There was a soft melodic tune playing as Hermione stood at the aisle. Harry gave Hermione a kiss on the cheek and went to the front row.Everyone was standing and watching her walk down the aisle. She peeked to her left and saw Andrew. He smiled and winked at her and Hermione fought back the tears and smiled back. She looked at the right and saw Draco's friends. She also saw her friends on the opposite side. Molly and Ginny were wiping their tears. Lucius and Narcissa were there too. She was halfway in the aisle when she looked at the altar. There is Draco, the man she loves. She felt more butterflies flutter in her stomach. Draco gave her a warm smile and took a step forward.Hermione paused, remembering their failed wedding ceremony a few years ago. Her breath caught up and she stopped walking. Draco took another step forward and another. He stopped in front of her and kissed her again. He pulled away, both his hand on her arms. "I just can't help it." He smirked.Hermione felt tears prickling her eyes. "I thought-""Shh" Draco whispered. He knows what she's thinking. "I love you. I want to marry you right here, right now." He smirked. "Can you walk a little faster so you could be my wife already?"Hermione gave a short laugh. "Get your ass back up there and I'll be there soon."Draco smiled and gave her one last kiss. There were soft laughs and sobs from the people around them.oOoOoOoExchanging of vows."Hermione Jean Granger, I love you. I've told you this a million times but it doesn't seem to be enough. We have gone through a lot and it came to the point where I almost lost you completely." He paused and tried to stop the tears in his eyes. He really hated that memory of the past. "But, no matter how such a coward, a fool, a stubborn bastard with a fucked up mind I am, you stayed. You still held on." He tightened his grip on her hand. "I am the luckiest man on earth because no one would've even loved me this much after everything we've been through." His eyes began to fill with tears. "Even if it takes a lifetime for me to make up for all the wrong things I've done, I would do it. I would love you even until after life. Before, I was afraid that I might lose myself when we are together. I thought that I couldn't stand up for us but I was wrong. I couldn't go on through life without you. You are the light in my dark soul, and it doesn't matter what happens in this life as long as you're with me. Because of you, Hermione, I laugh, I smile, and I dare to dream again. I look forward with great joy to spending the rest of my life with you, caring for you, nurturing you, being there for you in all life has for us." He paused. "And I vow to be true and faithful for the rest of my life. I love you."Hermione smiled through tears. "Draco Lucius Malfoy. I may not know why I love you but I do know how to love you. Loving you is easy. You think you are not capable of love, but you are the only person I know who could make someone fall in love with you every single day. Yes, we've been through a lot. I have seen the best of you and the worst of you, and I choose both. I choose you for life. You are everything I need at this moment. And now I know that all of my prayers have been answered and all my dreams have come true. Your mind stirs my soul to new heights. Your faith in me gives me strength. Your touch delights me." She took a deep breath. "And without your love, I am incomplete." She let tears fall down. "You are my laugh, my smile and my dreams. You are more of an amazement to me, each day I rediscover you." She bit her lip trying to compose herself. "You always have my heart. For I am yours, and you are mine. I promise to be here for you always. I promise that I will walk with you hand in hand wherever journey leads us…living, learning, loving…together…forever. My heart will be your shelter and my arms will be your home as I have given you my hand to hold. I give you my life to keep. I love you."Draco wiped the tears in her eyes. He couldn't ask for anything else anymore. He would love her today, tomorrow and forever.oOoOoOoForevermore – Side A"May I have a dance with my wife?" Draco bowed slightly and offered his hand. Hermione placed her hand gently on his and he led the way to the middle of the dance floor. "I don't know if you remember. But I was hoping that this would be our song."The music started and then she remembered it was the song they danced to in a small restaurant. The first time they danced again after the failed wedding. The dance where she ran away from him.The song is entitled Forevermore."We never get to finish the dance." Draco whispered and as if on cue with the song he said. "I love you." He placed his left hand on the small of her back and his right on her hand. They swayed and he turned her and pulled her closer. "You're all I need to be here with forevermore."Draco pulled her closer again. "Is my wife happy?"Hermione looked up at him. "Very. You?"Draco grinned. "I'm very happy."Hermione smiled and rested her head on his chest hearing her husband's heartbeat. It just feels like yesterday when they were in that restaurant hearing the same heartbeat of the man she loves. This was the heart she changed. The heart that realized that it was capable of loving someone else. This was the same heart that she would cherish forever for the rest of her life. She closed her eyes and sighed in contentment. She began to hear the clinging of glasses. She opened her eyes and looked up at Draco who was smiling at her. He leaned closer, wrapping his arms around her and planted a sweet longing kiss on her lips.oOoOoOoDraco's voice overAccording to the census, there are 9 million people in London. How will you know if you've found the one for you? Maybe you've seen her already, but you bent down to tie your shoelace. Maybe she was already beside you but you looked to another direction to see the traffic lights. Maybe you've already crossed each other's paths but the cab blocked your way. There are some people who were lucky to find the one for them. There are some, who's still searching and some have given up. But the worst part is, it's yours already but you let it slip away… I almost did let my true love slip away but fate or whatever you call it gave us a second and third chance… and I loved her even more. She loved me even more. How about you? Will you let your true love slip away? Or would you accept another chance fate gives you?oOoOoOoA/N: I hope this is better. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for the wonderful reviews. I was smiling while reading all your comments especially saying that my fic should be in the movies. I did picture Tom Sturridge as Andrew but he was not "bulky" enough like I had Andrew in mind. I also did consider Matt Long but I ended up thinking of Ian Somerhalder. I also used Andrew Garfield's name! Haha. However I picture Garfield as Theo. My Draco is Tom Felton/Ryan Gosling.
