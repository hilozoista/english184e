Happy New Year! Harry Potter is my all time favourite book series, so here is my first fanfiction about it! Please note, the chapters in this are supposed to be short, so although the story takes long, it'll be easier for me to update more frequently. Thank you.Everything in life happens for a reason. Some things are good, some are bad. But everything has an effect. It is important to not underestimate any minute in your life; it happened for a reason and therefore it will have a consequence. However insignificant the moment may seem, it happened for a reason. Life is like throwing a pebble into a pond. Every point in your life has an effect, which will alter what you do in later life. The ripples represent this. What you do at that moment will change the rest of your life. From then on, there is little you can do to change it. How you cope with it, however, is how you get through it. There are hundreds of 'pebbles' that can, no, will affect your life. Illness, death, financial crisis, even natural disasters. All these cause inevitable 'ripples' decide who you are. If you are brave or a coward. If you will be rich or poor. Free or trapped. Good or bad.However, some of these events do happen by accident. Perhaps you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe, someone mistook you for someone else. But still, these events will decide who you will be. What your true nature is. Henry Stanley Haskins once said 'What lies behind us and what lies in front of us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.' This quote is held close to my heart. My Mum would tell me this when I was upset. Your character is far more important than your past and future. Because, without character, emotions and feelings, what are we? Empty shells. Although they may mould us into what we are, you can't dwell on past events, or dread the future. You have to embrace each day like it's your last.Please review.

Second Chapter, enjoy!1st September 1984Eleven year old, Annie Ainsworth stood in Kings Cross Station, bouncing up and down with excitement."Hurry up, Daddy! We'll miss the train!" She said to her father, William Ainsworth, who was trying to find a trolley to put his daughter's luggage on."Calm down Annie. The train doesn't leave until elven o'clock. We have plenty of time." He said, pushing a trolley over to his daughter. He then lifted Annie's trunk on to it, while Annie placed her owl's cage on top. The Tawny owl screeched."Don't worry, Barney. I'll let you out soon enough." Annie reassured. She then turned to her father. "Come on, Daddy! Let's go."Her father chuckled, amused at how much energy his daughter could have after she'd been up since five o'clock. They weaved through people rushing to get to their trains on time. Annie pushed the trolley, while her father half ran to keep up with her. When they reached the wall between the large plastic numbers nine and ten, they stopped."What platform does your ticket say, Annie?" William asked. Annie fished her ticket out of her jacket pocket and looked at it. She frowned."Daddy, I think they made a mistake on the ticket." "How so?" William asked. "Well, the ticket says Platform Nine and Three Quarters!" Annie exclaimed. Suddenly she felt sick. What if this was someone's twisted idea of a joke? What if everyone back at school knew about it, and would laugh at her when she went back? A school for magic, how could she have been so stupid?"That's no mistake." A small voice said. Annie and William looked round and saw a small red head boy with freckles, around four years old looking at them."Little boy, where are your parents?" William said, kneeling down to the boy's height. The boy looked over his shoulder to where a large family full of red heads stood."Mum and Dad are making sure Charlie has everything before we go through the barrier.""What barrier?" Annie asked curiously. The boy looked around cautiously."The barrier that keeps the muggles out.""Muggles?" William asked. The boy nodded."People who can do magic. But we're wizards. We can do magic. I get to go to Hogwarts when I'm older and learn how to do magic.""That's where I'm going." Annie exclaimed. The boy smiled."Do you want me to get my Dad? He can show you how to get to the platform.""Thank you" Annie smiled. The boy grinned and ran over to the tall man with red hair that was thinning. The little boy tugged on the man's robes and quickly explained what was going on. He then turned and pointed toward Annie and her father. Imminently, the man's face lit up and her hurried across to the Ainsworths."Hello!" The man exclaimed. "Arthur Weasley, pleased to meet you." He stuck his hand out and William shook it."William Ainsworth, and this is my daughter Annie.""Nice to meet you." Annie said shyly."Ron says that you don't know how to get on to the platform?" Mr Weasley said."Oh yes. The Professor who visited us forgot to mention it. I hope we're not being a bother.""Oh, no bother at all! Our second son, Charlie, is attending Hogwarts this year, as in our eldest, Bill. Are you going in to first year?" Arthur asked Annie. She nodded. "So, you're muggles?" Mr Weasley asked William."Yes, I suppose I am.""I love muggles. There so fascinating. I work in the Misuse of Muggle artefacts office in the Ministry of Magic. Where do you work?" William was about to reply when a red headed woman came bustling over, followed by four children."Arthur! Where did you go? We have to get- Oh! Hello there! And who might you be?" She asked."William Ainsworth. This is my daughter Annie. She's starting Hogwarts this year and we didn't know how to get on to the platform. Your son and husband were just telling us how to.""Well that's very nice of them." She replied. She then turned to Mr Weasley. "Dear, we have to hurry along. Ginny's getting restless and you have to be at work soon.""Alright dear. Well then, I suppose I'd best show you how to get onto the platform!" Mr Weasley said, turning back to the Ainsworths. "You walk straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten. Don't worry, it's magic so no one will hurt themselves." He added at their alarmed looks."Well, thank you very much. And to answer your question, I own my own restaurant up North." William said proudly. Annie smiled, her father had worked hard on opening and managing the restaurant and was very proud of it."No problem. I hope you have a good time at Hogwarts, Annie.""Thank you, Mr Weasley." Annie said. Mr Weasley smiled, said goodbye and followed his wife towards the wall. One minute they were there, the next, they were gone."Come on Annie. Let's go." William said. Annie looked at the wall. Her feet were uncontrollable she couldn't stop them. The wall was getting closer. And closer. Annie held her breath and closed her eyes, waiting for the impact of the wall. But it never came. She open her eyes and saw a scarlet steam train, with a sign that read 'Hogwarts Express'. Around her, was hundreds of other students with their families, milling around and saying goodbyes. William appeared next to her."Well, this is very overwhelming, isn't it? Come on, let's get you sorted." He led her through the crowds of people, towards the empty compartments near the end of the train."Well, is this alright for you?""Yes Daddy, its fine." William sighed."I'm going to miss you, sweetheart.""I'll miss you too, Daddy. I'll send you loads of letters, though!" William raised an eyebrow."One every day?""Well, maybe not every day but-" William laughed and so did Annie. It was hard raising his daughter after his wife died, but somehow he managed. Annie was exactly like her mother. Smiling, he hugged her."Make sure you don't burn down the restaurant, Daddy." Annie said."Now don't you worry about me. Enjoy yourself.""I will, Daddy." William helped Annie lift her trunk into an empty compartment and returned to the platform."Work hard." He said. "Make lots of friends. And enjoy yourself. Love you.""I love you too Daddy."Please review.

Hi again. Thank you to the people who have read and either followed or favourited this fanfiction. It's only been up for twelve hours and already it has 2 follows, 1 fav, and 34 reads. Please keep them coming and please review!All our dreams can come true- if we have the courage to pursue them -Walt Disney1st September 1984After she'd said goodbye, Annie returned to the compartment. As the conductor's whistle rang from somewhere on the station, and Annie started to wave furiously as the train slowly picked up speed. She waved until she could no longer see the outline of her father. Annie sighed, feeling slightly homesick. She opened her trunk and took out her copy of Alice in Wonderland. It had been her mother's and it was one of her most treasured possessions. Curling up on the seat next to the window, she began to read. It wasn't long, however, before the compartment door opened. A girl, clearly a first year like Annie stood in the doorway."Is it alright if I sit here?" She asked unsurely."Of course." Annie replied, smiling. Relief flooded on to the girl's face, and she dragged her trunk in, placing it on the baggage rail."My name's Nymphadora Tonks, but I prefer to be called Tonks. My mother's a bit of an idiot when I come to names.""I think it's pretty. I've never met anyone called Nymphadora. My name's Annie Ainsworth. Annie's a pretty common name." They both laughed."Yep, you're right. I've met someone called Annie before.""Well, you get the honour of being the first person I've met called Nymphadora.""What an honour!" The girl said, theatrically throwing her hands in the air. The two girls laughed again. "But seriously, call me Tonks.""Alright, Tonks.""Hey, you're catching on."Annie looked at the girl, Tonks. She had light brown hair, dark twinkling eyes and a pale heart shaped face. But, all of a sudden, her hair appeared to be turning pink."Ummâ€¦Your hair is going pink." Annie said slowly, so the girl wasn't spooked. However, her reaction was not how Annie thought it would be. Tonks just picked up a strand of the now all pink hair and looked at it."Oh well, so much for keeping it a secret.""Keeping what a secret?" Tonks just looked at Annie and smiled."I'm a Metamorphmagus." Tonks said proudly. "It means I can change my appearance at will." She explained in response to Annie's confused look."Wow! That's amazing!" Annie exclaimed."Yeah, it is." Tonks blushed. "Hey, watch this!"Annie watched as Tonks closed her eyes and screwed up her face, almost like she was deep in thought. Then, her features started to change. Tonks' pink hair slowly turn blonde and got curlier and her face structure changed. When Tonks opened her eyes, revealing chocolate brown eyes instead of the dark, twinkling eyes, it was like Annie was looking in a mirror."Y-You look just like me!""I know! Don't I look pretty?" Annie blushed and Tonks changed her face back."So then," Tonks said. "What house do you want to be sorted into?""I'm not sure. I've only read about them, but I don't really think I fit in to any. Where do you want to be sorted to?" Annie asked."Either Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. They sound like the best. My Dad was in Hufflepuff but my mum was in Slytherin. But don't worry, she's not an evil witch. She even got disowned because she married a muggle born.""Aww, that's quite romantic." Tonks made a face."It's not when they remind you every day. What houses were your parents in?""My Dad's a muggle.""Really? My Dad's muggle born so I have muggle grandparents. What about your Mum?"Annie went quiet."Hey, what's wrong?" Tonks asked looking worried."My Mum died when I was little." She replied quietly."I am so sorry! Really, I didn't know! I always say something stupid-""Tonks, seriously, it's fine.""You sure?""Yeah. Anyway, I've still got Dad.""Okay. Hey, Annie?""Yeah Tonks?""If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here. Even if we're put into different houses.""Thanks Tonks.""â€¦What do you want to be when you're older?""I'm not sure. I know I want to do something to do with magic and helping people."Tonks nodded."Maybe you could be a healer. It's sort of the magical version of a muggle doctor.""Hmmâ€¦Maybe.""I want to be an Auror." Tonks said proudly."What's that?""They're specially trained officers who catch dark wizards.""That sounds cool. So they're like police?""Yeah."There was a moment of silence until Tonks asked;"Do you want to play Exploding Snap?""What's that?"Tonks looked at her, dumbfounded."You've never heard of Exploding Snap?" Annie shook her head."No, I've heard of Snap though.""Oh, the muggle game! Yeah, I once played that with Dad. Exploding Snap is a lot similar though. And more fun.""Ok, how do you play?"The two girls then spent the rest of the train ride playing exploding snap, oblivious to the world outside the compartment.Please review.

I'm going to watch it, so this fanfic could be update a few more times today while I'm waiting for it.To the world you may be just one person, but to one person you may be the world.-Brandi Snyder1ST September 1984"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit upon the stool to be sorted." Professor McGonagall said. Annie stood next to Tonks, both nervous and dressed in their plain school robes. On her other side, a boy with red hair stood next to her. Probably related to little Ron and Mr Weasley, Annie thought. They, along with the other first years, where stood in the Great Hall of Hogwarts. Around them, where the four house tables, as well as the long staff table at the front of the hall. A long stool stood before the first years, on it was a thread bare hat. At the sight of this, Annie relaxed. She and Tonks did not know what to expect for the sorting. There was a rumour going round that they had to fight a troll! Needless to say, Annie was relieved when she saw the hat."Ainsworth, Annie!" Professor McGonagall said. Oh no, that's me, Annie thought. Tonks gave her a small, encouraging nudge and Annie walked through the crowd. Just stay calm, she thought. You just have to put on a hat. Annie sat on the chair, and place the hat on her head. It was so big that it covered Annie's eyes."First one this year." A voice said. No, the hat said. The hat was speaking. "Let's see, brave, loyal, quite intelligent, you value friendship. Hard working, willing to listen to the truth, very kind. You belong in-HUFFLEPUFF!"The hat shouted. The table on the far right cheered loudly, so Annie took off the hat and half ran to the Hufflepuff table. She sat next to a smiling fifth year who moved up the table to make room. Around five other first years joined the Hufflepuff table before 'Tonks, Nymphadora' was announced. Annie watched eagerly as her friend was sorted.'HUFFLEPUFF!' The hat cried. Annie clapped loudly as Tonks came to sit next to her, tripping at the last minute. Thankfully, not many people saw. Tonks sat next to Annie as they watched the rest of the sorting. The last person to be sorted was 'Weasley, Charles'. Definitely related to Mr Weasley, Annie thought. The moment the hat touched his flaming red hair, the hat cried 'GRYFFINDOR!'Annie and Tonks talked to all the other Hufflepuffs. Annie was marvelled by the food that appeared seemingly out of thin air. It was nice, but not as nice as the food from the restaurant. At one point, Tonks turned to Annie and said; "You know what? I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship."Please Review

Last update of the day. This is it, the reason why Annie hates Charlie Weasley. It may seem a bit pathetic but I'm not the best at these sort of things. The spell in this chapter was from a website on the internet. Disclaimer; I own nothing but my OC, AnnieMistakes are always forgiveable, if one has the courage to admit them.- Bruce Lee3rd September 1984Annie and Tonks stood outside the Transfiguration classroom with their fellow Hufflepuffs and the other first years from the three other houses. They all stood close to people from their own houses, Annie especially. Professor McGonagall let them into the classroom but made them all stand at the back of the classroom."Transfiguration is one of the more complex subjects you will learn." She said. "It requires hard work and dedication. Anyone who is not prepared to work to their limit of their capabilities should leave now."No one moved so she continued."As your year is the smallest Hogwarts has seen for at least fifty years, all four houses will have the same timetable. Usually, only two houses would be in this lesson. Also, our Headmaster wants to promote house unity, so in this lesson, I will sit you next to someone of a different house."Annie stood patiently as the Professor called up different people and sat them at desks. Tonks was one of the first people to be called. When she left, she offered Annie one last encouraging smile."Now," Professor McGonagall said. "Macmillan, Flint, Ainsworth and Weasley. That row there, please. And in that order."Annie walked to her seat, dumped her bag and sat down. Charlie Weasley sat next to Annie, on her right, while a blonde hair boy sat on her left. He gave her a disgusted look, almost as if she smelt. Professor McGonagall started off her lesson by transfiguring her desk into a pig and back. This earned a lot of applause of the class. All except, the boy next to Annie. He wore an arrogant smirk on his face, almost as if he thought he was too good for this lesson. For the first lesson, Professor McGonagall gave them all a match and everyone had to try and transfigure it into a needle. After a few attempts, Annie managed to do it."Well done, Miss Ainsworth. You have no homework. Please, help Mr Weasley with his matchstick." Annie turned to Charlie who was reciting the spell."Igniculus Veracum" He kept repeating, waving his wand in the air. Annie frowned."You're saying it wrong." She said quietly. Charlie suddenly stopped and turned to look at her."What?" He said."The spell? You're saying it wrong. You're saying it Ig-ni-CU-lus Ver-ac-UM when really it's Ig-NI-cu-lus Ver-AC-um." Charlie went bright red."No one like's a know-it-all." He scowled. Annie went silent, tears in her eyes. She hate being called names. She had thought he would have been nicer, what with being a Weasley. Her lip curled."Fine then. I won't help you."She stayed silent for the rest of the lesson, arms folded, refusing to talk the Charlie. When the bell signalling the end of the lesson rang, Annie had already packed away her books so she made a beeline for the door. Unfortunately, she was not the only one. She bumped into someone, causing her to fall over. Standing over her, was Flint, the Slytherin boy she had to sit next to. He was handsome, there was no question about that. Dark blonde hair, blue eyes, tall in height, he reminded her of one of the boys at her muggle school. The next words he said reminded her even more of the boys. The boys who used to bully her. Instead of helping her up, or picking her things up for her, he just glared at her."Watch where you're going, Mudblood." He growled, before stalking off. Yet again, Annie had tears in her eyes. She quickly got up, dusted off her robes and began to pick up the books that had fallen out of her bag. Someone else began to help but when Annie looked up, it was the last person she wanted to see."What do you want? Here to rub it in my face?" Charlie Weasley stood in front of her, squirming awkwardly."Look, I'm sorry about what happened. I over reacted but no one deserves to be called a Mudblood, no even you-""What's that supposed to mean?!" Charlie squirmed even more."Nothing! I just think-""I don't give a damn about what you think. Just leave me alone!" Annie exclaimed before storming off. She nearly walked into Tonks, but Tonks quickly jumped out of the way."Annie, are you okay?" Tonks asked. Annie quickly shook her head and explained what had happened. "Look, Annie, boys are idiots! Who needs them? Certainly not us.""Yeah, boys are idiots." Annie agreed, drying her eyes on her sleeve. "Who needs them?"Please Review.

Hello again. Your update for the day. Hope you enjoy it. I hope I have the canon characters written well, their sometimes hard to write. I own nothing but my OC characters.A man is like a cat; chase him and he will run - sit still and ignore him and he'll come purring at your feet.- Helen Rowland.1st September 1988"Look at you, Miss Hufflepuff prefect!" Tonks said, walking up behind Annie, who was saying goodbye to her father."We all knew you wouldn't get it, the amount of trouble you get in to." Annie replied, turning to face Tonks."Well, at least now I'll get less detentions!" Tonks laughed, as did Annie and her father."I'll see you at Christmas, Daddy." Annie said, hugging him goodbye."Bye, sweetheart. Don't give her too many detentions!" He said, motioning to Tonks, who grabbed Annie's had and dragged her towards the train."Where are we going?" Annie asked."The compartment!""But I have to go to the prefect's meeting!""Yeah, but I need someone to walk with!" Annie rolled her eyes, but said nothing. She had gotten used to Tonks' antics over the years."Got any plans for Quidditch this year, oh fearless leader?""Yes actually. You seeker, me chaser. Who knows for the other positions?""Tonks! We have to win this year! Then we can so rub it in Gryffindor's face! They've won too many times.""I know. But I'd rather Gryffindor win than Slytherin." Tonks reasoned."I think I'd rather Slytherin win. Charlie Weasley is Captain of Gryffindor and his head's already large enough as it is!""You're still holding that against him?""Yes. Now start think about the Quidditch team! We have to win!""I agree with you about winning, not so much you're whole feud with Charlie Weasley. I still think you fancy him.""Tonks! How could you even say that?!""Just my personal opinion!" They reached their usual compartment. All of their stuff was already there."Okay, you can go now.""What, that's the good bye I get?" Annie joked."Yep. But don't put me in detention for it, Miss Prefect!" Tonks laughed. "Okay then, see you later. Enjoy your whole prefect meeting thing.""Thanks. And you start thinking about Quidditch try outs!" Annie called as she walked away. She could hear Tonks mutter and Annie laughed.The prefect compartment was at the other end of the train. Annie began to walk towards it, passing numerous of excited students, ranging from first years who ran round excitedly, to seventh years, who were making the most of their last year. Before going into the meeting, Annie stopped to check her appearance. She had changed a lot since first year, over the summer especially. Her blonde hair hung in pretty ringlets which fell to just below her shoulders, her face was smooth and spot free, and the spark in her chocolate brown eyes seemed to light up her face when smiled. Sighing she walked into the compartment. With the exception of the Head Boy and Girl, who were talking quietly in the corner, there was only one other prefect in the compartment. Much to her chagrin, the other prefect was Charlie Weasley.Now, what you need to know is that Annie did not intentionally hold a grudge against him. In fact, on multiple occasions, she had in fact tried to look past the incident in that first year Transfiguration lesson, but whenever Charlie Weasley opened his mouth, Annie had an urge to slap him. But there was a good reason. You see, every word Annie had heard him utter was something very self-centred and to do with nothing but him. About how was going to be a great Dragonologist. How, thanks to his brilliant catch, Gryffindor won the house cup. Every time Annie saw him, that's all he would talk about. And now, there he was, sitting lazily on a seat, arrogant smirk on his face. Annie tried to ignore him, so she walked straight past him, and sat on a chair on the opposite side of the compartment. Charlie, however, clearly wanted to talk."Hey Ainsworth, good summer?" He'd say, or "Ainsworth, have you done the homework for Kettleburn? I haven't!"Annie clenched her fists tightly. To be polite, she answered with short, curt responses. All she wanted to was to go over there and slap him. How could he have not do the homework for the one subject he clearly needed? Did he want to be a Dragonologist or not? Fortunately, Annie was saved when her fellow Hufflepuff prefect walked in, Adam Cartwright. When he saw Annie, he smiled widely."Hi Annie! Good summer?""Hi Adam. Yeah it was alright, I just helped round the restaurant. How was your summer?" Just as Adam was about to reply, Charlie cut him off."Oi, Cartwright! We were having a private conversation before you interrupted it!" Charlie exclaimed."Oh, sorry, I'll just sit down-""Don't worry about it Adam. Weasley was finished anyway." Annie said to Adam, clearly trying to ignore Charlie."What?! No we weren't! We-" Charlie began but he was quickly silenced by a murderous look from Annie. Instead, he grumbled to himself as Annie and Adam chatted away.Soon, the compartment began to fill up with other prefects. It wasn't long before the Head Boy and Girl silenced them and began the meeting. Annie didn't recognise the Head Girl, a seventh year Ravenclaw, but she recognised the Head Boy. Bill Weasley, Charlie's older brother."Right. Hello then. I'm Bill Weasley, Head boy. This is Lacey Abrams, the Head Girl. To all the new prefects, welcome, and congratulations on becoming prefects." He turned to look at Lacey, who nodded."Being a prefect," She said. "Is not as easy as you may think it is. Yes, you are allowed to take away points and give out detentions, if, and only if, there is a valid reason. As a prefect, it is your responsibility to ensure that anyone, no matter their age or house, feels happy and safe in Hogwarts. If you abuse this power, your prefect privileges will be revoked.""If you have any questions," Bill said. "Come and speak to either Lacey or myself. We're always, willing to listen to any problems you may have."Across the compartment, Annie saw Charlie scoff and roll his eyes."As prefect," Bill continued. "It is our job to patrol the corridors of the school, make sure that first years settle in properly, and to help with seasonal tasks like putting up the Christmas decorations.""Also, you all have access to the Prefect's bathroom on the fifth floor." Lacey added. "Any questions?" She asked, but no one raised their hand."Great. Oh, and one last thing." Bill said. "The Headmaster wants the prefects to promote house unity so when we're at school, you will be doing your patrols with a prefect from another house."Oh no, Annie said, her heart sinking. She saw Charlie Weasley straighten up slightly and begin to pay more attention. Bill began to read names of a list, pairing up different prefects. The two things they both had in common was that the combinations were boy-girl, and both were from the same year. Bill then turned to face Annie."Annie Ainsworth?" He asked and she nodded. "Good, you're with-" His eyes scanned over the list. "Charlie Weasley."Annie internally groaned. From across the room, she could have sworn she saw Charlie grin widely.Please review.

Here is the first of two chapter updates today. Hope you enjoy.Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much-Helen Keller3th March 1989"Alright! Is everyone ready?" Tonks asked the Hufflepuff Quidditch team.The whole team, Annie included, where sitting in the Hufflepuff changing rooms, waiting for the game to begin. Tonks stood in front of the team, dressed in her canary yellow Quidditch robes. Annie was sitting next to Michael McMillian and Daisy Melbourne, the other two chasers. Daisy was in sixth year, while Michael was in fifth, like Annie and Tonks. The two beaters, Simon Bennet and Alastair Smith, sat on the other side of Michael while the keeper, Jack Cauldwell, sat next to Daisy. Simon and Alastair were both in forth year and Jack was in seventh year.A chorus of 'Yes's' went around the room and Tonks smiled."Okay! So, we're playing Gryffindor today and if we want to win the House Cup, we have to bet them today. We only just won against Ravenclaw and we have to be in a good position for when we play Slytherin. Annie, make sure you catch the snitch when we're at least 50 points up."Annie nodded and Tonks continued."Right then. No one end up in the hospital or I'll kill them!" She threatened and everyone burst out laughing. "What?" She asked."Tonks, we all know that if anyone will end up in the hospital wing, it'll be you!" Annie explained. Tonks blushed."Oh alright then. But seriously, play carefully!"They all followed Tonks out of the changing room and on to the Quidditch pitch. Annie was right behind her, carrying her broomstick, a Comet 260. Her father had bought it for her when she was made prefect, replacing her old Cleansweep Five. Madam Hooch was refereeing the game. Annie shuddered at the memory of Professor Snape refereeing the Hufflepuff vs Slytherin match the previous year. Needless to say, they did not win. The Hufflepuff team took their positions on the field, while the Gryffindors did the same."Captains, shake hands!" Madam Hooch said. Tonks walked forward, as did Charlie Weasley. Tonks kept her face expressionless while Charlie smirked. For a second, his eyes flickered towards Annie, who kept her head forward and ignored him."Mount your brooms, please!"Annie gripped the handle and scrambled on to her broom. The whistle rang shrilly, and Annie kicked off the ground, along with all the other players."And the Quaffle is taken by Nymphadora Tonks, who passes it to Daisy Melbourne." The commentator, Elsa Wilson â€“ a Seventh year Ravenclaw â€“ announced. "Followed by a neat pass to McMillian. McMillian takes his aim, and Gryffindor Keeper, Oliver Wood â€“misses â€“ That's 10 points to Hufflepuff!"The cheers of the Hufflepuff crowds filled the stadium. Annie hovered around, keeping an eye out for the snitch, and Charlie Weasley, who was keeping close to her. Hufflepuff scored another four goals while Gryffindor scored three. 50 to 30. Annie knew she would have to find the snitch now, before Gryffindor over took them. Annie looked frantically round the pitch, searching for the small gold ball. Thenâ€¦There! There it was, hovering near to one of the spectator stands. She looked around and saw that Charlie hadn't seen it yet. It was now or never, she had to get it before he did.Not wasting a second, Annie leaned forward and shot off towards the golden glimmer in the distance. She was certain that Charlie had seen it now, or that he was following her. Come on, she thought. You can do this! She was nearly there. Annie could hear the cheers of the crowd, willing her to catch the snitch. Just a few more meters, she thought. They were very high up. It's a good thing I'm not scared of height, Annie said in her head.Just as her hand clasped the golden snitch, she felt something (or someone), crash into her. Hand still clamped round the snitch, she fell from her broom. She was falling. And screaming. Annie saw the grass coming towards her so she closed her eyes and everything went black.Please review.

Second chapter. Please enjoy! P.S. I made up Charlie's middle name."The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury." -Marcus Aurelius6th March 1989"Annie? Annie, wake up." A voice said. Annie tried to open her eyes, but it was like they were glued shut. She couldn't move. She couldn't feel her fingers. Everything was black. After a while, a tingling sensation went through her body and she slowly began to regain control. She could feel her fingers move at her command and she tried to open her eyes again. After a few attempts, her eyes fluttered open and Annie groaned at what she saw. She was in the Hospital Wing."About time!" Annie heard the familiar voice of Tonks say. Annie rolled her eyes and grinned. Tonks was sitting in the chair next to her bed, reading the copy of Quidditch Through the Ages, Annie had gotten Tonks for Christmas. "Annie, are you ok?" Tonks asked."Urgh, what happened? How long have I been out for?" Annie groaned."Well, do you want the good news or the bad news first?""Good news I guess?""We won the match!" Tonks cried happily. "All because of you!"Annie chuckled. Trust Tonks to make light of a bad situation."OK, and the bad news?" Annie asked, a little unsurely."Charlie Weasley accidentally crashed into you, causing you to fall about, what? 50 feet? So, now you have to spend all weekend in the Hospital wing!""What day is it now?""Monday morning." Tonks said simply. "Madam Pomfrey says that you have to take your medication, then you're free to go."Annie smiled and looked at the clock. If they we're quick, they could still make it to breakfast in time. Madam Pomfrey soon came round, check Annie's vital signs, gave her a cup of vile tasting medicine, and sent Annie on her way. Tonks wrapped an arm around Annie's waist, as Annie was still a bit wobbly on her legs when walking. They soon, however, made it to the Great Hall with no problems.The minute the two walked into the Great Hall, loud applause sound from the Hufflepuff table. Annie grinned, as did Tonks."See? Even when you fall off your broom you still managed to win the game for us!" Tonks exclaimed and Annie laughed.They took their usual seats and immediately numerous Hufflepuffs came over to congratulate Annie."Great catch, Annie." Adam said, sitting in the seat next to her. "But we were all really worried about you when you fell. Some of the first years thought you were dead!""Well, I'm happy I'm not." Annie smiled, sipping her pumpkin juice."Come on, Annie. Madam Pomfrey said you have to eat." Tonks said, pushing a plate of toast towards her. Annie stuck her tongue out, jokingly, but began to eat the toast. Everyone was quite for a few minutes, until Tonks started speaking again."Look who it is." She said, pointing at a figure who had walked into the Great Hall. Annie looked up and saw Charlie Weasley walk in, closely followed by his two brothers. Charlie's eyes scanned the Hufflepuff table until his gaze fell upon Annie. He began to walk towards her until he was pulled back by his older brother. Bill whispered what looked like stern words into his brothers ears before sitting down at the Gryffindor table. Although hesitant, Charlie sulked after him."He came in to the Hospital Wing, you know." Tonks said. Annie broke her gaze and turned to face her."What?""After the accident. He came to see you.""Why?"Tonks shrugged."Don't know. Probably to apologise. However, he didn't get close enough to.""How so?""Wouldn't let him. Threaten to jinx him if he tried.""Tonks! You know, he could have given you a detention. He is a prefect.""Don't care. Anyway, I think Professor Sprout would have let me off. He's kind of Hufflepuff enemy number one right now."Annie laughed."You're a great friend, did you know that?""Yep. Best friend number one, me."Annie just smiled and went back to eating her breakfast. It wasn't long before owls arrived with the post. Barney, Annie's owl landed, with a worried letter from her father. She was in the middle of reading it, when she was distracted by a rather large voice."CHARLES SEPITMUS WEASLEY!" The voice rang out through the Hall. All attention was directed to the Gryffindor table were a red face Charlie Weasley sat. In front of him, was a scarlet red howler."This should be good." Tonks muttered."HOW DARE YOU HURT THAT POOR GIRL! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED HER! I AM ABOSLUTLY DISGUSTED WITH YOU! WHY, I SHOULD STOP LETTING YOU PLAY QUIDDITCH ENTIRLY!"A collective gasp sounded from the Gryffindor table."-AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE TO SET TO YOUR SIBLINGS! IT IS SUCH BAD SPORTSMANSHIP TO KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT OUT OF THE SKY WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THEY HAVE THE SNITCH! YOU MARCH YOU TO THAT HOSPITAL WING AND APOLOGISE TO THAT GIRL THIS INSTANT! YOU SHOULD HAVE APOLOGISED ALREADY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT'S SHE'S UNCONSIOUS! WHEN YOU GET HOME, YOUR BROOM PRIVLEDGES ARE REVOCKED, YOUNG MAN! DON'T YOU PUT EVEN ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, CHARLES WEASLEY!"The Howler then exploded, leaving a mess of burnt paper around Charlie, whose face was red and terrified.Please review.

This is the first of three updates because I probably won't be able to update tomorrow. Please enjoy.People don't just get upset. They contribute to their upsetness -Albert Ellis8th March 1989Annie was late. Very late. She ran past little first years, trying not to knock them over, in hope that she would make it in time for patrols. At the moment, it didn't look very likely. But still, she had to try. Tonight's patrol was with Charlie Weasley, much to Annie's joy. If she arrived late, he would never let her forget it. Usually, she was early for patrols but after last lesson â€“ Divination- her leg was hurting from the long walk. Although mostly healed, Annie still experience periods of pain in her leg that she had landed on, along with a big, purple bruise. Tonks had urged her to go back to the Hospital Wing, but Annie waved it off. She didn't want to trouble Madam Pomfrey, who was busy enough, or receive any more pity than she already had.Annie checked her watch quickly. She had five minutes to get to the sixth floor. Why did she decide to stop by the common room? She just had to be dragged into that game of Exploding Snap, didn't she? Dodging some third year Gryffindors on their way to the library, Annie reached the third floor. Just three more floors to go. Annie groaned. It seemed to take forever, but Annie finally reached the sixth floor. She groaned, however, at the sight which met her eyes.There stood Charlie Weasley, lazily leaning against the wall, not a care in the world. When he saw Annie, his eyes lit up."You're not usually late, Ainsworth." He smirked."Yeah? Well you usually are. Snitch on me and I'll tell your brother just how many times you've been late, or just not bother to show up." Annie snapped. Charlie held his hands up in defence."Ok! Calm down. What's wrong with you?""Nothing. Come on, we'll start up the Towers, then patrol round the floors." Annie said."Sounds good to me." Charlie replied.They started walking up towards Gryffindor Tower, up the Grand Staircase. Annie was careful not trip up on the vanishing step. After the amount of times that Tonks had tripped up on it, Annie began to memorise where it appeared."So thenâ€¦" Charlie said."What?" Annie said, irritated. She did not need this. She had a splitting head ache, her leg was aching and she felt dizzy. On top of all that, she had a ton of homework to catch up on, and revision of her O. ."Nothing. Just making conversation. You know, being friendly."Annie nodded stiffly and went back to being silent. It was obvious that Charlie wanted to talk though."What did you make of last week's Care of Magical Creatures lesson?""It was good.""Yeah. It would have been better if I could see the Thestrals, though. You know, to study them. Although, there supposed to be bad omens, according to Trelawney.""I think they're misunderstood." Charlie stopped to look at her, eyebrows raised."You can see them?""Yes." Annie replied quietly."Who did you see die?""â€¦My Mum."Charlie was silent for a minute."Look, I'm sorry for asking. And I'm sorry about the whole Quidditch thing.""It's alright. You didn't know." Annie walked ahead, leaving Charlie behind, but he quickly caught up."Annie are you ok?" He asked, looking worried."I'm fine." Annie replied quickly."Are you sure? You don't look it.""I said I'm fine!" Annie snapped, quieting Charlie. "Ohâ€¦I'm sorry. It's just I have a killer head ache and-""Annie, look out!" Charlie shouted. Annie's landed on a vanishing step, which obviously vanished causing Annie to slip and fall, banging her hair on the step above."Annie, are you ok?!" Charlie's garbled words were the last things she heard before she fell into darkness.Please review.

Second update. Hope Charlie doesn't seem a bit too OCC. In this chapter, it's his POV so you get to hear about his feelings! Enjoy!To burn with desire and keep quiet about it is the greatest punishment we can bring on ourselves.-Federico Garcia Lorca10th March 1989Charlie Weasley, for the first time in his life, did not know what to do. Now, for those who knew Charlie Weasley, this was a first. Although he never planned anything, Charlie usually managed to make the most of a situation, and pull everything out of the bag at the last minute. Now, however, was not one of these moments. Laying in front of him, was an unconscious girl. To most people, this would be a simple thing to fix, you would check to see if the girl was alright, and take her to someone who could care for her. However, when this girl hated your guts, it tends to make things a bit harder. Especially when a few days previous, you accidentally knocked her off her broom, causing her to be unconscious for the entire weekend. Needless to say, Charlie was faced with quite a big problem.It also didn't help when said boy had one of the biggest crushes on the girl. Yes, you heard it, Charlie Weasley fancied Annie Ainsworth. It was quite a well-kept secret, the only person Charlie had told was his older brother, Bill, who had managed to force out of him. Because of this, when Bill was told he had to pair up prefects from opposite houses, he purposely put Charlie and Annie together. However, this wasn't the problem. The problem was that Annie hated Charlie. The whole Hogwarts population knew that. That hate was now amplified by the Quidditch match. Charlie found himself on the wrong end of vicious, Hufflepuff oriented comments after her landed their seeker in the Hospital Wing. Annie was one of the most well liked Hufflepuffs so that put him in a bad position. And in the bad books with his Mum. That was why Bill had prevent him from going over to talk to Annie on Monday morning. Bill was being the typical older brother, helping at the times where Charlie least needed help. Where was Bill when Charlie faced an inner conflicting battle after the first transfiguration lesson? Oh, how Charlie wished he could turn the clock back, so that lesson never happened. That day hadn't been a good day for Charlie. He and Bill had a massive argument over something small and trivial, leading to Charlie snapping at Annie, firing Annie's burning hate towards him.This, however, was Charlie's chance of redemption. Very carefully, he scooped up Annie in his arms, positioning her so that she would be comfy. Not that it matter's, he thought. She's unconscious anyway. They were quite close to the Hospital Tower, meaning that Charlie didn't have far to carry Annie. Not that he couldn't manage. Annie seemed lighter than one of the twins by themselves. There weren't many students around so Charlie managed to get to the Hospital Wing quickly.The Hospital Wing was mostly empty, with the exception of a few younger years who were recovering from cold."Madam Pomfrey!" Charlie called. The Matron soon came bustling out of her office, bottle of medicine in hand. When she saw Charlie holding the unconscious Annie, she nearly dropped it."My goodness! What happened?" She asked putting the medicine down."Tripped on the Vanishing step and hit her head. And she said she had a really bad headache before she did." Charlie replied, shifting Annie's weight from one arm to another."Ok, put her down on that bed over there." Madam Pomfrey said, pointing to a bed. Charlie nodded, and gently place her on the bed. The Matron hurried round, gathering numerous potions."Out you go. I can't have you hanging round. I'll give you a shout when she wakes up."Reluctantly, Charlie nodded and left the room.Please review.

Last update. Hope you enjoyed them, as well as Charlie's POV, and the new character in this chapter. Until next time.I was in love, and the feeling was even more wonderful than I ever imagined it could be-Nicholas Sparks10th March 1989When Annie's eyes fluttered open, she groaned. Not again, she thought. For the second time this week, she was laying on a bed in the Hospital Wing. The curtains around her bed were drawn so she sat up. Annie could hear raised voices on the other side of the cubical. Both of which, she recognised."What the hell are you doing here, Weasley?!" The easily distinguished voice of Tonks shouted."I was the one who brought her here!" Much to Annie's surprise, the voice of Charlie Weasley said back.Memories of what happened came flooding back, causing Annie to sigh and flop back down on to the bed. Bloody Vanishing Step. Whose idea was it to put an invisible step in a school full of students? But then, it was her own fault for not paying attention to where she was walking."I'll hex your bloody arse off Charles Weasley! This is the second time you've landed Annie in Hospital this week!" Tonks shouted, causing both Annie and Charlie to whimper."But I didn't do anything! She tripped on the Vanishing step and hit her head! All I did was bring her here!" Charlie exclaimed. Annie chuckled slightly. Tonks was so defensive, if anything happened to Annie, she would be straight there, threatening any person she could. Tonks would make a great Auror someday.Annie thought it would be best to stop Tonks now, before she worked herself up and did some serious damage to Charlie. She got of the bed and opened the curtains and prepared herself for the sight that she met.Tonks and Charlie were both standing face to face. Tonks wore a murderous glare while Charlie looked terrified."What's going on?" Annie asked, mischievous smile on her face. Tonks and Charlie turned to face her, both smiling widely when they saw her."Annie! You're ok!" Tonks exclaimed, rushing forward to engulf Annie in a bone-breaking hug. "What happened?""It was my own stupid fault really." Annie said. "I tripped on the Vanishing step and knocked myself out. But I have no idea how I got here.""That was me, actually." Charlie said, stepping forward. Tonks gave him a murderous look, but he continued. "After you fell, I brought you here."Annie's face reddened as she realised what he meant. He had carried her to the Hospital Wing."Oh, well, umâ€¦Thank you, Charlie." Annie said, but there was still on thing on her mind. "Why are you still here, though?"This time, it was Charlie's turn to blush."Oh! Iâ€¦Umâ€¦Just wanted to make sure that you were ok." He said, looking anywhere but Annie's face."Really?...That'sâ€¦Umâ€¦Really kind of you. Thanks Charlie.""You're welcome." Charlie said. "Well, I'll just be goingâ€¦"Charlie quickly left the room, still bright red, making his hair look like fire. Tonks burst out laughing the moment he left."What?" Annie asked."Nothing. Just, you so fancy him!" Tonks giggled. Annie rolled her eyes."I do not!" Annie exclaimed. Tonks just looked at her, a knowing look in her eye."Of course you don't"Both girls burst out laughing, and after Madam Pomfrey had given Annie yet another dose of medicine, they made their way back to the Hufflepuff common room. They only, however, made it to Third Floor when they were stopped."Umâ€¦Hey Annie." Chris Redmayne, the Ravenclaw prefect, said. He was in the same year as the two girls, and was tall, with dark brown hair, and blue eyes."Ummâ€¦Hi Chris." Annie replied nervously. Chris was one of the most popular boys in fifth year. Every girl wanted to be with him, while every boy wanted to be him. Annie would be lying if she didn't admit that she herself didn't have at least a small crush on him. All the girls did."How are you feeling?" Chris asked."Oh fine." Annie replied, smiling."That's good. So, I was wondering, there's a trip to Hogsmeade next weekend. I was wondering if you, you know, would want to go with me?" He asked unsurely.Annie smiled shyly."Yeah, I'll go with you.""Really? I mean, that's great. I'll meet you outside the Great Hall, say about 10ish?""Yeah, that'll be great."Chris smiled, this time more confidently."Ok. I'll see you around then.""Yeah, bye Chris."Chris nodded and smiled widely, before turning to walk up towards Ravenclaw tower. Annie grinned, before turning to Tonks, who was also grinning."Look at you! Your first date! Oh, my little Annie is growing up.""Shove off." Annie said, still smiling.Please review.

Sorry about the delay on this chapter, I've just had so much homework to do. Yay, over 500 reads. Anyway, it's Annie's first date! Hope you enjoy this chapter.Consider the fellow. He never spends his time telling you about his previous night's date. You get the idea he has eyes only for you and wouldn't think of looking at another woman -Marilyn Monroe17th March 1989"Are you ready?" Tonks asked, looking over at Annie."I think so." Annie said, unsurely. "How do I look?"Tonks' smiled."Absolutely fantastic." She replied, looking at Annie's outfit.Annie smiled. She was wearing a knitted white jumper, dark wash jeans, her brown fir lined boots, and a grey scarf. Although it was March, the weather in Scotland was still quite cold, so Annie had her thick fleece jacket slung over her arm, as well as her brown messenger bag."Are you sure you're alright with me going with Chris? I can ask him if you could come too." Annie said, earning a stern look of Tonks."Don't you dare. This is your first date and you are going to enjoy yourself. Don't think about me, I have something planned." Tonks said firmly. Annie raised an eyebrow."What?""Oh, nothing much. Going to Zonko's to restock my supplies."Annie rolled her eyes. When both girls were ready, they headed up to breakfast. Annie could barely eat anything, she was that nervous. Soon, ten o'clock arrived, so she got up to leave."Oi, Annie." Tonks said. Annie turned to look at her. "Have a good time.""Thanks Tonks." Annie smiled, and she walked off to stand in the Entrance Hall. Chris wasn't there yet so she had a few minutes to herself.Annie felt as though everyone was looking at her. She knew they weren't, but she couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her. Merlin, she was nervous. What would she and Chris talk about? What if she bored him? What if she completely embarrassed herself in front of him? Deep in thought, she didn't notice someone walk up behind her until they tapped her on her shoulder. Annie turned around and smiled at who she saw."Hi Annie.""Hi Chris.""You look nice. Shall we?""We shall."They joined the queue of people waiting to get past Filch, the school Caretaker. It seemed to take forever, but at last they were outside, in the fresh air. There had been a light covering of snow the night before, and Annie laughed when she saw the first years running mad on one of the fields, having a fully-fledged snowball fight."Doesn't seem like five minutes since we were first years." Chris commented."I know. It was only five years ago that I found out about magic." Annie said, smiling at the memory of Professor Sprout telling her she was a witch. Who knew that she would end up in Professor Sprout's house?"What's it like, living with Muggles?" Chris asked."A bit strange now I know about magic." Annie admitted. "I mean, I can freely use magic at Hogwarts, but the minute I get home, I'm not. Like, at home I say, wash the dishes by hand, whereas at Hogwarts, I could have used magic."Chris nodded."Yeah, that is pretty frustrating.""And, since my Dad's a muggle, it's hard to describe what I do at school, because he can't do magic.""Wow. All my family can do magic so they know what to expect. Although, it does get annoying when my older brother keeps telling me what to expect. And when Mum keeps saying that I can do better in subjects."Annie nodded and they talked more about their home life. When they got to Hogsmeade, Chris stopped."So, where do you want to go?" He asked."Umâ€¦Honeydukes? I want to get my Dad something. It's his birthday soon, you see." Annie said."Ok, what are you going to get him?" Chris asked as they walked towards the Sweetshop."I'm not too sure. Maybe some toffee? He like's that. Or some Chocolate Frogs."Chris nodded and they entered the small shop, which was packed with Hogwarts students. Somehow, Annie and Chris managed to battle their way through students to the part of the shop which sold chocolates."Hmmmâ€¦Maybe some Honeydukes Chocolate? That stuffs great." Annie said."Yeah, it's the best." Chris agreed. "What's your favourite type of sweet?""Mint Humbugs." Annie replied, causing Chris to look confused. "It's a muggle sweet." She explained. "The sweetshop near where I live sells them.""Oh. What's your favourite wizard sweet then?" Chris asked."Ummâ€¦Chocolate Cauldrons. Tonks got me some for Christmas once and I really liked them." Annie said."Then I'm going to buy you some." Chris said, picking a box up."What? You can't, they're really expensive." Annie said."So, I don't care. I'm getting you a box.""Why?" Annie asked. Chris looked at her."Because, it's what boyfriends do." He said."Since when have I been your girlfriend?""Since now. Look, I really like you Annie. It's taken me five years to pluck up the courage to ask you out. Please be my girlfriend."Annie looked at him and smiled."Well, since you asked so nicely."Please review

Sorry about the delay, I've just been so busy. Hope you enjoy this chapter.Cat, I'll let you in on a little secret. We don't all love our jobs every day. And doing something you have passion for doesn't make the work part of it any easier...It just makes you less likely to quit.- Georgia, The Friday Night Club12th April 1989Annie walked into Professor Sprout's Office with a smile on her face."Hello, Professor Sprout." Annie said as she opened the door. Professor Sprout was sat behind her desk, marking what looked to be like first years Herbology homework. She looked up and smiled when Annie walked in."Hello, Miss Ainsworth. Please, take a seat." She said, beckoning to a seat on the other side of the desk. Annie nodded and sat down."Right then." Professor Sprout said, shuffling numerous pamphlets around. "First off, what did you think of the new plants in the common room?"Annie smiled. Trust Professor Sprout to begin talking about plants."They were lovely. I know some first years especially like the Leaping Toadstools. A few cats were chasing them as well."Professor Sprout chuckled."Well, at least they were well liked. What did you think of the Walking plant?""Oh, now that one was my favourite. I loved it, it was really entertaining to watch.""Good, good. Now then," Professor Sprout began. "Now then, this meeting is to discuss what career you may want to go in to, and what subjects would be best for you to take next year. Have you had any thoughts on what you want to do after Hogwarts?" She asked and Annie nodded."Yes, I've been thinking about being a Healer." Annie said and Professor Sprout nodded, looking for a pamphlets."Yes, very good choice. You seem very suited for that career but you'll need top marks for it." She said, picking out a stack of leaflets and gave them to Annie. "At least and E in Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, Charms and Defence against the Dark Arts at O. and the same at N.E. . I would also suggest Care of Magical Creatures as well, it's a good thing to have in that line of work."Annie nodded, flicking through a leaflet."You would also have to go through three years of training, as well as one year placement. It is a difficult career path, not many choose it. But, if you're willing to put the work in, I will do my best to ensure that you become a Healer."Annie nodded again, and Professor Sprout continued."Right then, Herbology, you're doing well in. Right now, you're averaging at an E, so you're on target. Potions, you're getting an E. Now, Professor Snape only accepts students who achieve an O at OWL level, so you'll have to put a lot of hard work in. Transfiguration is very good. Professor McGonagall is marking you at a high 'Exceeds Expectations'. Charms is satisfactory. You're somewhere between an 'Acceptable' and 'Exceeds Expectations' so you'll have to put a bit of work in there. Defence against the Dark Arts, you're getting an E, so you're on track. Now, your Care of Magical Creatures mark. Professor Kettleburn has marked you as an 'Outstanding', so you are doing great there. Overall, good marks. All I'd advise you to do is to keep studying. Make sure you know everything inside out. You have no idea how many students think there doing great then fail in the exams.""Ok Professor. Is that everything?""No, actually. If you are determined to be a Healer, for your placement, were would you want to go?""Ohâ€¦Ummâ€¦I'm not really sure.""Would you consider working at Hogwarts?" Professor Sprout asked."Oh! If I would be able to, then yes.""Ok, I'll keep that in mind. Not many people chose to be Healers as it a difficult Career. When the time come for you to choose a placement, simply send me an owl and I will try and arrange something."Annie's face lit up."Really, Professor?""Of course! You are a hard worker, all the Staff know that. They would be thrilled if you were to do your placement here.""Thank you, Professor." Annie said. Professor Sprout smiled."You're welcome. Now, off you go. I'm sure you have a lot to do."Please review

28th July 1989'Talking away, I don't know what I'm to say'Annie danced round the kitchen, listening to the music the radio played. It was early morning, around eight o'clock, and Annie was making herself some breakfast. She threw some bread into the toaster, filled the kettle up with water and put it to boil.'I'll say it anyway, Today isn't my day to find you'It was the summer holidays, and Annie had nothing planned. Except helping her Father round the restaurant. They were generally busier in the summer, there were a lot more tourists in the sleepy town during the summer.'Take on me, (take on me), Take me on (take on me), I'll be gone, in a day or two'The kettle began to whistle just as the toast popped out of the toaster. Annie took the kettle off the hob and place the toast onto a plate."Dad, do you want some breakfast?" Annie shouted down the stairs. Her father was downstairs, getting the restaurant ready for the busy day ahead."Yes please, Annie!" William Ainsworth called back. Annie nodded to herself and placed some more toast in the toaster. She then got two mugs out of the cupboard and placed a teabag in each. Filling each mug with water and milk, she put them on the table along with the plates of toast. Annie sat down and began to eat her breakfast. She was soon joined by her father."What have you got planned for today?" William asked."I think Tonks might be coming round." Annie replied and William nodded."When are you getting your exam results?""Ohâ€¦Ummâ€¦soon I think. They said sometime near the end of July.""Annie, it's the 28th today." William said. Annie began to panic."Already? Oh Merlin, how could I forget?"There was a screech outside of the window and Barn Owl hopped in. It held out its's leg, on which, was an envelope addressed;Miss Annie AinsworthThe Red DragonMoorside, Berwick-Upon-TweedNorthumberlandNervously, Annie untied the envelope, her fingers shaking. Neither Annie nor her father said anything. It seemed to take forever for Annie to open the letter. She took a deep breath, before taking the letter out of the envelope. Before she read it, her father stopped her."Annie, whatever that letter may say, just know I'm proud of you, not matter what you get." He said. Annie smiled and read the parchment.ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTSPass Grades: Outstanding (O) Exceeds Expectations (E) Acceptable (A)Fail Grades: Poor (P) Dreadful (D) Troll (T) ANNIE LAUREN AINSWORTH HAS ACHIEVEDAstronomy: A Arithmancy: ECare of Magical Creatures: OCharms: EDefence against the Dark Arts: EDivination: AHerbology: OHistory of Magic: DPotions: OTransfiguration: O Annie read and reread the piece of parchment, just to make sure it was real."How did you do?" William asked a bit unsurely. In response, Annie handed him the parchment and he read it. His face lit up."Annie! That's excellent! Congratulations." He said, wide smile on his face. Annie grinned too. The years' worth of hard work had paid off.Suddenly, there was a loud crack, and Tonks and her father Ted appeared. Tonks was holding an envelope identical to Annie."Wotcher Annie!" She exclaimed. "How did you do?!""Alright. I only failed History of Magic!""Same here! Let's swap."Annie quickly read the parchment. The results were similar, the only differences was that Tonks received an E in Divination and an A in Care of Magical Creatures and E's in Transfiguration and Herbology."Well done, Tonks!""Same to you, Annie!" Tonks grinned. "Me and Dad are going to Diagon Alley, do you want to come?"Annie turned to look at her father."Please Dad?""Of course, sweetheart." He replied.Grinning, Annie turned back to Tonks."Let's go then!"

Hello readers. I've decided that I'm going to update this story ever Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the next few weeks. Mostly because on a school night I just have a tonne of homework to do. Please enjoy!Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else. And that makes me quite nervous. - Oscar Wilde16th August 1989"Hi Chris." Annie said nervously as she opened the front door."Hey Annie." Chris smiled. He was dressed in a dark blue dress shirt, black slacks, and leather shoes. "You look really nice.""Thank you Chris." Annie said, blushing slightly. She was wearing a dark red dress, black flats and her hair was curled to perfection."I, Ur, got you these." Chris said, handing her a bouquet of sunflowers. "I know they're your favourite.""Thanks Chris. Come on in, Dad's in the kitchen. I'll get a vase to put these in." Annie replied, leading Chris inside. He had come to the back entrance as the front door was the restaurant's door. They walked up the stairs to the flat onto of the apartment. The stairs lead to a spacious living room/dining room."Dad!" Annie called. "Chris is here!""OK, Annie!" William Ainsworth shouted back."I'll be back in a minute, Chris. Just take a seat." Annie said gesturing to the settee. Chris nodded and smiled as he sat down. Annie smiled to before walking in to the kitchen."Those are pretty." William said, nodding at the flowers. "You going to put them in some water?""Yeah Dad." Annie smiled, getting a vase out of the cupboard. She filled it up with water and placed the flowers in them. "I'm going to put these on the table, ok?""Ok, Annie. I'll be through in a minute."Annie walked back into the living room, put the flowers on the table and then sat on the settee next to Chris."What's that?" He asked, pointing to the television."It's a television. You watch programmes on it." Annie explained."Wow.""Dinner's ready!" William shouted."Ok Dad!" Annie shouted back. "Come on." She said, taking Chris's hand and leading him to the table. They sat on either side of the table, so that William sat at the head. "I'll be back in a minute. I'm just going to give Dad a hand."She walked into the kitchen and turned to her father."What need's taking out?""Annie! Go back through there. It's your night!" William exclaimed, ladling soup into bowls. Annie rolled her eyes, but never the less, she walked back out, but picked up the bread board as she left. She set it down on the table just as William appeared carrying three soup bowls."Here you go." He said, putting the bowls down. "House speciality. Vegetable soup.""It looks great." Chris said."Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks. Help yourself to bread, Chris." William replied.At first they eat in silence, savouring the flavour. Until William began to make conversation."So, Chris, what do you want to do when you leave Hogwarts?" He asked."I want to work in the Ministry of Magic" Chris replied."That sound fascinating.""Yeah, it is.""What part of the Ministry do you want to work in?""The Department of Magical Law Enforcement, sir.""What is it you would be doing? And please, don't call me sir, it makes me feel old.""Well, you are getting on a bit Dad." Annie said, causing everyone to laugh."At first, I would be working in the Magical Law Enforcement Squad but eventually I want to work as a Hit Wizard.""What's that?" William asked."They're like Aurors but more qualified. They hunt Dark Wizards. It's a really dangerous job, but the pay's great."William nodded."Sounds good. You'd best be careful when you work there, don't want you to break every bone in your body. Annie, can you give me a hand serving the main?" He asked."Sure Dad."The two Ainsworths got up, picked up the empty soup bowls and the bread board, and went into the kitchen."What do you think of him Dad?" Annie asked, dumping the dishes in the sink."He seems nice." William shrugged."Nice? That's it?""Well what else can I say?""I don't know! I just thought there would be something a bit better than 'nice'."William sighed and turned to face Annie."Chris seems like a well enough, reasonable young boy who will treat you right.""Thanks Dad. That's better.""And if he ever hurts you, I'll break every bone in his body.""Dad!"Please review!

Second update of the weekend. Yay! Two more follows! Now, if only there were more reviews...Enjoy!From the deepest desires often come the deadliest hate- Socrates5th September 1989"Tonks! I can't believe you didn't take on Care of Magical Creatures." Annie whined, as she and Tonks sat in the Great Hall. It was breakfast time and around them students milled around, eating breakfast and catching up with friends."You know I couldn't! I only got an A, remember?" Tonks replied, eating her bacon. Annie sighed."I know. I just don't want to be the only one in Care of Magical Creatures.""You won't be. I know someone else who is taking it?" Tonks said, causing Annie to perk up."Who?" She asked curiously."Charlie Weasley." Tonks grinned and Annie groaned."Why him? Out of everyone in sixth year, it had to be him!""I thought you agreed he wasn't that bad now.""Exactly. Not that bad. He is still a nightmare, just a slightly less big one." Tonks rolled her eyes."I still think you fancy him.""Tonks!" Annie exclaimed. "I have a boyfriend!""Yeah," Tonks said. "And here he comes."Annie's head snapped round and she smiled when she saw Chris walking towards her from the Ravenclaw table."Hey Annie." Chris said, kissing her before sitting down. "Hi Tonks.""Hi Chris." Annie and Tonks said. Tonks went back to her breakfast while Annie talked to Chris."What lesson do you have first?" Annie asked."Muggle Studies. You?""Care of Magical Creatures."Chris nodded. They talked more, about school, the holidays, the lessons they'd taken on. It was until Tonks said it, did Annie even know what time it was."Annie?" She said. "Shouldn't you be going now?""What?" Annie asked, a bit dazed."Your lesson. It starts in five minutes and it's outside on the grounds."Annie eyes widened and she cursed. Quickly grabbing her bag, she said a rushed goodbye to her friends before running out the Great Hall, dodging younger years. She turned to exit the Hall, when she ran into two little first years. They all landed on the floor, dropping their bags."Oh! Sorry!" Annie cried, picking herself off the floor. Upon closer inspection, Annie saw that the first years she had knocked over were twins, both with fiery red hair she recognised."Hey! We know you!" The first twin exclaimed."Yeah! You're that girl!""What girl?" Annie asked as she picked up her bag."That girl Charlie knows!"Annie stopped. So she was right."You're related to Charlie?" She asked. The twins nodded."You're the girl Charlie knocked off her broom!""That made Mum really angry.""Yeah, she sent a Howler, didn't she?" The twins nodded again."We would have loved to have seen his reaction." The first twin said."Yeah, it would have been priceless!" The second twin added."Yeah, it kinda was. Listen, I'm really late, so just, you know, get to your lessons on time and all that stuff."Not giving them a chance to reply, Annie ran off again, leaving the twins in the Entrance Hall. Annie raced down the Castle steps and ran towards the field where the lesson usually took place. She quickly checked her watch. Yep, she was late. Annie down the hill, and saw the lone student she recognised to be Charlie Weasley. Oh great, she thought. She slowed down just as she reached him, panting heavily."Hey Ainsworth." Charlie said. "Kettleburn's going to be late. Didn't you get the message?""What?" She breathed."Kettleburn is late." He said clearly. Annie's eyes narrowed."You mean to say," She said darkly. "I ran all the way here, bumped into your little brothers, and missed eating breakfast and Professor Kettleburn isn't even here?!""Ummâ€¦Yes?" Charlie said, a little scared. Annie Ainsworth was one person you didn't want to be on the wrong side of.Annie through her hands up and sighed exasperatedly. This was not her day. She flopped down and sat on the grass. Charlie sat next to her."So then," Charlie began. "You met Fred and George?""Oh yeah.""What did you think of them?""Ummâ€¦Do they always-""-Finish each other's sentences? Yep, all the time."They both laughed."They knew who I was, you know.""Really?" Charlie said, sounding nervous."Yeah. They said that is was 'The girl Charlie knocked off her broomstick'."Annie and Charlie both burst out laughing, Charlie relaxing slightly."Yeah, the minute I got home, they asked Bill and Percy what my reaction was.""They asked me that too!""Oh, Merlin. Did you tell them?""Wellâ€¦To put it in their words, I said it was 'priceless'?" Annie said and the two laughed some more."Good summer?" Charlie asked."Yeah. Pretty boring, though. How about you?""Just stayed at home, really. Played Quidditch with my brothers, helped Dad with his Muggle collection.""Muggle collection?""Oh yeah. My Dad's obsessed with the way muggles live."Annie nodded and there was silence again."What's going on between you and Redmayne then?""Excuse me?""I was just wondering what was going on between you two.""We're dating.""Since when?""Well, since he asked me."Charlie snorted."What?" Annie asked, eyebrow raised in question"What do you see in him?" Charlie questioned."Ur, Excuse me?""No, it's just he seems a little closed minded, that's all. That, and he's a total prat."Annie looked at Charlie, appalled."What gives you the right to say that?!" She demanded."It's just my personal opinion." Charlie said, holding his hands up in defence."Yeah? Well next time, keep it to yourself."Charlie was about to reply when a shadow fell over them."My, are you the only two doing Care of Magical Creatures?" Professor Kettleburn asked. After shooting Charlie a glare, Annie nodded. Professor Kettleburn smiled widely."My two favourite students, as well! Well then, let's get started!"Annie got up and followed the Professor. Not before shooting Charlie another murderous glare. Any respect she had held for him was now gone, replaced with that burning hatred once more.Please review!

Last update of the weekend. Yay! More reviews! Keep them coming! Enjoy and review! Disclaimer - I own nothing but my OC'sThat is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong - .Fitzgerald25th December 1989"Annie! Annie, wake up!" Tonks voice echoed through Annie's head, waking her out of her dreams. "Annie, its Christmas!"Annie's eyes fluttered open. She sat up and saw Tonks sat on her bed, opening presents. They were the only two girls in the dormitory; all the other girls had gone home. Annie had only stayed because Tonks' parents had went away and Annie didn't want Tonks to spend Christmas alone. Although her father was upset, he understood why she had stayed. The restaurant was open Christmas day so at least he wouldn't be alone."Thanks for the Broom Servicing Kit! It's just what I wanted." Tonks said and she grinned."You're welcome." Annie said, before opening the top present on the pile at the foot of her bed. The first present was from Tonks, the label said. Annie ripped the wrapping paper off, revealing a first edition copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, as well as some chocolate Frogs."Oh my God, Tonks!" Annie exclaimed when she saw the book. "How did you even get this?"Tonks smiled widely and shrugged."My Mum knows people.""Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!""Okay, you like it!"From Chris, Annie got a long necklace with a sapphire charm, along with â€“ Annie smiled â€“ a box of chocolate cauldrons. From her paternal Grandparents, who lived in France, she received a warm kitted jumper, a silk scarf, and some chocolate. The last present â€“ from her father- was the largest. Annie opened it carefully. The first thing she came to was a large box. When she opened the lid, she saw a pair of leather ankle boots. What astonished Annie the most was the fact that they were nice. Especially since her Dad must have bought them. Smiling to herself, she opened the next present. It was a book - The Great Gatsby. Annie opened the book, turning to the first page. There was a message written on itMy Dear Annie,I'm sorry I can't be there for you while you grow up. I'm sorry I won't be there when you fetch your first boyfriend home, or to watch your father walk you down the aisle. I want you to know, I am sorry for leaving you. I wish we could have spent more time together. But I know that you will turn out to be a beautiful young girl. Your father will do an excellent job of raising you, no matter how hard it will be.The reason I wrote this note in this particular book is because this book contains something special. Like I have told you many times, life is like a pebble in the water. We can't dwell on past events, we can only look forward. This book summaries this. You can't recreate your past. Past events make you what you are.Please, don't dwell on my death. Don't let it hang over you like a black cloud. Enjoy life, live it to its full capacity. Go wild, get married, have some who loves you take care of you. And look after your father. He needs someone in his life. Don't let him work too hard. I'll always be watching over you.All my love, my beautiful daughter,Mum.Annie had tears in her eyes when she read this. Thank Merlin Tonks had left the room. Annie dried her eyes on a tissue and sighed. She then looked at the final piece of the present. There was a letter from her Dad, which she decided to read first.Merry Christmas, Annie!I hope Barney can carry all this, it didn't know how else to send it. Anyway, the restaurant is doing well, for this time of year. Lots of bookings for Christmas dinner, and me without my best waitress! I hope you and Tonks have a good Christmas, make sure she doesn't hurt herself too much!I didn't read the book. I knew your mother had put a note in there for you and I didn't want to intrude. I hope you like your shoes, they took me forever to pick out! The last part of your present â€“ which I know you won't have seen before you read this â€“ was, yet again, your mothers. She wanted you to have it when you were old enough, and I think you are now. It was her mother's â€“ your grandma â€“ and her mother's before that.I'll see you in July. Enjoy school and you tell me if Chris isn't treating you properly. I may be a muggle, but I'll teach him a lesson!Love, Dad.Annie put the letter down and looked for the last part of the present. It was in a medium size box, wrapped up colourfully. Because of its apparent age, Annie thought it would be best if she didn't shake it. Carefully, she untied the ribbon and opened the box. She gasped at what she saw. It was what looked to be a small metal birdcage, complete with two little birds inside. One was yellow, the other red. On the bottom of it, was a wind up key. It was a music box. Annie took the key and began to wind it. The sweet sound echoed through the room. It was her mother's favourite, Clair De Lune, by Claude Debussy.By the time Tonks walked back into the room, Annie was crying her eyes out.Please review!

Hey, my great readers. Your first update of the weekend. Please note, no update tomorrow, very busy wit work. Enjoy and review! P.S One of the longest chapters ever! Feel haapy!Maybe Christmas, the Grinch thought, doesn't come from a store - Dr Seuss25th December 1989"Are you sure you're ok?" Tonks asked, looking worried."Tonks, I'm fine." Annie reassured. Tonks gave her another worried glance and Annie sighed. "Look, Tonks. I know you're worried about me, but seriously, I'm fine." Tonks still looked a bit worried, by nodded."Ok then. But can talk to me about anything, you know."Annie smiled."I know. Now, race you to the Great Hall!" She exclaimed, running off. She could hear Tonks laughing and then her footsteps running after her.This was their first year stopping at school for Christmas so neither girl knew what to expect. When they got to the Hall, however, they were both slightly shocked. Instead of the four House tables and the staff table, there was one long table in the centre of the room, set for fifteen. Already, Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, Quirrell, and Kettleburn were sat round the table, as well as Filch and Madam Pomfrey."Merry Christmas!" Dumbledore cried when he saw the two girls walk in. "It seemed silly to have the House tables out when there are so few of us. In fact, after you two, only four others stayed back for the Holidays! Can you imagine? They should be joining us soon. Please, please, sit down!"Tonks and Annie sat in the seats they were closest to. Tonks next to Professor Flitwick, Annie next to an empty chair. Tonks picked up a cracker and offered it to Annie, who pulled it. With a loud bang, which was very much like a cannon fire, the cracker flew apart, scattering coloured tissue everywhere. Tonks picked up a pirate hat, while Annie picked up a cowboy hat. The two girls helped themselves to all the foods which were on the table, from turkey to roast potatoes.The girls had only been sat at the table for five minutes when the Great Hall doors swung open, and four boys walked in. Annie supressed a groan. She was getting sick of this. Charlie Weasley, in all his glory, mischievous smirk on his face, strutted up to the table, followed by his three brothers. When he saw the free seat next to Annie, his face lit up, and he made a beeline for it. He sat down in it, quickly looked at Annie, before pulling a cracker with Fred, who was sat on the other side of him. Annie spent most of dinner ignoring Charlie, mostly by talking to Tonks. That was, until, dinner ended and one of the twins began to speak after all the teachers had left."I know what we can do!" Fred â€“ Or was it George? â€“ exclaimed."What?" Tonks asked."Snowball fight!" The other twin proclaimed, his twin nodding his head furiously. Annie and Tonks exchanged looks. They had planned to go back to the Hufflepuff common room and play some wizards chess. Tonks looked like she wanted to go with the twins, while Annie had a stone look on her face. Going with the twins would mean that Charlie would be there, and she still hadn't forgave him from the things she said about Chris. However, Annie couldn't say no to Tonks' puppy dog face â€“ literally, her face changed to look like a puppy â€“ so reluctantly, she sighed."Alright then." Annie said. The twins beamed and Tonks jumped up."Let's go then!" She declared and the twins copied her."You have to come too, Percy!" Fred said to the quietest Weasley brother, whose nose was stuck in a book, oblivious to the world around him."What?" Percy asked, looking up from the book. Fred and George seized an arm each, and frog marched him out of the Hall. Annie and Tonks simply looked at each other, before grinning and running after them.The two girls caught up with the Weasley boys on the school grounds, just outside Hagrid's hut. The twins were already pelting each other with snowballs, while Charlie was talking to Percy. Tonks ran off towards the twins while Annie hung back."Come on, Annie!" Tonks shouted. "You're on my team!"Annie rolled her eyes, but smiled and ran towards Tonks."Okay then." Tonks said. "Annie, you're on my team. Fred and George are on a team together. That just leaves Charlie and Percy. Which team do you two want to be on?" She asked, looking from one to another."We want Charlie!" Fred exclaimed immediately."Yeah!" George agreed."But that's not fair!" Tonks whined."Tough." Charlie shrugged."Fine then." Tonks sighed. "Now that that's sorted, let's play!"Each person scrambled to their side, taking cover behind the large snow drifts that had formed."Right then." Tonks said. "We need a plan of attack. Annie, any ideas?"Annie thought about it for a minute."We need to mount a surprise attack. Sneak up on them.""Alright. Percy, any idea on how to do that?""We need to create a distraction while one of us attacks them from behind."Tonks and Annie nodded."Who should do that?" Tonks asked."I think Annie should do it." Percy said."What?" Annie exclaimed and Percy looked at her."They'll target me and Tonks but they'll forget about you when they see us." Percy stated."Yeah, he's right." Tonks realised. Annie sighed."Fine then. You too make a distraction then, and I'll sneak off.""Show no mercy!" Tonks added as Annie began to sneak away.Annie snuck behind Hagrid's hut, just as she heard Tonks and Percy jump out. Although she couldn't see them, she could tell that Tonks was leading the attack. Annie did feel slightly sorry for Percy, his brothers did seem to lead him into things he did not want to do.Annie peered round the side of Hagrid's hut. She could see the, taking shelter behind the snow drift. Every so often, they would jump up and throw a snowball, probably at Percy. Annie watched as Fred, then George stood up to throw snowballs. Hang on. One, two, where was the third? Where was Charlie? Annie looked around cautiously. She couldn't see any sign of Charlie, not even his footprints. However, it was snowing quite hardly and Annie could only see up to a certain distance. Perhaps Charlie had gone round the other side to mount a surprise attack on her team. Since there was no sign of this, Annie thought that was the most valid conclusion.Careful not to be seen, Annie crouched down and crawled across the snow, to the trees a little way behind the twins' shelter. She looked round the tree, so that only her head was visible, her body hidden by the tree. The twins couldn't see her and neither could Tonks or Percy. She was too far away from the latter.Annie crouch down, scooped up a handful of snow, and moulded it into a ball. So far, no one had been hit. If she managed to hit Fred or George, it would mean that the other would be easily taken down. Then she would only have to worry about Charlie. Annie raised her arm in to a throwing position, and just as she was about to throwâ€¦ THUMP!"Looks like we win." The unmistakable voice of Charlie Weasley said from behind.Please review!

Hey readers. Hope you all enjoyed the last chapter, it was really fun to write. I might update tomorrow, to mark my first year on and I also might update on Thursday, cos it's a very special day. Hope you like this chapter, it has a character from the series in it. Enjoy and review! Disclaimer - I own nothing but my OC'sFriendship... is not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything - Muhammad Ali16th June 1991"I can't believe this is the last day of school." Annie said."I know. Just think, in September I'll be starting Auror training while you start your Healing course." Tonks replied.The two girls were walking up to the Great Hall, where the End-of-Term Feast was taking place. They were walking slowly, reminiscing about their years in the school."Look!" Tonks said, pointing to a certain point on the Third floor. "This is the spot where Chris asked you out in fifth year!""I can't believe that was two years ago." Annie said, staring at the spot."Yeah. And to think, you two are moving in together soon!"Annie smiled. In the Easter Holidays, Chris had asked her if she would want to live with him after they left Hogwarts. Although she had said yes immediately, her father was a bit hesitant. However, after a bit persuasion and a promise of coming home to dinner twice a week, he agreed. Annie and Chris had found a little flat on Diagon Alley, above the Ice Cream parlour. The two could barely afford it, but somehow they managed."And over there-" Tonks said, dragging Annie over to another spot. "Was where a managed to jinx Charlie Weasley after he landed you in the Hospital Wing!""I can't remember that." Annie frowned and Tonks shrugged."Yeah, you were kind of unconscious at the time."Annie shook her head and simply laughed."Hey Annie!" Annie turned around and saw Cedric Diggory, a little Hufflepuff second year running towards her."Hi Cedric." Annie smiled."I just wanted to thank you for the tutoring in Transfiguration. I got the second highest mark in the year!""Aww, that's great Cedric! You're welcome. Now, I heard that you were thinking about trying out for the Quidditch team next year?" Annie asked."Yeah, as Seeker.""That's great. Good luck!"Cedric then went quiet."You know, I'm gonna miss you Annie. And you too, Tonks." He said."We'll miss you too, Cedric." Tonks said. "You're the only second year I don't half mind!""Tonks!" Annie cried. "You can't say things like that!""It's the truth." Tonks shrugged."Yes, but I's not that nice.""And that's why you're Head Girl." Tonks said, while Annie blushed. She looked down at the Head Girl that gleamed proudly on her robes."Come on you too." Annie said, taking Tonks and Cedric's arm. "We don't want to be late!"Together, the three of them ran to the Great Hall, laughing all the way. They took their seats at the Hufflepuff table, just as the last of the other students trickled in. Cedric said goodbye and ran off to sit with his second year friends. Annie sat in between Tonks and Adam, and watched as Dumbledore gave his end of term speech. Halfway through, she saw Chris trying to catch her eye. She looked towards the Ravenclaw table and smiled. Chris smiled back, his Head Boy badge shining in the light.The feast was very enjoyable. Annie talked to all of her housemates, even the first years. She swapped addresses with her fellow seventh years, as well as chatting to other seventh years from other houses â€“ well, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. The Slytherins kept to themselves. After the feast, Tonks headed back to the common room, while Annie stayed back to make sure that everyone stuck to their curfew. It was her last night as Head Girl and she wanted to do a good job."Hi, Annie." Chris said, walking over to her and kissing her."Hey, Chris." Annie smiled."I can't believe this is our last night here.""Yeah. Me and Tonks had the same conversation earlier.""I'm gonna miss it.""Me too."There was a moment of silence, until Chris said;"We should start patrols. Do you want to take the towers? Then you could just head back to your common room.""Ok. I'll see you tomorrow.""Bye." Chris said, as he kissed her. He then walked off in the direction of the Dungeon.Annie headed off up the Grand Staircase, towards the Astronomy Tower. Once she had walked up there, she walked round the other towers, starting at the Ravenclaw Tower, and ending at the Gryffindor Tower."No running!" She called to the two Weasley twins who had just ran past her. "I don't want to give you detention on the last day of term!""Aw, don't be such a spoil-sport, Ainsworth.""I wouldn't have to be if your brothers weren't so big a rule breakers." Annie replied and turned to face Charlie Weasley."They're not hurting anyone." He pointed out. Annie shrugged."Just doing my job." She replied."So then. Last round of the year?""Yeah. What are you doing?""Oh, you know. Just the last walk round the Castle. Do you want some company?" He asked.Annie thought about this for a minute. On one hand, there was her dislike for Charlie. On the other hand, there was the last chance to forgive him. And let's face it, Annie thought, it's not like I'm ever going to see him again."Alright then. You can walk with me."They walked round the halls and corridors, mostly in silence. Every so often, one of them would make a comment, the other would respond. Usually, it would be Charlie asking the questions."What are you doing next year?" Annie asked. Charlie stopped for a second and looked at her. "What?" Annie said."Nothing." He quickly replied. "I'm going to Romania, to study dragons. There's a reservation there. What are you doing?""Wow, that's impressive. Healer training. There's a course at St Mungo's, half theory, half practical. Professor Sprout said I could do my work experience here.""You get to come back?""Yeah. But it won't be for another few years, though.""It's cool though. You'll be here when my brother and sister are here.""Oh yeah. Ron, isn't it? I think I met him in first year.""Really?""Yeah, him and your Dad."They reached the Grand Staircase and Annie stopped."Well, here we are." She said."Here we are." Charlie repeated, smiling."So, I guess I'll see you around." Annie said, before walking off."Hey Annie?" Charlie said. Annie stopped and turned to face him."Yeah?""Ummâ€¦See you around." Charlie said. He looked like he was going to say more, but he didn't. Annie smiled and walked down the stairs.Please review!

Wahooo! A whole year on fanfiction! And to honour this, an update! Hope you enjoy, and thanks for the review! Keep them coming! Also, twenty chapters! Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.- Albert Camus12th September 1991"Annie! Annie, where are you?!" The easily recognisable voice of Tonks echoed through the flat."I'm in here, Tonks!" Annie called from the bedroom."I have the most amazing news!" Tonks cried.Tonks rushed through in to the bedroom, to see Annie standing in the centre, covered in paint stains, brush in hand."What happened here?" Tonks asked, wrinkling her nose."Oh, it's not that bad!" Annie replied."Annie, it looks like an explosion in a paint factory!" Tonks exclaimed, looking round the room. Each of the four walls were painted a different colour, and had splodges of other colours on them as well. Annie groaned and sat on the floor."This is hopeless!" She exclaimed. "I tried using the spell that paints surfaces but, oh I don't know!""Annie, calm down." Tonks said, sitting next to her. "I'll help you.""Really?""Yeah! What do you think friends are for?" Tonks smiled. "But, I do have one question though.""What?""If you were using magic, what's with all the paint tins and the brush?"Annie laughed."Oh well, you see. Dad gave me some paint, because he thought I would do it by hand. And when the spell failed, I tried to paint the walls by hand. But every time I put the paint on, it turned the wall a completely different colour!"Tonks laughed."Where did you get this spell from?" She asked."Here." Annie said handing Tonks a spell book which was opened on a page. "That one there." She said, pointing to the spell. Tonks quickly read the page, before she burst out laughing."What?" Annie asked, looking puzzled."Oh, Merlin, Annie! How can someone as smart as you be so thick?!" Tonks cried, still laughing."What do you mean?" Annie questioned."The reason why the spell didn't work, and the walls kept changing colour was because, well, you used the wrong spell!""What?""The spell you used was a spell to get rid of paint! No wonder the walls look like this!"Annie stared at the walls with a blank expression before bursting out in to laughter."Oh my God!" She cried, in between laughs. "I'm an idiot!"The two girls laughed for a bit longer, until finally, they could laugh no more. They both lay down on the floor and stared at the ceiling, recovering from the laughter."So what are you doing round here? What 'amazing news' do you have to tell me?" Annie asked, propping herself up on her elbow."What? Oh yeah! Annie you are not going to believe it!" Tonks cried, sitting up."I won't unless you tell me!" Annie laughed."Guess what! Guess what!""What?""Guess who I'm apprenticed under at the Ministry?""Who?""No, you have to guess!""Tonks! Ok, it Rufus Scrimgeour?""No!" Tonks cried. "He's the Head!""Then who is it?!""Mad Eye Moody!""Who's that?" Annie asked, confused. In response, Tonks took a shocked breath and turned to look at Annie."You don't know who Mad Eye Moody is?""Ur, muggle born?""He's only the most famous Dark Wizard catcher! He's helped to fill half of Azkaban, and ended up killing some of the biggest Death Eaters!""Lovely." Annie said sarcastically, as she got up."You don't understand. Out of all the Aurors in training, he chose me!" Tonks squealed, getting up as well."Well, then. This is cause for celebration." Annie said. "I think I have some wine in the fridgeâ€¦""No. You and me are going out. Get your jacket, we're going to the Leaky Cauldron.""Wait, hang on." Annie said."What?" Tonks said absentmindedly. Annie shook her head and pointed to the walls, which were still multi-coloured. "Oh, right."With a wave of her wand, the walls were one colour, dark blue."Come on!" Tonks said. "Let's go before all the Firewhiskey is gone!"Please review!

Hi readers! Now, this chapter was supposed to have been put up yesterday (because of a very special reason), but the WiFi was on the blink. My apologises so instead, you get two updates today! Yay! And another one sometime this weekend! Enjoy and review!Every year on your birthday, you get a chance to start new  - Sammy Hagar31st May 1994"I can't believe it! My little girl, all grown up!" William exclaimed. He and Annie were sat on the couch in the living room above the restaurant. It was Annie's birthday and they had just finished having lunch in celebration. Chris was invited, but he was busy at the Ministry. He was very sorry that he couldn't make it, but it wasn't the first time. In fact, it had been a long time since Chris had taken Annie out on a date."Daddy! I'm not your little girl anymore, I'm twenty one!" Annie replied."You'll always be my little girl, no matter how old you are."Annie smiled."Now then," William said. "What are you doing to celebrate?""Me and Tonks are going to see a muggle show, then we're going out.""That sound like fun. What are you going to see?""Grease. It's my favourite.""I know. God, I remember a six year old you opening the video box of it for Christmas. You spent all day singing along."They both laughed."I remember that Christmas. It was the first afterâ€¦" Annie trailed off. They were both silent."You'd best get going." William said quietly. "You don't want to be late for your big day!""Are you sure you're ok, Daddy?" Annie asked. William forced a smile."I'll be just fine, sweetheart. You have a good day.""Bye, Dad." Annie said as she stood up. She heard her father reply and she Apparated to her flat. She stood in the empty living room, blinking back tears."No," She said. "Mum wouldn't want you crying. Stay strong Annie."After that, Annie made sure she was distracted for the rest of the day. She made Chris's dinner and left it on the counter, cleaned the entire flat, completed all her coursework for Healer training, and then got ready for the night ahead. At four o'clock, Annie was ready. She was dressed in a red lace dress, dark red court shoes and a black blazer. Her hair was curled, and she had the slightest bit of make up on. Just as she had put enough muggle money in to her purse, there was a loud 'crack!' and Tonks' voice echoed through the apartment."Annie! Are you ready?""Two minutes, Tonks!" Annie called back. After a quick check in the mirror, Annie picked up her purse and walked out of her bedroom. Tonks was sat on the couch, flicking through the pages of one of Chris's ministry reports."Finally!" Tonks exclaimed when she saw Annie walk in."Oh, shut up. You're the one who usually takes forever to get ready," Annie replied."Hey! It takes time to look this good!" Tonks said, causing both girls to burst out laughing. "Anyway, here's you present." Tonks said, throwing a brightly wrapped present to Annie."Your Mum wrap this, did she?" Annie asked, giving the present a suspicious look."Annie! I am capable of wrapping up presents myself!" Tonks said, pretending to be upset."Oh really?" Annie raised an eyebrow. "Merlin, Tonks!" She cried. "How much spellotape did you use?""I thought it needed a lot!" Tonks exclaimed, and then she looked at her watch. "Forget about the present, we have to go now!"Tonks sprang up, grabbed Annie's wrist and ran for the door, causing Annie to drop her present on the way."That was great!" Tonks exclaimed as she and Annie sat down by a table in the Leaky Cauldron. "Why is this the first time I've ever heard of Grease?""Tonks, I've talked about it loads. I'm sure I spent Easter of fourth year just talking about it!" Annie replied."Really? I can't remember that.""You were planning to prank the Slytherin Quidditch team because they beat us in the match," Annie reminded Tonks."Oh yeah. They're faces were priceless though," Tonks reminisced."Yeah, totally worth the weeks' worth of detentions you got," Annie said."Yeah," Tonks said, happy look on her face.The girls ordered their drinks and chatted some more."Hey Annie?" Tonks said. "Where do you see yourself in five years' time?""Oh, ummâ€¦." Annie said, deep in thought. "Well, I know I'll be a fully qualified healer, but after that, I don't know. I think I'd want to travel. What about you?""A fully qualified Auror. And hopefully, I'll be married kids." Tonks replied. "Don't you want to have a family?""Yeah, yeah definitely. How many kids would you want?""Two. A boy and a girl. I'd want to name the boy after Dad, but I'm not sure for the girl's name. How about you?""I want a lot of kids. Just so they wouldn't be lonely. I've got no idea for names."Tonks laughed."What?" Annie asked, puzzled."Oh, Annie. My simple minded Annie. Do you have any idea what family that sounds like?""Which family?""The Weasleys!" Tonks exclaimed. Annie felt herself go red."No, no!""Yeah, Annie! Imagine you, married to Charlie Weasley!""No way. I will never marry Charlie Weasley. I've I was to ever marry a Weasley, it would be Bill.""Annie, every girl in our year wanted to marry Bill."Annie groaned."How are things with Chris?" Tonks asked."Oh fine, you know. I mean, he's been really busy with work, but he's really sorry about that. In fact, were going on a date soon." Annie said quickly."Really? I never see him, he must be really busy. I hardly ever see him round the Ministry.""Yeah, yeah he is," Annie said. She quickly finished her drink. "Look tonight was great but I have work in the morning so I'd better go.""Course. See you soon, Annie," Tonks said. Annie smiled."See you soon Tonks."Please review!

Hi readers. Second update today. Thank you for the reviews! Yes, Charlie will be back soon so keep reading! Enjoy and review!Since I'm always working, my best holiday memories are definitely when I can just go home and spend time with my family - Chris Brown24th August 1994"Are you sure you'll be alright?" Annie asked Chris. They were sitting on the settee, drinking tea. Annie was waiting for Tonks to pick her up, they were going to the Quidditch World Cup which was being held in England. Tonks had been able to get tickets because of her position in the Ministry. Straight away, she had asked Annie to go, and although she was hesitant, she agreed. Chris had not wanted to go, he was busy with work and was not the biggest Quidditch fan."I'll be fine. I can look after myself, you know." Chris said. "Don't you worry about me, just have a good time.""Ok. Now, I've put some meals for you in the fridge, you'll just have to warm them up-""Annie." Chris cut in. "Calm down. I'll be fine."He then kissed her forehead and Annie smiled."I know you will be." She said.They both leaned forward and kissed each other on the lips. There was then a large crack."I don't mean to interrupt this whole lovey dovey moment but we really have to be going soon." Tonks said, ruining the moment. Annie and Chris parted and Annie sighed."You're late." Annie said."No I'm not. You were just ready early." Tonks stated. "Wotcher Chris.""Hi Tonks. You all ready?""You bet. I've got the tent, all the food, and money for little souvenirs and stuff. I've got to get something for Dad too." Tonks replied."And I've got the muggle money for the campsite since you have no idea what is what." Annie said to Tonks, picking up her rucksack. Tonks held her hands up in defence."It's not my fault I was raised by wizards.""Your Dad's muggle born!""So? He's a slob too but I don't copy that.""Wellâ€¦""Oi, watch it you!" Tonks said."Come on then, let's go." Annie laughed. She turned to Chris. "I'll see you in a few days then."Chris smiled."Have a good time. And enjoy yourself! Don't think of me when you're there, you'll only worry.""Fine. Love you.""Love you too. Bye."Tonks grabbed hold of Annie's hand they apperated. They appeared in the valley of a murky looking moor, the fog hung close to the ground."Wotcher Basil," Tonks said to a man who was holding a long piece of parchment and a quill. He was looking rather tired and looked as though he was trying to be muggles in his mismatched clothing. "Long night?""Hello Tonks. Yeah, there's been loads coming in. Party from Mould-on-the-Wold came in a few hours ago. About nine of them? And after that, big party came in not five minutes after. It's been a long night.""Aw, well, it'll be worth it. Who's your money on?" Tonks asked."Bulgaria. They've got Krum so they've got the best odds. Where about are you sitting?""Top Box. Mad Eye fixed me and Annie up with tickets.""Good, good. Under your name is it?" Basil asked, looking at the list. "Field under Mr Roberts, 'bout a quarter mile's walk. First field you come too.""Thanks Basil. Have a good night!" Tonks called as she and Annie walked away. They heard Basil mutter something but they couldn't make out what he said.After about five minutes' walk, the two girls came to a cottage where a man was standing. Another man, who was clearly a wizard hovered nearby. Annie quickly gave him the correct money, she thought that the man was beginning to suspect something. Maybe that was why the wizard was keeping a close watch on him."You're up by the woods." The site manager, Mr Roberts, said snapping Annie out of her thoughts. "And here's a map of the site, it show where the water tap is. I think that's everything.""Thank you." Annie smiled, taking the map."Enjoy your stay." Mr Roberts said.The two girls walked off in the direction of the forest. Around them were hundreds of tents, some trying to blend in like Muggles, others didn't. Some tents had turrets, some had chimneys, and one tent looked over three floors tall. Just before they end of the field, there was a crooked sign that said 'Tonks'."Come on then." Tonks said. "Help me put this tent up then."Please review!

I'm back! Here is the first part of the Quidditch World Cup! There'll be some characters you recognise in this chapter too. Also, the events of the Quidditch World Cup will span over quite a few chapters, which ic good news for you. Enjoy and please review!Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day - Dalai Lama25th August 1994 - 5:00 amAnnie woke up to the sound of chatter from outside the tent. Rolling over, she saw it was around five o'clock in the morning. Knowing she would not get much sleep from this point, she groaned and got out of bed. The cold morning air pinched at her exposed skin, as she was only wearing her nightie and a pair of socks. Annie walked into the kitchen and made herself a cup of tea. She knew that she should be using a fire to heat the water but she didn't want to mess around with making one. Maybe in a few hours when Tonks was up and they would have breakfast.She settled down on a chair by the table and summoned the book she was meant to read for her Healer course. Although she had managed to get time off, she still had homework to do. Sipping her tea, she curled up and began to read."Annie. Annie wake up!" Tonks voice brought Annie out of her daze. Her eyes opened and she saw Tonks standing over her, full dressed."Hey Tonks. You're up early." Annie said."Early? Annie, it's half eleven." Tonks stated."What? No, it's about fiveish, Tonks." Annie yawned."Annie, look at the clock." Tonks said. Annie looked over at the wall clock and like Tonks said, it was half eleven."Oh, damn! I was gonna read my book for my course." Annie complained, annoyed at herself for nodding off."Well, you must have been tired. Now, quit your whining. Get dressed, so we can have lunch." Tonks said, picking up the mug of cold tea. Annie sighed and walked into her room in the tent. She quickly brushed her teeth, and washed her face. Annie then pulled out a light blue plaid shirt, white vest top, and a pair of cropped jeans. She slipped on her brown ballet flats and walked out to meet Tonks."About time!" Tonks joked and Annie rolled her eyes."Oh, shut up you." Annie said. "I think we have neighbours, I heard a load of people go past when I woke up.""Hmm. Let's go make sure they've set up alright." Tonks said.The two girls walked out of the tent. Nothing could have prepared Annie for what she saw next though. Two tents around a fire pit. Normal enough. Middle aged man trying to light the fire. Still normal. Middle aged man with red hair, as well as four children with red hair sat around the fire. Two of them were twins with red hair who Annie recognised. Yep, Annie's new neighbours were the Weasleys. Thankfully, Charlie Weasley was nowhere in sight. As well as Mr Weasley and the four Weasley children, there was a boy with black hair and glasses and a girl with bushy brown hair."Annie!" One of the twins- probably Fred â€“ exclaimed."It's Annie!" The other twin, George said. Mr Weasley, how was trying to light a fire with matches looked up."Hmm?""Dad, its Annie." Fred said."Annie? Annie who?" Mr Weasley asked."Annie Ainsworth, Dad. Don't tell me you've forgotten." George said."Of course I haven't. Annie, it's good to see you." Mr Weasley said, getting up and shaking Annie's hand."It's good to see you too, Mr Weasley." Annie replied. "You know Tonks, don't you?""Yes, yes, of course. Ted's daughter." Mr Weasley said. As he moved to talk to Tonks, Annie walked over to the Twins."Well, you too have definitely grown." Annie said to them. "I remember when you too were scrawny little first years that came up to here." Annie held up a hand to indicate the height. "Now look at you! Really tall sixth years. I mean really tall. Like really. Stop growing!" Annie said. The twins towered over her 5 foot five height. The twins just laughed."Yep, looks like were the one giving the orders round here now." Fred said."We are the tallest now." George added.From behind the Twins, someone cleared their throat. The twins parted, revealing the other two Weasleys and the boy with glasses and the bushy haired girl."And you." Annie said, walking up to Ron. "I remember when you were four years old and barely reached my knee.""It's good to see you again, Annie." Ron grinned."And, I'm sorry but I don't know the rest of you." Annie apologised as she turned to face the other three. "But, I think you're Ginny. Am I right?"The ginger girl smiled."Yeah, I'm Ginny. That's Hermione Granger and Harry Potter." Ginny said, pointing to each person in turn."Nice to meet you." Annie smiled."Hey Annie!" Tonks called. "Mr Weasley would like us to stay for lunch!""That's very kind of you, Mr Weasley. Thank you." Annie said."No problem you too." Mr Weasley replied. "We have a lot of catching up to do."Please review!

Hi readers! Yet another update! But, aww, no more reviews. But on the bright side, more favs and follows! And over 4000 views! Did you like the last chapter? The Weasleys are back! And in this chapter, so is Charlie! So please, read and review!Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names - John. F. Kennedy25th August 1994 Part 2 â€“ Around 1:00pmIt took Mr Weasley another ten minutes to light the fire, and another hour after that till it was hot enough to cook anything."So, I know Tonks is training to be an Auror, but what are you doing now Annie?" Mr Weasley asked."I'm training to be a Healer, Mr Weasley." Annie replied."Really?!" Hermione asked from across the fire. "How did you do in your O.W.L's?""Oh, you know alright.""Ha!" Tonks exclaimed. "She got four O's and only failed History of Magic.""Tonksâ€¦" Annie muttered, going red."Well done, Annie. You too," Mr Weasley said to the twins. "Could do with taking a leaf out of Annie's books."The twins muttered something but Annie couldn't hear it."Right then." Mr Weasley said. "Let's get these sausages cooked."Mr Weasley bustled off to get the sausages."OH!" Tonks exclaimed. "It's Ryan!""Who?" Annie asked, looking round."Ryan! I work with him at the Ministry. Be back in a minute." Tonks said before running off. Annie sighed."You're the one Charlie knocked off their broom, aren't you?" Ginny asked and Annie laughed."Is that all I'm known for? But yeah, that was me." Annie smiled."How far did you fall?" Hermione asked."Tonks says about 50 feet.""Hey, that's around about how far Harry fell last year." Fred said."You know," George said. "She never gave us a detention when we were in Hogwarts.""Really?" Ginny asked."Never." Fred replied."She has a name, you know." Annie interrupted."Yeah, but she is just a better name for you!"Soon, the sausages were cooked and Mr Weasley passed them round. Tonks reappeared as well, grinning like a maniac."Just Apparated, Dad." The loud voice of Percy Weasley filled the air. "Ah, excellent, lunch!"Percy sat down in the seat next to Tonks. When he saw Tonks and Annie, he nearly did a double take."Tonks? Annie? Good to see you again!""Wotcher Percy.""Hey Percy." Annie said."Annie! I can't remember the last time I saw you. How are you doing?" Percy asked. Annie was about to reply when;"Annie?" Annie turned around and was shocked at the sight which met her.There, in front of her, was Charlie Weasley. But not the Charlie Weasley she knew. Charlie Weasley looked, well, hot. Even back in school he was one of the most handsome students but Charlie had really grown up over the three years Annie hadn't seen him. He was taller, but not by that much. He had the same short and stocky build as the twins. His hair was longer, his skin was tanned and he seemed more muscular. His arms were covered burns and blisters and he seemed to have gotten even more freckled."Hey, Charlie." Annie said. "Hey Bill." She added when she saw Bill appear behind Charlie."Hi Annie. Hi Tonks." Bill grinned."Oh, yeah, Um, Hi Tonks." Charlie quickly added. His face had gone slightly red, but it was difficult to tell under all the freckles."Wotcher Charlie." Tonks grinned, looking from him to Annie.The last two Weasleys quickly sat down, and they all continued to eat their lunch. Mr Weasley, unknowingly, distracted them but pointing out various Ministry officials."That's Arnold Peasegood â€“ He's an Obliviator-""So, Annie." Charlie said, moving to sit next to her. "How you doing?""Oh, fine, you know.""What have you been doing?""Still in Healer training. I have my work experience coming up.""Oh. Where are you doing it at?""I'm not sure just yet. I still have to sort something out.""What? Annie Ainsworth leaving something to the last minute?""Shove off. So, what are you doing?""Studying Dragons in Romania.""Wow. That's good. Do you enjoy it?""Yeah. Yeah, it's really interesting."The two sat there in an awkward silence."Annie!" Tonks shouted. "Come on, we have to go!""Ok, Tonks!" Annie shouted back. She turned to face Charlie. "So, I guess I'll see you around.""Yeah. Bye Annie." Charlie replied. Annie smiled and left.Please review!

I'm back readers! I hope you enjoy this chapter, it's Charlie's point of view. After this long, it'll be nice to hear what he has to say. Anyway, thank you for the review and the favs and follows! Everything is very appreciated! Enjoy and please review!The course of true love never did run smooth - William Shakespeare25th August 1994 Part Three â€“ 2:35pm"How you doing?' That's all you asked her?" Bill asked Charlie disbelievingly."What else was I supposed to say? All you lot were there! What else could I say?" Charlie said, throwing his rucksack on the bottom bunk. He, Bill and their father would share a room while the Twins, Ron and Harry shared the other room. Hermione and Ginny were in the smaller tent."I don't know! I'm just saying, first you went bright red, then you asked her silly questions! You knew she was doing a Healer's course, that's all you talked about at one point.""Urgh, I know. I'm hopeless." Charlie said. He flopped down onto the bed, and rested his head in his hands. "What am I supposed to say? Every time I see her, I go red and completely blank!""Well, then." Bill said, sitting next to him. "We'll just have to fix that. Now come on, we're meeting them before we go."Charlie nodded and followed him out of the tent. They were just waiting for Annie, Tonks, Ginny and Hermione, the latter had went to get ready in Annie and Tonks' tent. Hermione and Ginny came out first and they headed towards Harry and Ron. Tonks then came out, hair a bright green colour for the occasion."Hurry up, Annie!" She shouted. "Everyone is waiting!""I can't find my bag!" Annie's voice called back."I've got it!""Why do you have it?" Annie asked walking out of the tent."Because, I knew you'd lose it." Tonks shrugged.Annie rolled her eyes and turned to look at Charlie. Charlie gasped, he couldn't help it. In his opinion, Annie looked great. She was wearing a pretty white shirt, olive coloured jeans, a green scarf and her beige military boots. Her curly blonde hair had been plaited into a messy side plait and she was wearing the smallest amount of makeup, which amplified the brownness of her eyes.Annie's gaze shifted from Charlie, whose mouth was slightly open, to Tonks, who was stood holding Annie's bag, and looking between Annie and Tonks. Annie reached forward and took the bag from Tonks, slinging it over her shoulder."We ready to go then?" Annie asked."Yeah, yeah," Charlie replied quickly. "We're just waiting for Dad."Annie nodded and began to talk to Ginny and Hermione, the two girls just having walked over."I know, you know," A voice said from behind Charlie. He turned round and saw Tonks standing there, knowing look in her eyes."Know what?" Charlie asked quickly. Tonks grinned."That you like Annie.""What? No I don't," Charlie quickly stuttered. Tonks just looked at him."Yes you do. Half of Hogwarts knew, Charlie. I think the only person who doesn't know is Annie herself.""Is it really that obvious?" Charlie sighed, running a hand through his hair."Yeah. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone," Tonks said before walking off to join Annie's conversation."Men are doomed," Charlie muttered to himself.Soon, Mr Weasley was ready and they began to walk towards the stadium. All around them, the crowds bustled, excited for the match. Stall holders shouted their various merchandise from behind their overflowing trollies. It wasn't long before all the younger members of the group disappeared into the crowds of salesman, no doubt spending their savings."Look Annie!" Tonks cried, pointing to a specific stall. "Rosettes!"Tonks grabbed Annie's arm, dragging her over to the stall, leaving Charlie with Bill."Tonks know," Charlie said quietly."Charlie, everybody knows except Annie. Why don't you tell her?" Bill asked."Because, Bill, she hates me," Charlie stated. Bill shook his head."No, Charlie. She didn't particularly like you in school. I'm sure if you just talked to her, you might realise that she doesn't hate you anymore.""But why? She's got a boyfriend.""And from what I've heard, not a very good one. Dad's mention him a few times and from what I gather, he's just like Percy but worse."Charlie stopped and turn to face Bill directly."Do you really think I have a chance with her?" He asked. Bill smiled."Definitely. Now go get her."Please review!

5000 views! Yay! This is great! So then, you saw Charlie's feelings in the last chapter but now it's back to Annie. But don't worry! He'll be back soon. Anyway, 5000 views and counting! That's great! I honestly didn't think it would be this popular. I'm thinking about writing a Once upon a Time fanfiction. Comments? Also, please tell me if Annie seems to Mary Sue, or the other characters seem to OOC. Please enjoy and review!I love it when someone insults me. That means that I don't have to be nice anymore. - Billy Idol25th August 1994 Part Four â€“ 4:05 pm"What do you think?" Annie said, holding up a green rosette. "Is it me?""Hmmmâ€¦.I think you suit red more," Tonks replied, holding a Bulgarian red rosette up next to Annie. "Yep, definitely red."Annie laughed."Yeah, well, I'm going with the green. Ireland all the way.""Why? You know Krum will get the snitch," Tonks replied."Yeah, but Ireland's got way better players. Bulgaria's only got the one. And anyway, I have to support Ireland, my Mum was half Irish.""Pffttâ€¦Have you even been to Ireland before?""Yeah, once when I was really little."Tonks laughed."Come on, Irish, we don't want to miss the match!" Tonks exclaimed and pulled Annie over towards the Weasley family. Most of them were wearing green rosettes, like Annie. Charlie, however, wasn't. When Tonks went over to speak with the twins, Annie walked over to Charlie."And where's your rosette?" She asked. Charlie looked at her."Didn't want one," He replied."Oh now come on, Mr Spoil Sport, get in to the mood. At these things, you have to wear your team's colour, especially the merchandise.""Who says?""Me. Now, if you're not going to buy yourself a rosette, I will.""No, you don't have to do that.""Yes, I do," Annie insisted. "What type of fan would I be if I ignored someone who wasn't wearing the team's colours?"Annie marched over to a stall, leaving a protesting Charlie. After a few minutes, she returned, holding a green rosette."There," She said, fixing it in place. "Much better."The two smiled. And then, there was that awkward silence between the two. What do I do? Annie thought to herself. Do I talk to him? What should I talk about? Oh, damn your shyness, Annie. Luckily, the silence didn't last long because soon, the party began to walk up the stairs to their seats. Mr Weasley was talking to the younger ones, while Charlie had quickly begun to talk the Bill, leaving Annie with Tonks."So, where about are we sitting?" Annie asked."Top Box," Tonks replied, looking up the stairs."You got seats for the Top Box?" Annie exclaimed, disbelievingly."No, Mad Eye got us Top Box seats. So remember to thank him the next to you see him."Annie nodded. It wasn't long before the two reached the Top Box, along with the Weasleys. Few people were already sat there, dotted around the box. One of them was a House-Elf. Annie saw Harry go over to speak to it, and he was closely followed by Ron and Hermione.Tonks quickly bustled Annie in to a seat and quickly took the seat next to her, leaving a spare seat on the other side of Annie."Tonks? What are you-" Annie spluttered as she fell into her seat. "Tonks! You- Wowâ€¦" Annie breathed as when she saw the view. She stared out over the arena, her eyes drinking in everything."Annie!" Tonks' voice snapped Annie out of her thoughts."What?" Annie said, slightly dazed."You were saying?""What? Oh yeah, Tonks! What were you do-""Charlie!" Bill exclaimed from behind Annie. "Why don't you sit here?" Bill said, pushing Charlie into the spare seat next to Annie."Hey, Bill! Why don't we go get some programmes?" Tonks said."Great idea, Tonks!" Bill grinned. "Come on, let's go!"The two dashed away, leaving Annie and Charlie in silence. Both were bright red, mostly from embarrassment."I say," A snobbish voice said from behind them. "Look at the filth they're letting sit up here. A Weasley and a Mudblood.""Flint," Charlie growled through barred teeth. "What do you want?""Now, now, Weasley, play nice. How did you afford to even step in to the Top Box? Had to sell that pig sty your family call a house?""Shut it, Flint," Charlie snarled. Flint just laughed."Ha! How are you doing Ainsworth? Not retreated back into the Muggle world?""Flint. See your brain's still the size of a pin head then?""Ouch, that hurt. Finally agreed to go out with Weasley? I didn't think you were that desperate.""Don't be such an arse, Flint," Annie glared at him. Flint's eyes went dark."Watch it, Mudblood," Flint threatened."Don't you dare call her that," Charlie hissed, his voice dark."Or what?" Flint challenged. Charlie rose slowly, so that he and Flint were head to head. There was a dangerous glint in Charlie's eye. Annie too stood up, her gaze switching between the two."Is there a problem here?" A voice said from behind. Everyone turned to look.Tonks stood in the front, closely followed by Bill, Mr Weasley, and the rest of the Weasleys. Knowing he was beaten, Flint sent one last glare at Annie and Charlie, before stalking off. Mr Weasley bustled round, making sure everyone got to their seats, and trying to distract them from what had happened."Thanks," Annie whispered to Charlie while everyone else was chatting. Charlie looked down at her, slightly conflicted look on his face."It's fine," He replied. "I couldn't let him speak to you like that."Annie was about to reply when a voice boomed through the arena, welcoming them all to the match. Everyone quietened down, but there was still an occasional cheer."Allow me to introduce," Ludo Bagman announced. "The Bulgarian Team mascots!"A hundred tall, willowy women with white gold hair and shinning pale skin walked on to the pitch. Veela, Annie thought. The Veela started to dance, causing all the men in the stadium â€“ with the exception of Mr Weasley and any other man who had the common sense to cover their ears â€“ to act strangely, blank, in love expressions on their faces. Next to Annie, Charlie had his hands on the railing, looking ready to jump, dazed expression on his face. When the Veela stopped dancing, he was still frozen in that position. Sighing slightly, Annie put her hand on Charlie's shoulder and pulled him back. Almost immediately, his expression changed from dazed to confused."Thanks," He muttered, going slightly red."No problem," Annie replied quietly.Annie felt strange, almost jealous. Why should I be jealous? She asked herself. I don't like Charlie, not in that way. I have Chris, I'm happy. Sighing, she returned to watching the match. But, in the back of her head, there was still that question. Could I be falling for Charlie Weasley?Please review!

Well, the World Cup is drawing to an end. And what happened at the end? The riot! Which is this chapter! I hope you enjoy it, it's one of the longer chapters. Also, I want to thank IKhandoZatman. This person is great! They've already reviewed four times! So thank you very much! Please read and review!You can chain me, you can torture me, you can even destroy this body, but you will never imprison my mind- Mahatma Gandhi 25th August 1994 Part 5 â€“ 11:00pm (ish)"Ireland! Ireland!" Tonks shouted all the way back to the tent."I thought you supported Bulgaria?" Annie laughed as they weaved through the crowd. The Weasleys closely followed, staying as one big group."Yeah, but you have to chant the winning team's name. It's, like, the rule," Tonks replied."I have never heard that before. Are you sure you're not making it up?" Annie asked, bumping into other happy spectators. Tonks stopped and turned to face Annie."Have you ever been to a Quidditch match with my Dad? If you had, you'd understand," Tonks said, and Annie just laughed.The group soon made it back to the tent, where Mr Weasley invited the two girls in for hot chocolate. They accepted, and sat in the crowded living room, sipping hot chocolate. Everyone was chatting happily, still buzzed from the excitement of the match. After what had happen back in the arena and the strange thoughts in her head, Annie had been avoiding Charlie. Mostly because of her confusing thoughts. Once everyone had finished their drinks, Annie and Tonks headed back to their tent.Annie bided good night to Tonks and headed to her room. When there, she quickly changed into her nightie and bed socks, throwing her clothes onto her backpack. She lay on her bed, curling up in the blankets. Slowly, her eyelids got heavier and she drifted off into sleep."Annie," A voice said. Someone was shaking her. "Annie, wake up!"Groggily, Annie's eyes fluttered open. Tonks stood over her, shaking her awake. She still wearing her night clothes, her usual leather jacket thrown over her shoulders. It was still dark in the tent, with the exception of the light Tonks had produced from her wand. This told Annie she had not been asleep for long."Quickly Annie! Grab your jacket, we have to go help!" Tonks exclaimed.Slightly half asleep and dazed, Annie pulled on her shoes and grabbed her jacket and her wand. Even though she was not fully awake, she could hear screams outside and knew something was wrong. She moved quickly, willing herself to wake up. When she ran out of the tent, two steps behind Tonks, she gasped.It was chaos. Everywhere, people were running and screaming. Tents were on fire and were being trampled over in the mad dash to escape. Loud noises and drunken cheers were coming from a group of people, masked and marching through the field. What really shocked Annie was the four figures that hovered above their heads. It was Mr Roberts, the site manager, and what looked to be his wife and children.Out of the corner of her eye, Annie saw most of the Weasleys and Harry dash out of their tent. Hermione and Ginny quickly appeared beside them. Only the older ones were fully dressed, making Annie feel slightly embarrassed by her appearance."Where going to help the Ministry!" Annie heard Mr Weasley shout over the noise. She heard him shout something else to the younger ones, and he, Bill, Charlie and Percy sprinted towards the masked crowd."Come on!" Tonks exclaimed, grabbing Annie's arm. The two tore after the elder Weasleys, wands raised.As they neared the crowd, the two girls immediately began to send spells and hexes towards the crowd. They fell in place by the Weasleys, Annie in between Tonks and Charlie, though they were scattered around the crowd."Stupefy!" Annie cried, sending a stunning spell towards a masked figure, who crumpled to the ground.As she and her fellows fought harder, the crowd of masked figures seemed to grow ever bigger. Annie sent every jinx, hex and curse she could think of at the crowd. Slowly, their numbers seemed to thin."Flipendo!" Annie shouted, causing a masked man to be knocked back. "Reducto!"Annie saw the masked man next to the fallen one growl and glare at her."Filthy Mudblood!" He snarled. "Crucio!"Pain flooded through every part of Annie's body. It was the worst pain she had ever felt, like every inch of her skin was being stabbed repeatedly. She fell to the floor, screaming."Annie!" She vaguely heard someone cry. She couldn't pinpoint who, the pain was too intense. "Pertrificus Totalus!" The voice exclaimed and the pain stopped. "Annie, are you ok?" The same voice asked, worried. Annie, slightly disoriented, sat up. Charlie was crouched next to her, his hand on her shoulder."I'm fine," Annie mumbled. "Just a little wobbly, that's all."Looking slightly unconvinced, Charlie stood up, helping Annie up. Charlie seemed mostly unharmed, with the exception of the large rip in his shirt."No, you're hurt. You're bleeding," Charlie told her. Annie held a hand up to her head and when she saw it, she could see the blood staining her hand. There was also a large cut on her arm."We have to get you out of here," Charlie said."No. We have to stay and help people. I'm fine Charlie," Annie insisted. Charlie look like he was about to protest when a scream rang out."It's the Dark Mark!"Both Annie's and Charlie heads whipped round and, sure enough, there was the Dark Mark, floating over the treetops. Around them, terrified screams rang out and the men in masks began to Disapparate."We have to get out of here," Charlie stated. Arms round Annie's shoulders, he guided her through the mass of partly destroyed tents, towards where others were congregated. Among the group was Bill, Tonks and Percy."Annie!" Tonks cried, seeing her dishevelled appearance. "Are you ok?""I'm fine, Tonks," Annie reassured her. "Just a bit wobbly."Tonks looked from Annie, in her messy state, to Charlie, who was still supporting Annie."Whatever you did," Tonks began. Everyone present began to cringe slightly, waiting for the explosion. "Thank you. You saved Annie."Charlie, slightly dumbfounded, could only smile slight and nod."Annie!" A new voice exclaimed, coming from the crowd of Ministry officials. Annie recognised the voice."Chris!" She cried, and hobbled out of Charlie's grip, towards her boyfriend, who hugged her."Annie," Chris said quietly. "You're alright.""Never better," Annie smiled, burying her head in his shoulder.Please review!

I'm back! Whoo! More reviews! Thank you! And to answer IKhandoZatman's question, yes, Annie will be in the Trizward Tournament, but you'll have to wait for more on that! Anyway, thanks for the reviews, keep them coming!Envy is the art of counting the other fellow's blessings instead of your own- Harold Coffin25th August 1994-11:45 (ish)Charlie sent any and every spell he could think of at the Death Eaters. How could they torture those innocent muggles like that? Two of them were children! For Merlin's sake. Bill and Percy had disappeared, fighting the Death Eaters. Tonks and his father had also vanished, leaving Charlie duelling next to Annie. He was impressed, to say the least. He never thought someone like Annie would be capable of holding their own against Death Eaters, who were twice her size and had way more experience than her.That was, until, he heard the curse. The Cruciatus Curse. And Annie, Annie the girl who he was desperately in love with after all these years, fell to the ground, screaming in pain.Indescribable fury flooded through Charlie. How dare that Death Eater hurt his Annie? He knew he would never have a chance with Annie, but that didn't stop him from loving her."Pertrificus Totalus!" He exclaimed, binding the man in invisible ropes. Annie stopped screaming, but was still shaking slightly."Annie, are you ok?" Charlie said the same words he had said all those years ago, the last time Annie's tough demur had been broken, showing a weakened girl. At first, Annie did not reply, she just shook slightly. Then, slowly, she sat up. Charlie's hand immediately went to her shoulder, to support her."I'm fine," Annie mumbled. "Just a little wobbly, that's all."Charlie, however, did not believe her. It was obvious she was in pain, considering what she had just been through."No, you're hurt. You're bleeding," Charlie told her. Charlie watched as Annie held a hand to her head, and the blood drip on to it."We have to get you out of here," Charlie said. He quickly glanced round, to check for any dangers."No. We have to stay and help people." Annie began to protest. "I'm fine Charlie."Charlie was about to protest against this. She clearly wasn't alright. Tonks would kill Charlie if he let her stay in this state. And Charlie was worried about Annie. The cut on her arm could get infected or â€“ The scream broke Charlie out of his thoughts."It's the Dark Mark!"Charlie's head whipped round. He noted how Annie did the same, and how her body seemed to tense. The Dark Mark hovered above the treetops, giving off an eerie green glow. Charlie had only seen pictures of it, never in person. He could hardly remember the Wizarding War, he was too young and his Mother kept him and his brothers under a tight leash. He could vaguely remember his uncles, Gideon and Fabian, from when he was really little. That is, before they were killed by Death Eaters. This was partly what fuelled his hatred towards the Death Eaters. That, and one of them had just hurt the girl he had been secretly in love with for the past ten years."We have to get out of here," Charlie said as the Death Eaters quickly fled from the sign of their master. His arms went round Annie's shoulders, steading her as she got up. He led her through the partly destroyed field, towards where he saw his brothers and Tonks stand."Annie!" Tonks cried when she saw them. Her eyes looked over her dishevelled appearance, towards Charlie. Breaking away from Tonks' questioning glance, Charlie quickly and discretely looked down at Annie. Her clothes were slightly torn, her arms and face had cuts on, and her blonde hair was a mess, sticking to her face from the blood."I'm fine, Tonks," Annie reassured her. "Just a bit wobbly."Tonks looked from Annie, in her messy state, to Charlie, who was still supporting Annie. And he wasn't letting go anytime soon."Whatever you did," Tonks began. Everyone present began to cringe slightly, waiting for her reaction. Charlie began to stiffen, nervous for Tonks' next action. "Thank you. You saved Annie."This was not the reaction Charlie was expecting. He was expecting her to react like she had in fifth year, when he had taken Annie to the Hospital Wing. Threatening to hex him. In fact, he was so shocked, all he could do was nod numbly."Annie!" A slightly familiar voice called. No, Charlie thought. Not now, I'm so close. Through the crowd, pushed the unmistakable figure of Chris Redmayne, Annie's boyfriend. Grinning, Annie wriggled out of Charlie's grip and ran towards her boyfriend's outstretched hands. As he watched the one girl he had ever loved run into the arms of another, Charlie realised that it didn't matter how hard he tried. She would never be his.Please review!

Back again, I am. Hope you all enjoyed the last chapter. It was really fun to write from another character's point of view. Back to Annie now though. Anyway, thank you for another review! I hope you all enjoy this chapter. Awww, Annie talks to someone new! I own nothing but my OC's. Enjoy and review!Love is made by two people, in different kinds of solitude. It can be in a crowd, but in an oblivious crowd- Louis Aragon26th August 1994 â€“ Very Early MorningAfter the events of the night before, Annie had trouble sleeping. Hell, probably everybody has had trouble sleeping, she thought from her makeshift bed from the couch. Mr Weasley had asked Tonks and Annie to stay in the girls' tent, to keep an eye on Ginny and Hermione. Needless to say, Annie was quite happy with the request, she didn't want to send the rest of the night alone in her room.And, so here they were. Annie was curled up in a bed of blankets on the couch, while Tonks was on the floor. Annie had only begrudgingly taken the couch because Tonks had threatened to hex her if she didn't."You've been hurt!" Tonks had argued. "You out of all people sure know how important rest is when you've been injured!"So, Annie had taken the couch while Tonks slept on the floor. Ginny and Hermione were in their room, fast asleep. Tonks was snoring slightly, and Annie could hear the soft breathing of the two girls in the other room. But Annie could not sleep.After reuniting with Chris, he walked her back to her tent. Annie wanted him to stay longer but he had to get back to work. Chris apologised over and over again, he himself didn't want to leave. But Annie understood. Work called. In fact, when she had got back to their tents, she had started fussing over everyone's injures, going into healer mode.She immediately went to Bill, who was holding a bed sheet stained with blood to his arm. Percy was near him, clutching his bloody nose. Sighing, she summoned some bandages and began to work on their wounds. By the time Mr Weasley returned with Harry, Ron and Hermione, she had just finished fixing up Percy's broken nose. After a rather heated discussion about who cast the Dark Mark â€“ the newcomers had reported it had been the House Elf sitting in the Top Box â€“ Mr Weasley had shooed them all to bed.And here Annie was, laying on the couch, unable to sleep. She considered getting her book but it was in the other tent. Sighing, she rolled over and dragged the blanket over her. She closed her eyes and tried to fall asleep. But every time she closed her eyes, all she feel was the pain. Annie shuddered. She had never experienced the Cruciatus Curse before and it wasn't something she would want to experience again anytime soon. Aware that she was shaking slightly, Annie sighed and got up. Perhaps some fresh air and a cup of tea would help her sleep.After making a cup of tea in the small kitchen, she quietly walked past Tonks' sleeping form and sat on the grass outside. The tents around her were mostly intact but they were mostly abandoned. Most people had fled the field, going home. Only a few had stayed back.Annie looked up at the sky. It was a clear night, it could almost be peaceful if the events of the night hadn't occurred. She remembered a time when she was younger, her parents had taken her camping. Her Dad didn't like it, but her Mum did."Look at the stars, Annie," She had said. "Aren't they beautiful?"Annie's mother was right. The stars were beautiful. She was so absorbed in watching the sky, she didn't notice the person walk up behind her."Hey," The person said. Annie looked up and saw Bill standing over her. "Can I sit here?""Yeah, sure," Annie nodded, going back to looking at the field. They sat in an awkward silence until Bill spoke again."Thanks for fixing up my arm," He said."No problem. It's kind of my job," Annie replied."So how's Chris? That was the first time I've seen him in, what? Five years?""Yeah, that's about right. He's fine. He's been busy with work lately."Bill nodded and didn't say anything."And how's the restaurant?""Fine. Dad says that's it's been quiet lately but he's says it'll pick up soon.""That's good."Then, the silence returned. It was different to the silence between Annie and Charlie. That silence was always tense, as though each person had something they needed to say, but couldn't. The silence with Bill was almost relaxing. Like Bill understood."How are you feeling?" Bill asked, once again breaking the silence."A lot better. Thanks for asking," Annie replied."We were all really worried, you know. Especially Charlie," Bill said. Brows furrowing, Annie turned to face Bill with a confused look on her face."Why would Charlie be worried?" She asked."Because he cares about you. A lot.""Why?""You're his friend," Bill replied quickly, avoiding Annie's eyes."Oh," Annie said, feeling disappointed? She didn't know. "I'd better get back to bed, I have work in the morning.""Ok," Bill said. "Bye Annie. Sleep well.""Bye Bill."Please review!

30 chapters! Didn't think I would get this far!so, I'm back again. For the third time this weekend. And hopefully, since it's half term, a few more updates this week. But no promises. And, yet again, I would like to thank IKhandoZatman for reviewing again. That's seven times now, out of sixteen. The rest of you have a lot of work to do! And I couldn't describe it any better, Bill the Matchmaker! Exactly what I was going for. Enjoy this chapter and please review!There are two kinds of sparks, the one that goes off with a hitch like a match, but it burns quickly. The other is the kind that needs time, but when the flame strikesâ€¦ it's eternal, don't forget that - Timothy Oliveira 26th August 1994 â€“ Early EveningAnnie sighed and flopped down on to the couch. It had been a long, tiring day. After getting back from the World Cup, Tonks immediately went to her parents' home, and Annie decided to follow suit. After numerous cups of tea â€“ Annie lost count â€“ and countless worried glances and questions from Andromeda, Annie went home. Well, she thought she would. She ended up doing a round trip to her Dad's, who had gotten a letter from a mysterious source asking if Annie was alright. So, obviously, she had to check in on her Dad, who was worried sick. Annie spent a good two hours in her childhood home, with her Dad fussing over her. And then, she had somehow been roped in to helping with the small, after work rush in the restaurant. Needless to say, Annie was knackered.Propping herself up on her elbow, Annie looked round the room. The flat had changed a lot over the years since she had moved in. The walls were now a pale blue colour, opposed to the horrible 'puke-your-guts-out-snot green' colour, as Chris had described it. The floor was made up of exposed oak floor boards, covered by a warm woollen rug in front of the carpet. At first, Chris had been opposed to the rug, disliking the colour red. But, after a while, Annie had prevailed in getting the rug.Speaking of Chris, Annie had not seen him since late last night, at the World Cup. Yes, he had sent an owl asking if she was alright, but it wasn't the same. He had clearly been home. There was a trail of evidence a mile long, from the papers carelessly strew across the coffee table, to the empty mug on the counter.Sighing, Annie got up and began to clear up. Ever since Chris had been promoted at the end of last year, he was barely home, spending most of his time at the Ministry. Now, it pleased Annie that Chris was doing what he loved, he was good at his job. But, Annie would be lying if she didn't admit she wasn't just a little upset that she barely spent any time with Chris now. They hadn't been on a proper date for at least a month now, and Chris's absence was putting a strain on their relationship.Annie opened the fridge, saw there was no milk, and decided it was as good an excuse as any to leave the house. Grabbing her wand, keys, and jacket, she hastily locked the door and walked down the stairs and onto Diagon Alley. There was a small shop on the street which sold everything Annie needed. She walked passed so many people, a lot of them children. Most likely shopping for school supplies. Annie took no notice of them, buried too deep in thought."Annie?" A voice from behind Annie brought her out of her thoughts. She turned, and saw, much to her surprise, Adam Cartwright."Adam?" She asked."Hey, Annie, how you doing?" Adam grinned."I'm great. How are you?" Annie smiled."Good, I'm fine." Adam stopped for a moment, running a hand through his hair. "Do you want to go grab a drink? So we can catch up?""Ok, then. Where to?""How about the Leaky Cauldron? It's just down the road.""Ok. Lead the way."After ordering their drinks, the two sat down in the table in the corner."So, who's the lucky woman?" Annie asked, indicating at the engagement ring on his hand. Adam chuckled, he had missed this about Annie."Mary Abrams, Lacey's younger sister. She was in our year at school, in Ravenclaw.""Oh, I remember her! You two make a good couple," Annie smiled."Thanks. So, how are you? Still with Chris?""Yeah.""How are things going?" Adam asked, causing Annie to stop for a minute."Good, yeahâ€¦" Adam raised an eyebrow."What? Are you not happy with him?""No! I mean yeah! I meanâ€¦" Annie stopped for a minute. "I love Chris, I really do but, I don't think I've met the right guy yet.""I get that. When you met the right one, there's just something there that's not in everybody. That little spark. But you only find it in the one you're meant to be with," Adam said with a distant look in his eye. He shook his head and laughed. "Look at me, getting all philosophical. I'd better get going, I have packing to finish.""Packing?" Annie said, looking confused."Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you. I got offered a job in America.""Adam! That's great news!" Annie exclaimed. "Congratulations!""Thanks Annie," Adam said, getting up. He went over and hugged Annie. "Stay in touch.""I will. I hope you enjoy America."Adam stopped, just before the door and turned back to face Annie."Hey, Annie? You'll find your someone soon. Don't worry about it."Annie smiled."Thanks Adam."Please review!

Whoop! Fourth update in a row! I am on fire! And more reviews! That is great! So, anyway, this is more of a filler chapter. I worked it out, this fanfic is going to be really long. But, I prefer it when they're longer, they are usually more detailed. Anyway, enjoy and review please!The best way to predict the future is to create it  -Abraham Lincoln29th August 1994As Annie walked through the dark halls of Hogwarts, she felt like something was missing. The noise of hundreds of students running through the halls, having fun and eager to learn magic. It had been four years since she had walked down these halls and yet, they hadn't changed a bit. All around her were memories of her childhood. Over there, by the third floor corridor, was where she was asked on her first date. And over there was where she had first jinxed someone, landing her a week's detention. But it was worth it.She neared the stone gargoyle which guarded the Headmaster's office and she stopped. What had Professor Sprout said the password was? It had changed since the last time she had been here."Mint Humbugs," Annie smiled, liking the password.Immediately, the large stone gargoyle jumped to one side, revealing a winding staircase. Annie walked up them, and was met with a large wooden door at the top. A bit unsure, Annie hesitantly knocked on the door."Come in," A voice from the other side echoed. Annie grasped the bronze door handle and opened the door into the large circular room. Professor Dumbledore sat behind a wooden desk in the centre of the room, reading some papers. He looked up when Annie walked in."Ah, Miss Ainsworth, it's a pleasure to see you again. Please, sit down," He said. Annie sat down on the seat on the opposite side of the desk."Thank you for having me, Professor," Annie said. She fiddled with her sleeve, she was very nervous."You're very welcome. If memory recalls, you were quite an impressive student during your school years," Dumbledore said, causing Annie to blush slightly. "Right then, to business. As part of your Healing course, you require a year's worth of work experience. Professor Sprout has asked personally, if you would be able to do that here.""Yes sir, that's right.""Well, in light of future events, we will be needing an extra pair of hands in the Hospital Wing this year. Do you know why?"Annie shook her head."No sir. My boyfriend works in the Ministry and he did lead on that something big was happening but he wasn't allowed to say what.""Yes, that's right. Well, Hogwarts has had the honour of being chosen to host the Triwizard Tournament, so, because of the number of students attending Hogwarts this year, Madam Pomfrey will require an extra pair of hands in the Hospital Wing. Now, I cannot think of a better person to fill in this position."Annie's face lit up and she smiled widely."Really?" Annie asked. Dumbledore smiled."Yes, Miss Ainsworth. From the reference from your Healing course, you seem like the ideal candidate.""Thank you, Professor.""You're welcome, Miss Ainsworth. I will send an owl with the details soon, but I will arrange for your accommodation to be in the school.""Thank you sir." Annie said, getting up. "I'll see you in September then.""Good bye, Miss Ainsworth. Enjoy the rest of your summer."Please review!

I'm back! Whoa, 22 reviews! That is excellent! When I saw the number 22, I, ironically enough, was listening to Taylor Swift's 22. Great song! So, the game is set. Both Annie and Charlie will be at Hogwarts this year. I wonder what will happen... Oh! And in response to people not liking Chris, I have something special planned for him...Mwhahaa. But, you'll have to wait and see. Charlie won't be present for another few chapters yet, but as a compromise, a special character will be in this chapter. Disclaimer - O won nothing but my OCs. Read and review!Age appears to be best in four things; old wood best to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust, and old authors to read- Francis Bacon1st September 1994 â€“ 10:15amAnnie was all packed and ready. Her trunk lay on her bed, with all her clothes, books and belongings all packed inside. She looked round her room and realised that it hadn't looked this empty since she moved in. Yes, her posters of the Holyhead Harpies were still up, as was her photos from over the years. But, from the lack of clothes in her wardrobe to her mostly empty bookshelf, it was like she hadn't even lived here. It was like this when she moved in. All she could think about back then was her Dad, being all alone. Now, all she could think about was how she was leaving Chris.He understood though. When she had told him about getting the internship at Hogwarts, he was over the moon. They had had a celebratory dinner the same night, after which, Annie forgot all about her sadness about barely seeing Chris.After finally checks to make sure she packed everything, she grabbed her bag, shrugged on her jacket and pulled her trunk out of her room. Chris was sat on the couch, with his back to Annie, pouring over some paperwork. Annie cleared her throat and she looked up."Annie!" He smiled. "Are you all ready?""Yep. All packed," Annie replied, dumping her trunk and sitting next to him. "Are you sure you're going to be alright? I could always just apperate there every day.""No. You go stay there, they'll need you. Don't you worry about me, enjoy your time there." Chris replied, brushing a piece of hair out of Annie's face."Okâ€¦But you'd better write!" Annie grinned, causing Chris to laugh."Ok then. I'll right every day, if you really want me to.""Good," Annie said. Chris leaned forward, and kissed her on the lips. Annie returned the kiss, and they stayed like that, for what seemed like hours."Ok then," Chris said, breaking away. "You'd better get going. I don't want you to miss the train.""Alright," Annie said and she stood up. "Don't work too hard," She teased. Chris laughed at this comment, while Annie picked up her trunk."Love you," Chris called."Love you too," Annie smiled before apperating.Platform Nine and Three Quarters was already filled with excited students and anxious parents. Annie reminisced about the first time she had been here, when she was just eleven years old. That was ten years ago but it still felt like yesterday. She weaved through the crowds, dodging the occasional enchanted paper airplane, dragon or bird. When she reached an empty compartment at the front of the train, she hauled her trunk on to the luggage shelf. Annie sat by the window and took out her book, very much like she did ten years early. God, that makes me sound old, Annie thought. At was a different book though. Instead, she was reading To Kill a Mocking Bird. Soon, all the eager students were on the train and the whistle sounded. The train began to pick up speed, leaving the train station far behind. All round the track was lush green fields, with only the occasional building in sight. Annie was too deeply entailed in her book, she didn't notice the compartment door open and someone walked in."Aren't you a little old to be at school?" The voice asked. Annie looked up and grinned."Cedric!" She cried. Annie jumped up and hugged him tightly. "Oh, it's great to see you!"Cedric had definitely changed since the last time Annie had saw him. He had grown. A lot. Annie remembered the first time she had met Cedric. He was a small, slightly scrawny, eleven year old boy who seemed to have buckets of energy to spare. When Annie had left, he had been a gangly, uncomfortable thirteen year old, whose body seemed too small for him. Cedric had matured greatly since the last time she had saw him. Good looks and still that same crooked grin."It's great to see you too," Cedric replied, releasing himself from Annie's hug."How have you been?" Annie asked, sitting down, never letting go of his hand. Cedric sat next to her."Good. I'm Seeker on the Quidditch team, and Captain too.""That's great! Have we won the Cup lately?""Not for a few years. So how's Healer training been?""It's been great. So interesting.""So why are you back here?" Cedric asked."Work placement," Annie explained. "I have to do a year's work experience somewhere apart from St Mungo's.""Cool. It's great that you're back. It must feel weird. Coming back.""You have no idea."Cedric grinned and his gaze went over Annie's shoulder. Annie turned and saw a pretty girl with long dark hair walk past. She stopped for a minute, saw Cedric looking at her, smiled and waved before continuing. Annie turned back and saw Cedric still looking. She shoved his shoulder, knocking him from his trance."Go get her," She smiled."Really? You don't mind me leaving?""Course not. Anyway, she's pretty. There'll be other boys after her so you have to get there first," Annie replied. Cedric grinned and stood up."See you Annie," He said."Bye Ced," Annie called as he walked down the corridor. Shaking her head, she returned to her book.Please review!

Hey, my great readers. Yet another update! Hope you enjoy it. We see Charlie again soon, so that should be good. Hope you enjoy this chapter! Read and review!We are driven by five genetic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun- William Glasser1st September 1994 â€“ EveningAnnie sat in her seat behind the staff table and watched the Sorting. She still remembered her nervousness at being sorted, and first in the year at that. At eleven years old, she would never have imagined that ten years later, she would be sitting with the staff and would have a job at Hogwarts. It may just be temporary, but Annie's heart still swelled with pride when she thought about it."HUFFLEPUFF!"Annie smiled as 'Cauldwell, Owen' became Hufflepuff. She vaguely wondered if he was related to Jack, a boy who was in seventh year when she was in fifth. He played keeper for the Quidditch team and had went on to work in the Ministry.When the last student had been sorted, the feast began. Although it wasn't as good as her Dad's cooking, the cooking of the Hogwarts House-Elves was a close second. After a large helping of steak and mashed potato, as well as a large piece of chocolate cake, Annie was stuffed. Soon, all the food had been cleared away â€“ with the exception of a few mint humbugs Annie had kept â€“ and Professor Dumbledore began his speech.It was similar to most years. Starting with the notice of no entry to the Forbidden Forest, continuing on to Mr Flich's endless list of banned items. Annie was positive that it had gotten even longer since she had left. But, it was Dumbledore's final annocement that cause the most uproar."It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year."A collective gasp went round the room. Annie, too, gasped. Quidditch couldn't be cancelled, Annie thought. It just couldn't! All around the room, everyone gaped. Annie could see Harry, Fred and George sitting by the Gryffindor table, mouths wide open. Cedric too, looked too shocked to speak from his seat by the Hufflepuff table."This is due," Dumbledore continued. "To an event that is starting in October."Annie smiled. At least Quidditch was being temporarily replaced by and event that, in comparison, did seem more exciting that the Quidditch Cup. After Dumbledore had explained what it was, Annie had quickly gone away and researched everything to do with it. She understood why she would be needed this year; it was very dangerous, many people had died or been injured over the years.The thunderous rumble from the bewitched stormy sky quickly silenced the Hall. The doors of the Great Hall were thrown open and in walked in a man with grizzled dark hair and an electric blue eye. Annie smiled as the man walked up the Hall. Tonks hadn't told her that Mad Eye had came out of retirement. She quickly realised that he must be the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Dumbledore shook Mad Eye's hand and muttered a few, inaudible words to him, before Mad Eye took a seat on the opposite side of the staff table to Annie.Dumbledore continued with his speech, introducing Mad Eye and continued with his speech about the Tournament. Fred's outburst at Dumbledore's annocement was the highlight of the speech as most of it was Dumbledore speaking while the students drank up every word. After explaining when the guests from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang would arrive, Dumbledore was nearly finished the speech."And, my final annocement, there will be a slight change in staffing this year. Because of the events taking place in the Castle this year, Healer Ainsworth from St Mungo's Hospital will be joining us this year. Please join me in welcoming her, and I'm sure she will do as good a job as Madam Pomfrey at looking after all of you."The Hall burst in to polite applause. The loudest applause came from the Weasley's, Harry and Hermione from the Gryffindor table, and Cedric and the other Seventh years from the Hufflepuff table as most of them remembered Annie. From next to Annie, Madam Pomfrey nudged her to stand up. Blushing, but smiling, Annie stood up. Happiness washed over her. She was back.Please review!

Hope you all liked the last chapter, this will probably be the last one this weekend. I have a lot of homework that needs doing, damn my teachers. Anyway, hope you all enjoy. Please, read and review!A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work- Colin Powell2nd September 1994It was strange to Annie, waking up in her new office by the Hospital Wing. She had yet to get used to her new surroundings, but thought that she would quickly get used to them. After a quick shower, she dressed in the white and red robes that Madam Pomfrey had given her. Annie definitely preferred these robes to the putrid lime green robes she had to wear at St Mungo's. If I ever open up a hospital, Annie thought, I would make sure that the Healers wore better colours than lime green. The shade of the green had many times given Annie a headache, it hurt your eyes if you stared at it too long. She much preferred her Hogwarts Healer uniform, or even the Muggle Doctor uniforms.When she looked presentable, with her hair tied up in a neat bun, she went up to breakfast. It was still quite early, so only a few pupils were dotted around the Hall. Annie assumed that most of the teachers had already eaten and had went up to their classrooms to prepare for their lessons. So, when she got there, Annie was the only member of staff sat at the table. She helped herself to tea and a croissant, before the Daily Prophet owl swooped down. Annie paid the owl, got her paper, before the owl flew away. She propped it up against the box of cereal and began to read it."Yer alright there, lassie?" A gruff voice sounded from behind Annie. She turned and saw May Eye Moody standing over her, electric blue eye focused on her."Yeah, I'm fine," Annie smiled. "Oh! I forgot to thank you for the tickets.""Tickets? What tickets?" Mad Eye barked. Annie raised her eyebrow."The tickets you got me and Tonks for the World Cup?" Annie replied."Yes, yes. Top Box, wasn't it? Yes, yesâ€¦" May Eye trailed off. "Best be going. Lots to do.""Ok then, Bye Mad Eye.""And don't forget!" Mad Eye exclaimed."What?""Constant vigilance!" May Eye barked before hobbling away.Still slightly confused by the conversation, Annie returned to her breakfast. But it was strange. Mad Eye remembered everything. Annie concluded that he was probably just getting forgetful in his age. After all, he was getting on. When Annie was finished her breakfast, there were more students sitting in the Hall. She picked up her newspaper, and left for the Hospital Wing. When she arrived, Madam Pomfrey was already there, sorting through vials of potions."Oh, there you are!" She smiled when she saw Annie. "Good. Now, for today, you're going to be on patient duty, while I sort up the supplies. Goodness gracious, the cupboards have gotten untidy over the holidays. Now, you just sit in the office, and wait for a student to come."She ushered Annie into the office and sat her down in the chair."There's some paperwork for you to do, in the meantime." Madam Pomfrey called as she left.Sighing, Annie picked up a quill and began to fill out what seemed to be endless sheets of paperwork. Sure enough, that day there were at least six students who dropped in, with injures ranging from cold to minor scratches from Care of Magical Creatures Classes. Needless to say, when dinner time came and Madam Pomfrey allowed her to go up, Annie was grateful.Although it was a lot less stressful than St Mungo's, and she was enjoying it, the day had passed quite slowly. However, Madam Pomfrey assured her that it would get busier as the school year progressed. Annie, still dressed in her uniform, headed down to the Great Hall. She decided to take the quicker route, choosing to go down the Grand Staircase. It was there, she saw Mad Eye levitating what appeared to be a pure white ferret. Several students around Mad Eye, including Harry and Ron, were laughing while Hermione stood with an expression that seemed torn between amusement and worry.Professor McGonagall quickly appeared and Annie decided it would probably be best if she went to help. She got there just as the ferret changed back into an arrogant, yet terrified, looking blonde haired boy who looked around the same age as Harry, Ron and Hermione. Professor McGonagall was in the middle of lecturing Mad Eye. Mad Eye's electric blue eye whizzed up and lingered on Annie. When Professor McGonagall saw Annie, she half smiled."Healer Ainsworth, it's good that you're here. Please will you take Mr Malfoy up to the Hospital Wing to check that he is alright?"Annie nodded, but the boy â€“ Malfoy â€“ mumbled something about being fine. Professor McGonagall's lips drew in to a thin line and she turned to May Eye and told him to take Malfoy to Professor Snape's office. Annie began to walk towards the Hall, but to Slytherin boys blocked her. One of them, who looked very much like a gorilla, mumbled something about beginning bitten by a Flobberworm in Care of Magical Creatures."Don't be stupid, Flobberworms don't have teeth so they can't bite you!" Annie exclaimed. "And if you were injured, then why didn't you go to the Hospital Wing after your lesson?"And with that, Annie walked off into the Hall, leaving two gobsmacked Slytherins in her wake. She heard a group of students snigger; probably Harry, Ron and Hermione. From out of nowhere, Professor McGonagall appeared next to her."Good job," She said. "Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle are the two biggest hypochondriacs you will ever meet. They will do anything to get Hagrid into trouble so watch out for them."Annie nodded, and as Professor McGonagall walked away, Annie realised that Professor McGonagall was probably one of the best teachers she had the privilege of working along side.Please review!

I'm back! And more reviews! So, first, I want to apologise in advance. Why, you may ask? Well, from now till the end of May, I have exams. Why is this a problem? I'll tell you. My teachers seem to think that giving us a seemingly endless heap of homework and revision exercises between now and May is the only way that we'll do good. I know on results day I will be thankful for this, but at the moment, I'm not. Oh, and my Health and Social coursework is really stacking up. Stupid teachers... Anyway, I've worked out this story is going to be long. Like REALLY long. The start of Order of the Phoenix sees about 60 chapters. Also, major story twist coming up! Hope you will like it. Well, until tomorrow. Read and please review!True friends stab you in the front- Oscar Wilde31st October 1994After the arrival of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students, and the unveiling of the Goblet of Fire, Annie was preparing for a busy day. She had a feeling that some students â€“ she knew which ones â€“ would probably come up with some hair-brained scheme to try and get into the Tournament. It wasn't long before the first patients began to drop in. After already treating two students, the third and fourth students came up to her. Annie couldn't help it, and burst out laughing at the sight of them.There before her, still towering over her, was Fred and George, looking a lot like copies of Dumbledore. Even with brilliant grey beards that would put Father Christmas to shame, they were still identical carbon copies of each other. The other's doppelganger. Through fits of laughter, Annie held up her hand to her mouth, to try and calm herself. I must look so unprofessional, she thought. But still, this was probably the single funniest moment of her entire career.Still glaring down upon Annie, Fred and George wore the same, surprisingly angry, expressions. They clearly weren't amused. However, their friend who stood behind them, Lee Jordan, clearly found it hilarious and was howling with laughter."You think this is funny?" One of the twins â€“ probably Fred â€“ asked. Annie held up her hand, unable to speak.Looking between the laughing Lee, and Annie, who was struggling to keep her giggles in, the twins soon started laughing. After a few minutes of laughter, Annie finally calmed herself down."Ok, Ok," She said. "Come on, I've got a job to do. Sit yourselves down on those beds over there. Lee, do you want to head up to your lesson?"Lee left, and Annie ushered the twins on to a set of empty beds and went to the store cupboard to get the correct potion. When she returned, they were sitting on the same bed, discussing something Annie couldn't hear."Let me guess, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?" Annie asked, raising her eyebrow. The twins jumped up, looking sheepish."Please don't tell Mum," Fred asked."Yeah, she'll kill us if she finds out," George added."Please?" The said in unison, using surprisingly convincing puppy dog eyes."Fine," Annie sighed. "But when she finds out, I was not part of it!"She gave them each a glass of potion, which they begrudgingly drank â€“ after a stern look from Annie. After the beards quickly shrank, Annie sent them on their way to lessons. Or, at least, she hoped they went to their lessons. After them, no other students came in so it was a rather slow day for Annie.Soon, it was time for the Halloween feast. After a feast last night to welcome the guests, Annie didn't feel like eating much so just eat a small bit, to be polite. She chatted with her fellow members of staff; having a very interesting conversation with Hagrid about Thestrals.Dumbledore stood forward, and began with his speech. The Goblet shone, bursting in to flames occasionally. He drew the first name â€“ Durmstrang â€“ and applause sounded through the room. Of course, it would have been Viktor Krum. Even Annie could have told you that. Viktor Krum, however, seemed unfazed by his selection, and instead, slouched off into the small chamber where the champions had to go. The Beauxbatons champion, Fleur Delacour, seemed very pleased with her choosing, gracefully gliding down the Hall. Her slivery blonde hair was elegantly thrown over her shoulder and she smiled sweetly. At the Ravenclaw table, Annie could see a number of Beauxbatons girls in tears for not being selected.The Goblet of Fire turned red again, and a slip of parchment flew out. Dumbledore caught it with ease. Every Hogwarts student and member of staff held their breath. This was it."And the Hogwarts Champion," Dumbledore said loudly. "Is Cedric Diggory!"Like Professor Sprout, Annie was one of the first to burst into applause for the Hogwarts' Champion. Every Hufflepuff gathered round their table shot up, screaming and cheering. Most of them surged towards Cedric, clapping him on the back and shaking his hand. Annie caught Cedric's eye and he grinned widely at her. Annie rolled her eyes, but still smiled.Dumbledore resumed speaking, congratulating the champions but Annie was barely listening. Although she was worried for her friend, she was still pleased for him. And proud. Other Houses thought Hufflepuff was the less talented house, but that was wrong. Hufflepuff had produced the fewest Dark wizards, was extremely loyal, and had produced wizards like Newt Scamander, who was a very famous Magizoologist. But, with Cedric being chosen, it was finally a chance to prove to the world that Hufflepuff was just a good a house as the others.In her thoughts, Annie's gaze fell upon the Goblet of Fire. It had stared to produce red flames again. Strange, Annie thought, it shouldn't be doing that. By now, everyone, even Dumbledore, was looking at the Goblet, with expressions mixed from confusion and misunderstanding. A fourth piece of parchment flew out and, like the others, Dumbledore caught it swiftly. He stared at the parchment in shock and was silent. Everyone was. All eyes were on Dumbledore, everyone was holding their breath. You could hear a pin drop in the silence. At last, Dumbledore called out in a strained voice;"Harry Potter."Every eye turned to Harry. Annie could see him going ready, and looking shocked. No one clapped. This wasn't right. There was only supposed to be three champions, not four. Annie realised that Harry couldn't have put his name in the Goblet, it was way beyond the power of a fourteen year old boy. Someone planned this. But who? After Dumbledore called Harry's name again, the boy in question shakily made his way down the hall. Annie felt sorry for the boy, he clearly had no idea how this had happened and was just as shocked as everyone else. The next few weeks would be hard on Harry so Annie hoped that his friends would help him through.Please review!

Second update. Yeahy, more reviews! And, nearly 10,000 reads! So, thanks for all the lovely reviews, please keep them coming. Also, can anyone guess when Annie will finally reveal her feelings for Charlie? Believe me, it's a bumpy road for her. Anyway, read and enjoy! P.S. longest chapter yet. Just saying, I expect more reviews for this one.Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy- Sai Baba22nd November 1994"Annie!" A voice called from the Hospital office."Coming!" Annie shouted back, putting away the spare bandages. She had just finished treating a third year, who had burned his hand in Potions. Annie walked into the office and saw Madam Pomfrey sitting behind the desk, flicking through a report."Yes, Madam Pomfrey?" Annie smiled.Madam Pomfrey looked up and smiled."Annie. Please, sit down," She said, gesturing to an empty chair. Annie did, and turned to look at the Matron."Annie, how is Mr Andrews?" Madam Pomfrey asked."All bandaged up and on his way to lunch," Annie replied."Good, good. Now, I called you here to discuss what will happen over the next few days," Madam Pomfrey began. "The First Task is tomorrow and we have to be on hand in case of emergencies. Now, the first task involves dragons, heavens know why they choose them. If they get loose, they could kill half the school!" She exclaimed, clearly annoyed. "Anyway, I want you to head down there, check up to see how the Dragonologists are doing.""Ok, Madam Pomfrey," Annie said, getting up."Oh, and Annie!" Madam Pomfrey called. Annie turned round."Yes?""Remember to take plenty of bandages and potions. My guess is that some of them will have already injured themselves.""Ok," Annie replied, leaving the room.After throwing all the bandages she thought she would need into a bag, Annie walked out of the Hospital Wing and down the front steps. When she past Hagrid's Hut, she saw him outside, teaching a class of third years. Annie smiled and waved at him; she had always liked Hagrid and his love of interesting, if somewhat deadly, creatures.The Forbidden Forest was dark, even for the daytime. Wand out, just in case, Annie cautiously walked through the forest. She was on edge, she had only been to the forest a few times in her life â€“ on the sly, though, students weren't allowed in. But she had been told about the dangers that lurked deeper in the forest. Unfortunately, the dragon pavilion was quite far into the forest so Annie had a long, spine tingling walk.A large tent was pitched in the middle of the clearing. But that was not what Annie was focused on. Four enormous, scaly dragons, fenced in to a large pavilion, all roaring with cascades of fire erupting from their mouths. Each dragon was a different colour; one was silvery blue with long, pointed horns; one was emerald green, smooth scaled; another scarlet red, with golden scales that reflected in the light; and the final dragon was coal black, with eerie amber eyes and bronze horns. Sharp looking spikes protruded from the last dragon's tail and it definitely looked like the most vicious dragon there. Swedish Short-Snout, Welsh Green, Chinese Fireball and the Hungarian Horntail. Annie identified each dragon easily. She had read about them, but this was the first time she'd ever seen a dragon in person."Healer Ainsworth?" A voice asked from behind. Annie turned and saw a middle aged man with thinning brown hair and muscled arms that had numerous burns and blisters on them."Yeah, that's me," Annie replied. The man visibly relaxed."Thank Merlin. It's great that you're here now, we've already had half a dozen injures because of that bloody Horntailâ€¦ Anyway, my name's Neil, I'm the Head Dragonologist around here," He said, holding out his hand. Annie shook it and smiled."Nice to meet you. Please, call me Annie.""'Course. Come on, I'll show to the medi-bay," Neil said, leading Annie towards the large tent.Inside, it was similar to the tent Annie and Tonks had stayed in at the World Cup. Bigger on the inside. The main room was some kind of rec room, with comfy looking couches and a roaring fire in the grate on the far side. It was two stories; with a railed off landing up above, and there were numerous doors leading to what Annie assumed would be bedrooms."Canteen's over there," Neil said, pointing to another door on the ground floor. "And through here-" Neil pushed a curtain partition open. "-Is the medi-bay."The medi-wing was a long room, lit with natural light coming from the windows. The room was split; the first half was open and airy and was obviously to be used as a waiting room. The far half of the room was split in to little cubicles by the curtain partition."And here we are," Neil said, looking round the room. "I can't tell you how good it is to have a Healer here now.""Is there many injured?" Annie asked."Nothing to serious but about half a dozen. Mostly burns though, so easily enough healed."Annie nodded, her eyes studying the room."So, is it alright to leave you to get set up?" Neil asked."Yes, of course," Annie smiled. "I'll set up in the first cubicle and you can just send people in.""Great. I'll leave you to it then."The cubicle was surprisingly roomy, fitting in a bed, a table and even a cabinet filled with medical supplies. Annie emptied the bag, restocking the cabinet, when she heard the first patient walk in. She turned round."Hello, my name is -" Annie stopped abruptly. "Charlie?"Sure as the sky was blue, Charlie Weasley stood in front of her, down to the last freckle. His expression mirrored Annie's, a mixture of surprise, shock and confusion."Hey, Annie," Charlie said unsurely, his eyes glancing all over the room."Um, hi Charlie. Didn't expect to see you here.""Yeah, it was a bit of a last minute thing."Annie nodded and they both stood there, in an awkward silence."So, what's happened?" Annie asked, breaking the ice."Oh, just a burn. I think its fine though! Don't know why I came, it's not even that bad-" Charlie said hurriedly. He made for the door but Annie quickly grabbed his arm."Charlie! This looks really bad! Here, sit on the bed," Annie said, fussing over the wound."Seriously, it's fine!" Charlie exclaimed. "It looks worse than it is."Annie sent him a glare, which quickly silenced him."Bed. Now." She said firmly, grabbing bandages and potions. Reluctantly, Charlie sat on the bed, while Annie dressed the wound."How's that feel?" Annie asked."Good. Almost nice," Charlie replied. Annie focused on the wound, mostly ignoring Charlie. "There. That should do it.""Are you watching the First Task tomorrow?" Charlie asked."Yeah. But mostly I'll be in the tent, treating the injures. Are you?""Yeah, I'm on hand in case the dragons break loose.""Well, let's hope that doesn't happen."Soon, the wound was bandaged up nicely. Charlie stood up, and made a beeline for the door. Before he reached it, however, he stopped."Hey, Annie?" He said, looking back at her. Annie looked up from packing away the bandages."Yeah?"Charlie stood there for a moment, shifting uncomfortably."See you tomorrow," He said, his gaze breaking away from Annie's."Ok, see you then," Annie smiled. Charlie managed a grin before leaving quickly. But Annie felt strange. Just for a minute. She had saw something in his eyes. For a moment, it looked like he hadn't finished speaking. And for a second, Annie didn't want him to leave.Please review!

Whoa! 10,000 views! Just great! Anyway, more Annie x Charlie in this chapter. Bit of fluff really. So, hopefully I'll update again tomorrow. Oh, and thank you for the lovely reviews! Thanks for predicting the future but you're not all the way there! I'll give you a few hints. Annie will be with Charlie but the end of 1995 (mid-way through Order of the Phoenix), MAJOR plot twist with Barty Crouch, and a LOT of drama. Can anyone guess what? Enjoy and review!I don't ever really notice when guys are hitting on me. I'm oblivious.  - Krista Allen24th November 1994 Part 1Annie sat in the tent, waiting and bored. It was the day of the first task and she was waiting for the event to begin. She had just finished organising the potions and balms Madam Pomfrey thought they would need; nearly all of them were designed to work with burns. Annie sighed, until the first task started, it was going to be a boring day. Outside the tent, she could hear the roars of the dragons over the noise of the hundreds of chattering spectators. However, the noise of her grumbling stomach drowned out everything."Hungry?" A voice from behind asked, causing Annie to jump in surprise. She turned and saw Charlie standing in the doorway, sheepish grin on his face."Charlie! What are you doing here?" Annie asked smiling."Well," Charlie said, walking into the makeshift office. "We've just finished putting the dragons into the enclosure and were given half an hour for lunch. I couldn't find you so I thought you'd be in here. I also thought you'd be hungry, so I brought this." He said, holding up a bag."You brought lunch?" Annie smiled."Yep. I've got chicken and stuffing sarnies, butterbeer, apples, grapes and the best caramel shortbread the Hogwarts kitchen has to offer."Annie sat there, slightly shocked. Her mouth hung up slightly. Charlie set the basket on the table and sat down."What?" Charlie asked when he looked at her."Thi-This is all my favourite food," Annie said in disbelief. Charlie shrugged."Didn't know. Must have been a luck guess," He said quickly, looking anywhere but Annie's eye. Annie just shrugged it off and picked up a sandwich."This is good," She commented. She turned to look at Charlie, who had a mouthful of sandwich."What?" He mumbled, through a mouthful. Little bits of sandwich sprayed out. Annie put her hand on her mouth to stifle a laugh, but it when Charlie looked at her, mouth wide, distant look in his eye, it just slipped out."What's so funny?" Charlie asked, swallowing the last bite."Just you!"Charlie grinned."Am I just that funny?" He asked, while Annie was in fits of laughter. She nodded, between laughs. "Well, I'll make you laugh more!"Before Annie realised what was going on, Charlie's hands reached her middle and he started tickling her."Charlie!" Annie shrieked, in between fits of laughter. "Knock it off! I'm ticklish!""Really?" Charlie asked. He began tickling her even more."Nah!" Annie exclaimed. "Charlie Weasley, you are so dead!""What's going on here?" A voice asked.Immediately, Annie sat up, pushing Charlie's hands away."Madam Pomfrey!" She exclaimed breathlessly.Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Charlie smirk slightly. She made a mental note to get back at him later."Annie, you can go watch the first part. I'll only call for you if I need you," Madam Pomfrey said. She turned to look at Charlie. "And you, Mister Weasley, I think your colleagues are looking for you.""Yes, ma'am. I'll- I'll just be on my way," Charlie said quickly, face reddening. He shot out of the room, avoiding Madam Pomfrey's gaze."Right, then," Annie said quickly. "I'll clear up and go-""Annie," Madam Pomfrey said. Annie turned to look at the woman. "Go have some fun. Charlie seems like a nice boy." Madam Pomfrey said knowingly."W-We're not like that!" Annie said quickly. "We're just friends, that's all!"Madam Pomfrey just gave her pointed look."I was young too, once Annie," She said.Annie, with her face nearly Weasley red, quickly scurried from the tent.Charlie was waiting just outside the tent, talking to Ron and Ginny. The two younger Weasleys left, Ginny smiling sweetly at Annie before she did."Well, that was awkward," Annie said, joining Charlie."Yeah, kinda. Do you want to go grab a seat?" Charlie said, looking down at her."Ok, but I'll have to stay near to the tent."Charlie nodded and led the way to the seats in the large arena. Most of the seats were already filled, but the two managed to get good seats.Cedric was up first. He walked in to the enclosure, looking slightly green. Annie caught his eye and gave him a reassuring smile. He smiled back weakly, but still looked nervous. Annie could hardly blame him. He was the first one up, and had virtually no idea what he was up against. At least he didn't have the Horntail; Annie pitted the person who had to go up against that.The Swedish Short-Snout roamed round the arena, oblivious to Cedric's presence. Cedric stood there for a minute, looking like he was contemplating on what to do. He took cover behind a large rock, easily bigger than he was. He kept shooting glances around the rock, at the nest of eggs the Dragon stayed close too."The Champions have to get the golden egg from the nest of eggs," Charlie explained quietly. "It'll have a clue about the next task."Annie nodded and her attention back to Cedric. He was muttering a spell at a nearby rock, casting quick glances at the dragon. Suddenly, the rock turned into large, collie dog. Cedric grinned, and tossed a stone for the dog to chase. The dog quickly followed it, leaving the cover of the rock. The dragon easily saw it, and roared, smoke erupting from its nostrils.Cedric silently slid round the other side of the rock, out of the dragon's view. He had nearly reached the golden egg when the dragon quickly decided that it didn't want the dog and turned to the nest. Cedric had barley grabbed the egg when the dragon let out a torrent of fire. Some of it hit Cedric.Annie grabbed Charlie's hand tightly as half of the flames engulfed Cedric. She could faintly hear Cedric's moan of pain. He quickly reappeared, mostly unharmed with the exception of the large burn down the side of his face. Annie let out a sigh of relief, happy that her friend wasn't too badly harmed."Can I have my hand back?" Charlie's voice brought her attention back to reality. Annie realised just how tightly she was holding his hand."Sorry!" She exclaimed, quickly realising her hand. She noted how Charlie's hand slightly lingered for a minute. "I have to go, Madam Pomfrey will need me-""Annie?" Charlie said. Annie looked up at him, into his deep blue eyes."Yes?""D-Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me?" He asked, almost hopeful.Annie smiled."Alright then. As friends, right?"Charlie's smiled faltered slightly, but he quickly recovered."Yeah. Of course. Just friends."Please review!

What up, my great readers? Aren't you lucky? Charlie Chapter! The date that's not a date! Hope you all enjoy it. Also, IMPORTANT QUESTION! I really need someone to answer this. Should I split this into another book at the beginning of Order of the Phoenix? If so, what could I call it? Please, I really need an answer. Anyway, enjoy this chapter! Please read and review!If only the strength of the love that people feel when it is reciprocated could be as intense and obsessive as the love we feel when it is not, then marriages would be truly made in heaven - Ben Elton10th December 1994She said yes. Annie Ainsworth agreed to go with Charlie Weasley to Hogsmeade. Although Charlie knew it wasn't a date, it was just as friends, he still felt giddy with excitement every time he thought about it. Not that he would tell anyone though; if his brothers got wind of him acting like a little girl in love, he would never hear the end of it.He checked his watch for the fifth time that morning. Nine forty five. He was meeting Annie in the Entrance Hall at ten. Merlin, he was nervous. Did he look nervous? He quickly looked in the mirror. His face wasn't red, which was one thing. Did he look alright? Wearing his cleanest jeans with his red Weasley jumper with a large yellow 'C' on it. He didn't look to casual, did he?Deciding that it was too late change, Charlie quickly grabbed his jacket and left the room. The Entrance Hall was mostly empty, with the exception of a few lingering students who were waiting to meet up with friends to go to Hogsmeade. He waved at all of his brothers and Ginny as they passed; the twins grinning widely and making kissing noises as they passed. Charlie rolled his eyes and tried to brush it off but he could feel his face redden slightly."Charlie?" Charlie looked round and saw Annie standing behind, smiling sweetly."Hey, Annie," Charlie said with a goofy grin.Annie smiled widely and Charlie took in her appearance. Her curly blonde hair was tied back in a side plait, her head covered with a dark red hat. She was wearing dark wash jeans, brown boots, a warm looking wool coat and a pretty grey scarf with a fox knitted on it. Her bag was slung over her shoulder and she was pulling a pair of gloves on."Ready?" She asked.Charlie nodded and they began the walk down to the village. They talked and chatted about trivial things; Quidditch and dragons; school and the Tournament. Charlie tried to steer the topic away from anything that would give away his feelings for Annie. Although he couldn't change his feelings for her, he understood she was in a serious relationship. She would never go for him."Where do you want to go first?" Annie asked, snapping Charlie from his thoughts."Oh, umâ€¦Do you want to go grab a coffee?" He said."Ok, where from?""Ummâ€¦." He said, stopping in front of Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. He really hated this shop but Annie might like it. "Here?"Annie looked at the shop, with a fervent look of abhor, mixed with shock and disgust."It looks like Cupid threw up," She stated bluntly. Charlie relaxed slightly; she wasn't one of those girly girls who loved the colour pink."How about we go to the Three Broomsticks instead?" Charlie said."Yes. Definitely. Hell, I'd rather go to Hog's Head than that Tea Shop."Charlie laughed, albeit a little unsurely. They made their way to the pub, Charlie leading the way. The two found a table in the crowded room, a small round one in the corner of the room. The room itself was packed with Hogwarts students and staff alike, some of which (the twins) kept shooting Charlie knowing glances. Thankfully, however, Annie did not see them."Hi, Rosmerta," Annie greeted as the landlady came over to take their orders."Hello, Annie. What can I get you?""Just a butterbeer, please. Charlie, what do you want?""Charlie Weasley?!" Madam Rosmerta exclaimed. She turned to face Charlie. "It's been a while! How's working with the dragons?""Good, great. How are you doing?" He asked politely."I'm fine thank you. What are you having?""Just a butterbeer too, please."Rosmerta nodded, sent a knowing smirk to Charlie, before bustling away."That's a blast from the past," Charlie said, turning back to Annie."Yeah, this the first time you've been back since you left school?" Annie asked."Yep. And it hasn't changed a bit."Annie smiled, before placing her bag on the table."Are you going to the school reunion next week?" She asked, looking through her bag."Yeah, I think so. It'll be nice to catch up with people. Are you?""Yeah. Me and Tonks are going together, but Chris can't make it."They'd arrived there. The awkward topic Charlie so desperately hoped they could avoid. The topic of Chris Redmayne.Charlie hated Chris with a passion. Not only because he was the reason that Annie couldn't be with him, but because he was an annoying, pompous bighead who could give Percy a run for his money on being the next Minister of Magic. He was arrogant, caring for no one but himself, but at the same time convincing everyone that he was their best friend.Chris hated Charlie back though. Charlie knew this. It was obvious. In their final year of school, Charlie secretly recruited Fred and George to help prank the self-centred, big headed, Head Boy. Unfortunately, Chris had put one and one together and concluded that the Weasley's were behind his amazing transfiguration into a Canary. In front of the whole school. Charlie secretly knew that it was Annie who dissuaded Chris from giving the Weasley brothers detention for the rest of their school lives.Across the table, Annie was rummaging through her bag, pulling various items out. A hairbrush here, a book on healing there. The strangest thing she pulled out was the latest edition of the Quibbler, which surprised Charlie. He hadn't pegged her as the type to read the slightly lunatic magazine. At last, Annie pulled out her purse."Finally!" She cried. "I knew I put it in here!"She went to get some money out of it, when Charlie held up his hand."I've got this," He said."What? No, I don't mind paying.""No, seriously. I'll pay. I want to."Annie looked at him for a minute, studying his face. She shrugged and put her purse back in her bag."Suit yourself. Thanks anyway."There was an awkward silence as the two sipped their drinks."So, the Quibbler?" Charlie questioned. Annie blushed slightly."Yeah, wellâ€¦I know people say it's full of rubbish but I find it interesting.""You find articles on make believe creatures interesting?" Charlie asked, eyebrow raised slightly."You don't know if they're not real. Muggles don't believe in wizards and magic, and yet here we are. Just because people don't believe something exists, doesn't mean it doesn't."Charlie nodded. She posed a good point. The two continued to talk until dinner time, when Annie had to get back to work. Charlie walked her back to the Hospital Wing, making jokes all the way. He then went back to the tent where he was staying. With a contemplating look on his face, he sat down to write a letter to the brother you would least expect him to.Dear Percy,Hope you're doing alright. Don't be working too hard! Anyway, I know this is a weird request but I was wondering if you could tell be a little about what Chris Redmayne is like?He smiled as he wrote the letter, laughing at Percy's probably reaction. He made note to subscribe to the Quibbler when he was finished. After all, just because people think something doesn't exist, doesn't mean it doesn't.Please review!

Bonus chapter! At the request of IKhandoZatman and also because I thought it would be fun to write. Please enjoy and review. Another chapter posted next!A brother is a friend provided by nature.- Legouve Pere11th December 1994Working for the Ministry of Magic had pretty much prepared Percy Weasley for literally anything that could happen. International war, escaped dragon in the middle of London, anything. But working for the Ministry of Magic for nearly have a year could not have prepared him for what he faced now.A letter from Charlie.Now, what you need to know is that out of all of his brothers, Percy was probably least close to Charlie. This was because they were in fact, polar opposites. Charlie preferred outdoor environments, Percy preferred office environment. Charlie loved to travel and face danger, while Percy would rather work a nine to five job in an office all day. Needless to say, the brothers were not very close because of their different interests. But that didn't mean that they couldn't turn to each other in times of need.In fact, Percy admired his older brother for the qualities he possessed. Hell, all of the younger Weasleys did. Because Charlie was just, well, Charlie. He wasn't perfect, but in the eyes of his younger siblings, boy did he come close. Unlike Bill, who, at times, could be rather bossy at times, Charlie was always the more care free brother, who the younger ones looked up to after Bill left.This is why the letter shocked him.Charlie, the great Charlie Weasley who seemed to be able to solve everyone else's problems, was asking Percy for help. That is what shocked Percy Weasley.Never in his life had Percy thought that Charlie would need help. And, he was asking Percy. Said boy couldn't believe it. Charlie must really be desperate. Percy looked back and reread the letter, just to be sure he'd gotten the gist of the letter.Dear Percy,Hope you're doing alright. Don't be working too hard! Anyway, I know this is a weird request but I was wondering if you could tell be a little about what Chris Redmayne is like? I know it's a little out of the blue, but I was just wondering, what's he like? Just you know, little things like where he lives, how much time he spends at work, if he has any possibly fatal medical conditions. Just kidding. I'm notSo, anyway, hope you're doing alright. Mr Crouch had better not be piling up the work! See you at the Yule Ball, I heard you're going. -CharlieTo the untrained eye, it looked like Charlie needed to know basic facts about Chris Redmayne. So, he was probably planning something.But to Percy, Percy who had grown up as part of the Weasley family, who had two younger twins brothers who lived for chaos, a curse breaker older brother, a bloody Dragonologist, a sister who's Bat Bogey Hex was lethal, and a brother who was, not only best friends with Harry Potter, but also part of the group who seemed to find themselves in constant danger, the letter was more than it seemed.Percy remembered his school years. Or, more specifically, the first four years when Charlie was at Hogwarts. Charlie hated Chris Redmayne. But Percy couldn't blame him. Chris Redmayne was a prat, if you would pardon Percy's language. Merlin, probably every Weasley, even the younger ones who had never meet him and had only heard tales of him, hated Chris Redmayne. Every Percy's own father disliked Chris, and that was saying something. Chris Redmayne was up there on Arthur's hit list. Not as high up as Lucius Malfoy, but still high up.The only reason why Charlie Weasley would want to know facts about Chris Redmayne is because of the topic of Annie Ainsworth.Charlie's reaction to seeing Annie at the World Cup came as no surprise to Percy. Charlie's feelings for Annie were clearly obvious to everyone except Annie herself. Charlie was not the best at hiding them. He went red every time Annie spoke to him, and stuttered slightly when the two were talking. Hell, half of Hogwarts knew Charlie's feelings for Annie.But, despite all that, the two were clearly the perfect couple.They were made for each other, in Percy's eyes. Their attributes just complimented the others, creating the perfect balance.Now, Percy would be lying if he didn't admit that in his younger, slightly naÃ¯ve, school years, that he didn't have feelings for Annie. They had quickly vanished as he had gotten older, and he now say her as an older sister.And that was why he would make it his job to help Charlie to help Annie to see the man Chris Redmayne really was. And then, Annie and Charlie could be together.Please review!

Second update today! That means I expect twice the number of reviews! Anyway, a plot twist in this chapter. I'll let you read about it but hopefully, the gears on your brain will start to tick... Anyway, this chapter was so much fun to write! I love Tonks as a character. Also, any ideas for a sequel? Either PM me, or write your ideas in the reviews! Next chapter is the Yule Ball! Please, read, review, and most importantly, enjoy!Since I was five, I've known that I was adopted, which is a politically correct term for being clueless about one's own origins - Jodi Picoult20th December 1994"Cut loose! Footloose!" Tonks sang as she bounced round Annie's apartment. "Come on, Annie! You're missing all the good music!""I can hear it from in here!" Annie called back. "Your dulcet voice carries!""Oi! Are you taking the mick?" Tonks asked as Annie walked into the room."What, me? Course not. You have a very lovely voice," Annie grinned. "Now, honestly. Do I look alright?"Annie gestured to her white lace dress with thin brown belt, and her cream court shoes. Her hair was straight for the occasion; complements to the new hair potion she had bought. She wore more make up than usual, blusher on her cheeks, a pretty shade of brown eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and red lipstick."Annie! You look great! Are you sure you're not going on a date without telling me? Whoever he is, he's a lucky bloke!"Annie blushed furiously."Tonks! Seriously? Come on, we'd better get going," She said, grabbing her jacket."Whaoo! Booze time!" Tonks exclaimed."Don't you dare drink too much! The last time you did, I was the one who had to drag you home. And let me tell you, you were like the weight of a killer whale!""Annie! How could you say such a thing?" Tonks pretended to look upset. "I'll have you know, I only weigh the size of a walrus, thank you very much!"The two girls burst out into fits of laughter. Tonks was the first to recover."But seriously, the only reason you had to drag me is because you have the body of a little girl! Really, I've seen toddlers with more muscles than you!" Tonks said, prodding Annie's arm."Shove off," Annie grinned. "Come on, let's go!"The two girls apperated to Hogsmeade, and made their way into the Three Broomsticks, where the back room had been hired out for the school reunion. Already, there was easily half of their school year there. Mostly Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws and Gryffindors though, Annie hardly expected some of the Slytherins to show up. But then again, there were a few of the not half bad Slytherins dotted round the room.Tonks made a beeline for the bar, ordering two glasses of Firewhiskey, and downing one glass in a minute."You want to lay of the drink there, Rummy?" Annie joked. Tonks simply grinned."Annie, I have Auror exams in less than two weeks. I need a bloody strong drink. We can't all be winos like you.""Who's a wino?" A voice asked from behind. The two girls turned and saw Charlie standing there, drink in hand. Tonks grinned."Well, look who decided to show up! Fancy buying a girl a drink, Charlie?" Tonks grinned. Annie just rolled her eyes playfully, whereas Charlie just grinned goofily."How about I buy two girls a drink?" He said."You don't have to-" Annie began but Tonks cut her off."Yes he does! I'll have another Firewhiskey, Charlie. Thank you!""Annie? What can I get you?" Charlie asked, looking down at her.Annie was silent for a minute. She didn't even realise. She was thinking about how even with heels on, Charlie was still taller than her. Charlie, with his fiery red hair and tanned musclesâ€¦"Annie?" Charlie asked, breaking her from her thoughts."Oh, I'll have a gin and tonic," She smiled, slightly distant from the conversation.What in the world had possessed her to think that? She was in a relationship, for Merlin's sake!Annie spent that night mingling with old classmates, catching up with old friends she hadn't seen in years. It was fun, but she watched how much she drank. She had work in the morning and someone out of Annie and Tonks had to say relatively sober (Tonks wasn't looking like she would). And anyway, Annie wasn't a big drinker. Probably because growing up in a restaurant environment, she knew the possibly disastrous effects of getting too drunk.When it got to midnight, she decided that they had stayed out long enough. A lot of people had already left, and there was something about staying out after midnight that put Annie off. She weaved through the mostly intoxicated crowd, trying to find Tonks. A Weird Sisters song â€“ Annie's favourite band â€“ was playing.As Annie had half expected, Tonks was by the bar, looking very, very drunk."Annie!" She exclaimed. "Where have you been?! You missed all the fun!""Did I? Aww, that's a shame," Annie smiled. The trick to dealing with a drunk Tonks was to treat her as if she were a child. "Come on, we'd better get going.""Aww, but Annie! I want to stay!" Tonks whined."Come on, Tonks, I've got a bottle of Firewhiskey at home," Annie tempted her. This seemed to lighten Tonks' mood."Whaoo! Let's go!" Tonks said, staggering off of her chair, her legs just about giving way. "Oopsy daisy!"Annie quickly secured an arm around Tonks' waist and with her arm slug over her shoulder, Annie began to drag Tonks from the room."That's it, say bye, Tonks!""Bye bye," Tonks smiled, her head dropping slightly."Need a hand there?" Charlie said as he suddenly appeared next to Annie."Would you mind? She weighs a ton!"Charlie chuckled as he quickly grabbed Tonks' other arm and with the combined efforts of Annie and Charlie, they managed to drag her outside."So, how come you're not as drunk as most people there?" Annie asked."I made the rather wise decision not to drink too much. After all, with four siblings up at the castle, it would only end badly.""Good choice.""How come you aren't drunk?" Charlie asked. Annie chuckled."Well, unlike some people, I'm not a lightweight. I can hold my drink.""Oh, yeah, because you're part Irish, right?" Charlie asked.Annie stopped, slightly abruptly."How did you know that?" She questioned curiously."Iâ€¦urrâ€¦Overheard you and Tonks talking about it at the World Cup," Charlie said quickly, avoiding Annie's gaze. She nodded slightly and continued walking."You know," She said, slowly and softly. "I'm not technically half Irish."This surprised Charlie."How so?" He asked. Annie paused for a minute."My mum was adopted when she was about nine? Auntie Arabella adopted her, but I don't think she heard anything from her real family. I even think Mum had a younger brother. I've never even met them."Charlie nodded, unsure of what to say."So, then," He said, breaking the awkward silence that had formed. "Are you going to the Yule Ball?" He asked."Yeah. Since I'm officially a member of staff, I have to. Are you?""Yeah, it's should be fun. Ron has to wear these proper ancient dress robes.""That should be funny. When do you go back to Romania?""Not till at least July. I wanted some time off to watch the Tournament and the dragon reserve wanted someone to stay over here to deal with the Ministry and stuff," He explained, kicking a stone."Oh, that's too bad.""It has its advantages," Charlie smirked. "Anyway, I missed the rain."Annie laughed, a genuine laugh."Who would miss the rain?" She asked. "Anyway, I can manage from here, go get yourself away home.""You sure?"Annie waved him off."I'll be fine. I've dealt with a drunk Tonks many times before. I'll see you at the Yule ball.""Wear something nice!" Charlie called back as he walked away. Annie simply rolled her eyes and disapperated back home.Please review!

44 reviews? That's great! And over 50 follows! In honour of this, because I'm in a nice mood, another chapter! (And because it was either this or do my history homework). I might update again tomorrow, depending on how much homework those teachers give me. AS exams suck! Anyway, enjoy and please review!A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she wearsAnne Roiphe25th December 1994Annie smoothed down the shirt of her dress and checked her appearance in the mirror. Her formal dress was made from silky white fabric, with embroidered gold sequins sown on the sleeves and the hem of the skirts. When Annie moved, even just the slightest, they sparkled in the light. On her feet where matching gold heels, with straps around the ankles. Annie's curly hair was brushed back into a messy but elegant bun and a decorative hair band held back any stray curls. Her mother's garnet earrings hung down, matching her red lipstick. Like the other night, she was wearing a bit more eye makeup than usual, but the effects of the brown eye shadow were too pretty to leave out."Annie, are you ready?" Hermione asked from behind, standing next to Ginny. The two girls had asked for Annie's help in getting ready and Annie was more than happy to help. After giving Hermione a potion that caused her hair to go from unruly hair to sleek curls, Annie had helped the girls with their makeup. Both of them hadn't had much experience with makeup as neither girl had an older sister. The three girls had bonded over getting ready, sharing trivial secrets such as their favourite flower and sweet."You look really pretty," Ginny complimented, combining her hair with her fingers nervously."Thank you," Annie smiled."I wished I looked as pretty as you," Ginny admitted, looking down. Annie frowned and put her hands on Ginny's shoulders."Listen to me, Ginny," Annie said softly. "You're gorgeous. Neville is going to be a lucky lad, going to the Ball with you."Ginny mumbled something about Harry and feeling like a little child."If Harry's to blind to see what's right in front of him, then he's an idiot. Same goes about Ron," She added, looking over to Hermione, who blushed slightly."Boys at your age are idiots. Hell, all boys are idiots! But when they're that age, they have an excuse. Because, all the girls around them are suddenly maturing and they're not. It's just over whelming for them. Give it a few years and the boys, especially Harry, will be throwing themselves at your feet."Ginny smiled brightly, as did Hermione. Annie grinned widely."Now, come one girls! We have a ball to get to, and I don't want you to miss it. Merlin, I feel like a fairy godmother!"The girls laughed and made their way out of the Gryffindor Girls dormitories. Annie felt a little guilty, she was, in a way, betraying her house. She'd only ever been in the Hufflepuff Common Room before. But she had to admit, she defiantly preferred the Hufflepuff Common Room. It just seemed more homely and warm than the exposed Gryffindor Tower.Ginny and Annie lead the way, with Hermione lingering slightly. Annie kept looking back and smiling at her reassuringly. The poor girl looked terrified at the prospect of going to the Ball with Viktor Krum. Only Annie and Ginny knew and both of them had been sworn to secrecy.Annie finally felt what it was like to have a sibling. And better yet, two younger sisters. Growing up, she was lonely and longed for the comfort of a sibling, especially during school times when the bullies used to gang up on her.When Annie and Ginny arrived in the Entrance Hall â€“ Hermione was still lingering â€“ Professor McGonagall swooped down."Miss Weasley, please will you head into the Great Hall?" She asked. Ginny nodded and, after shooting Annie an encouraging smile. Professor McGonagall turned to face Annie. "Miss Ainsworth!""Professor McGonagall," Annie smiled. "Where would you like me?""Just in the Hall, dear. Now, where was I?" The Professor muttered before turning away and bustling some students into the Hall.Annie just smiled and made her way through the ever thinning crowd of students. She sent Harry a wide grin, and waved as she passed. Harry returned the wave, but his smile faltered slightly. Annie's eyes flickered towards Pavarti Patil, who stood next to Harry. Neither one of them looked that happy about who they were going to the Ball with.Cedric also smiled at Annie as she passed. He was there with Cho Chang, the pretty girl off the train. However, unlike Harry, he seemed more confident and relaxed. He looked so grown up, in his neatly pressed dress robes, Annie had difficulty believing it was the same scrawny eleven year old boy she used to tutor.When she entered the Hall, Annie gasped slightly, overwhelmed at the beauty of the Hall. It had completely changed, clearly decorated to impress the guest schools. She didn't recognise a lot of people, all the girls were dolled up, wearing so much makeup.The champions all entered the Hall, Hermione looking particularly stunning, and began to dance. Harry looked very uncomfortable, Pavarti was leading the dance. Others began to dance too, Dumbledore led Madam Maxine in to a waltz, receiving slightly jealous looks from Hagrid.Annie felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned round."Want to dance?" Charlie Weasley grinned."Charlie! You look nice," Annie smiled, her eyes studying Charlie's appearance.He was dressed in simple black dress robes, with a red tie. His hair was neatly combed and he stood tall, but grinned goofily at the same time."Thanks. You lookâ€¦well, stunning."Annie blushed slightly."Thanks, did you say you wanted to dance?"Charlie nodded, and held out his hand like a gentleman. Annie giggled slightly, and he led her to the brightly lit dance floor.Annie placed her hand on his shoulder, Charlie's hand went to Annie's waist and he began to lead. He held her close, perhaps a little too close for being 'just friends' but for some reason, Annie didn't care. For the first time in a long while, she was having fun. She was happy.Please review!

Only two reviews? Come on, there was four on one chapter! So, another update. That last chapter was sweet, wasn't it? Think of it as...the calm before the storm. *Grins evil* Oh, yeah, you don't know what I'm on about. You will...soon. I also have a feeling that people will be after by head at the end of this chapter, especially since probably won't be able to update till Thursday. Anyway, red, review and try not to kill me!You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen - Paulo Coelho25th December 1994 Part 2As Charlie spun Annie round the dance floor, he studied her. This was the most beautiful he had ever seen her. But then again, Annie always looked beautiful. She looked younger too, relaxed and happy. Her chocolate brown eyes seemed to sparkle with life and happiness. He lifted her up, watching as her silky dress swished around her shoulders."Is Percy here?" Annie asked, breaking him from his thoughts."Yeah. Mr Crouch was ill so Percy's filling in for him," Charlie explained. Annie nodded and shuddered, which surprised Charlie."Good. There's something about Mr Crouch. He just seems kind ofâ€¦off. And when Dumbledore introduced me to him, I swear, he looked like he had just seen a ghost."Charlie raised an eyebrow at the expression."Oh, it's a muggle saying. Most muggles don't believe in ghosts."Charlie nodded, understanding the phrase more. He spun Annie round again and looked over her shoulder towards where Ginny was dancing. Annie must have saw his over protective look and laughed slightly."Quit going into big brother mode. Ginny already has the twins and Ron looking out for her constantly, she doesn't need you and Percy too," Annie said, motioning towards where Percy stood, looking warily at Neville."I can't help it. It's just built in," Charlie said."Yeah, well, Neville doesn't exactly look like the type to be hurting your sister. The poor boy looks terrified just dancing with her!"Both Annie and Charlie looked over to Ginny and Neville, just when Neville accidentally stood on Ginny's foot. The older two just smiled as Neville quickly apologised to Ginny, over and over again."And anyway," Annie said, turning back to Charlie. "Ginny is perfectly capable of looking after herself.""How do you know?" Charlie asked, curiously."Because, I'm a girl. Knowing how to get back at a boy is built in," She said, oh-so-innocently.Charlie felt slightly scared at that. His mind flashed back to the riot at the World Cup. He had been amazed at how good Annie was at duelling. It crossed his mind not to get onto Annie's bad side.As the couple waltzed away, Charlie looked over to where Mad-Eye Moody was sitting, drinking from his hip flask."Mad-Eye's a bit creepy, don't you think?" Charlie said. Annie's gaze fell upon Mad-Eye too."Eccentric, maybe. But not necessarily creepy," She replied. "Actually, I think he's starting to lose it a bit.""How so?""I don't know," Annie said, before pondering for a minute. "He just seemsâ€¦different. Like when I spoke to him about Tonks, he acted as if he had never heard of her.""Weird," Charlie agreed. He watched as Mad-Eye's electric blue eye fell upon Charlie, before quickly whizzing towards Annie. It lingered on her for a minute, before zooming to where Charlie's hand lay on her waist. His face reddened in realisation on how far down it was, and decided it was time to change the conversation."How about a drink? We could go outside too, it's too warm in here," He asked, hoping she would say yes."Ok, let's go."Charlie's muscles relaxed as he led Annie, first to the drinks table, then out of the Hall. Outside, an artificial garden had been built, decorated with fairy lights and large stone statues. On their way out, Charlie received exactly four knowing glances of people. One each from the twins, one from Percy, and one from, strangely enough, from Dumbledore.A patio with a balcony that overlooked the grounds had been constructed, with rose bushes all around. Charlie stopped and sipped his drink, Annie doing the same. They stood there, in silence, looking over the grounds."Remember," Charlie said softly. "That Quidditch game back in fifth year?""Yeah, the one when you knocked me off my broom?" Annie teased, causing Charlie to blush slightly."Yeah, I honestly thought you would kill me afterwards.""Mhe, Tonks was ready to kill you. And I think your mum was too. I can still remember your face at that howler. I think that was the scariest I've ever seen you."They both laughed slightly at the memory. Charlie was beginning to relax, it just felt so right being here next to Annie."Annie?" He asked, looking down at her small figure.Annie turned and looked up at him, eyes wide and soft. Merlin, she was perfect. Up close, Charlie could see every detail of her face; the small scar above her eye brow, the slight blush of her cheeks, the pale but healthy looking colour of her skin. Every angelic feature."Yes?" She asked, in her heavenly voice. Her lips, a pretty red colour from the lipstick she was wearing just seemed so plump and full.He couldn't help himself. Joints acting of their own accord, he leaned down and kissed her.Boomshell. Boom. Please review!

I'm back! This chapter has special thanks to MelodyPond77 who is now by beta! (Although I didn't know what one was before it was mentioned). So, read, enjoy and please review!Life is a canvas of many strokes where shades from different palettes meet into a picture so concrete that some forget it is their own, so become framed themselves - Vanna Bonta25th December 1994 Part 3The kiss, it was so different to the way Chris kissed her. With Chris, it was always hurried, rush, and empty. No emotion or passion. Formal. Lifeless. Ardor-less. Cold. Chris's kisses were just empty and lacking.But this kiss was completely different. The complete opposite to the way Chris kissed. This kiss was full of passion, in the heat of the moment. So full of life. The warmness of Charlie's lips filled her whole body. It felt like sparks were actually flying. Safe, but dangerous at the same time. Gentle.It felt so right. Yet, so wrong.What felt like years passed before Annie realized what she was doing. Her eyes widened in shock and she pushed away, looking up at Charlie. His eyes were shocked, too, but fulfilled at the same time."Annieâ€¦" He began, moving to embrace her. Annie pushed his arms back."No," She whispered. "No! This isn't right!" She exclaimed this time. "I can't do this."Then Annie did the only thing she could do at that minute. It was cowardly, yes, but it was the only way out. She ran."Annie!" She heard Charlie's strangled cry from behind but chose to ignore it. A tear fell down her face but she brushed it away hastily. She couldn't be caught crying over some teenage drama. She was stronger than this.It was Annie's biggest guilt that, when face in times of personal drama, she ran. Not because she was scared, but because of all the conflicting emotions in her head. They confused her, causing her to act drastically and often in the worst possible way.There were only three other times in her life when Annie ran from her problems.The first time was when her parents told her that her mother was ill. Annie had been seven years old at the time and had been so confused at the matter, she ran out into the back garden, climbed the biggest tree she could find, and sat and cried all afternoon. It was also the first time she met a fireman, who had been called when Annie realized she couldn't get down.The second time was when she had just turned eleven. After being told she was a witch, her emotions were all over the place. And when she saw her dad talking to a pretty woman, she'd lost it, convinced her dad was replacing both Annie and her mother. It later transpired that the woman was going to start working in the restaurant, making Annie feel like a complete idiot.The third, and most recent time, was when her dad had told her that the restaurant might be closing. She was in tears at the idea of the restaurant, her home, that both her parents had put so much money and work and love into could be closing. It felt like part of her mother was being ripped from her, and Annie couldn't do anything. So she ran. But after a few cups of tea, a lot of tears and a giant bear hug from her father, she calmed down. After that, she threw herself into helping to get the restaurant back onto its feet.Maybe that was why she wasn't a Gryffindor.But this time, when she ran, she realized she was just making it worse. She would still have to look Chris in the eye and basically tell him that she'd snogged another bloke. She was not looking forward to that conversation.And as for Charlieâ€¦ Rage built up through her. How dare he? Kiss her when she least expected it. She wasn't some object that he owned. She was a human being with feelings! A human being who was in a relationship, for Merlin's sake!Somehow, she managed to make it to her room without running into anyone. Thank god, Annie didn't think she could deal with the shame of one of the students seeing her crying. Because by now, she was in full on tears.Why, why was she crying? She shouldn't be the one crying, Charlie should be. When she gave him a good sock in the jaw.Oh, god, what would she tell Chris? She had basically cheated on him!What made it even worse is that a small part of Annie actually liked kissing Charlie. It was completely different to kissing Chris, wild and unexpected and dangerous. That is what made Annie feel bad. She liked it.Too many emotions were running through Annie's head so she flopped down on her bed in exasperation. What was she going to do? The way Annie saw it, she had three options.One. Tell Chris and probably break up.Two. Pretend like it never happened.Three. Completely ignore Charlie for the rest of her life, pretend like it never happened and hope that Chris would never find out.(Although, in hindsight, option two and three were basically the same).Right now, option three was the most likely. Hopefully, Chris would never find out. After all, only Annie and Charlie knew about the kiss. Avoiding Charlie would be harder, but she would only have to avoid him until July, or whenever he was going back to Romania.Yeah, she could do it. Act as if nothing had ever happened. After all, she was good at that.Please review!

So, back again. Second update this weekend, aren't you lucky? Hope you all like this one, I thought it was really quite interesting to write. Read and review!You can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, you will - Stephen King28th January 1995Annie looked into the full length mirror and grimaced slightly. She really didn't suit this dress. The colour, the cut, the style, everything. It just wasn't her. Ok, maybe the style was alright, but the colour of the dress just really didn't suit Annie. A pastel, snot green colour. But, it was what Chris had asked her to wear, so it would have to do. Annie's hair was down in its natural curls, and she had put a bit of make up on. However, when she reached to put on her gold heels, guilt ran through her.The kiss with Charlie had been a mistake, she told herself. She was with Chris. She was happy. Ever since the Yule Ball, she had avoided Charlie. Just a day after the kiss, he had come knocking on her door, pleading to talk to her. She ignored him, focusing on her book. He had waited outside for nearly an hour, probably thinking she was out and he would be able to catch her.The knock on her bedroom door snapped her from her thoughts."Annie, are you ready?" The mumbled voice of Chris asked through the wood of the door."Yeah, two minutes," Annie called back.After the whole Yule Ball incident, Annie had taken to flooing in to work every day, spending more time in the flat. Chris was happy at the prospect of spending more time with Annie, which only made her feel even guiltier. Chris was still working his fingers to the bone at work, often not coming home till late at night. But it was nice of him to organise this date, although Annie had no idea what the occasion was."You look nice," Chris smiled, quickly kissing her on the cheek."Thanks," Annie said, forcing a strained smiled. Her mother used to say that if a boy told her she looked 'nice', he was probably brain damaged."Shall we get going?" He asked, and Annie nodded.They apparated to Hogsmeade, and Chris led her into the Three Broomsticks, to the small table in the corner he had reserved. They ordered, made small talk concerning work and other matters. It was all rather boring in Annie's opinion; they did this most nights over dinner.When Chris was going off on a tangent about his probable upcoming promotion, Annie's mind drifted towards the events of the past month. She hadn't told Tonks about the kiss; Annie didn't want to distract Tonks from her upcoming Auror exams. Tonks was clumsy enough without having that on her mind.There was also the issue of Charlie. So far, she had managed to avoid him successfully, but the matter of his siblings were another thing. Annie had a pretty good guess that Charlie would have told Bill, but Bill was in Egypt, so what could he do? She highly doubted that Charlie would have told the twins, they would probably never let him forget it. Ron wasn't an issue either; Charlie saw him as his baby brother so probably wouldn't tell him. The same went for Ginny.Here is what Annie knew. Only two, possibly three people knew about the kiss. Charlie, possibly Bill, and Annie herself. Why Charlie kissed her, was a complete mystery to Annie. It wasn't like he fancied her or anything. He'dâ€¦He'd probably had a bit too much to drink, that's all. And it wasn't like Annie enjoyed it. It was different to kissing Chris, but that didn't necessarily mean she liked it. Or did she? No, no she didn't. She didn't fancy Charlie Weasley."Annie? Are you listening?" Chris's voice snapped Annie out of her thoughts."Hmm? What were you saying?""You look tired. Do you want to head back?" Chris asked."Would you mind? It's just I'm really tired after work and-""Annie," Chris cut her off. "Seriously, it's fine."Annie relaxed."Thanks Chris," She smiled."It's fine. Come on, let's go."They paid for their meal, and began to walk down Hogsmeade High Street."Why are we going this way?" Annie asked, looking puzzled."Just, come on. I want to show you something," Chris persisted. Annie thought it best if she kept quiet. She held Chris's hand as he led her down the snowy Hogsmeade Street. At the end of the street, just outside of Honeydukes, he stopped and turned to face her."Annie," He said softly. "This is where we went on our first date."Annie smiled."Yeah, you bought me chocolate cauldrons and then asked me to be your girlfriend.""It seemed right that I tell you here," He said, taking her hand. "Annie, I've been offered a job.""Really? That's great!""Yeah, yeah it is. That's the problem.""What? Why? Chris, what are you on about?"Chris sighed and took a deep breath."Annie, the job is in Hong Kong."All Annie's thoughts stopped for a minute. After a pause, she said;"Oh.""Which is why I wanted to do this," Chris said, letting go off her hand."Annie, we've been together for nearly six years and lived together for four of them. I really love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you," Chris said.Annie stood there, looking slightly shocked."Which is why," Chris continued. "I want to ask you this."His hand went into his pocket, and he fished out a small box. He dropped to his knee, and looked up to Annie, whose face was slightly shocked.No, no, no! Annie thought. Say something else!"Annie, I love-," Chris said, still kneeling in the snow.Say you love something else! Dogs, work, anything!"-you. Will you marry me?"Annie was speechless. There it was. The question. Annie's eyes were wide and her mouth hung open slightly. She tried to speak, her moth moving but no words coming out. Speak! Her mind screamed at her. You look like an idiot!

Bombshell! Last update until Friday. Hope you enjoy this chapter, it was fun to write Annie blowing up at Chris after the way he's treated her. Anyway, enjoy and please review! P.S. Longest chapter yet. Just saying...Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen  - Winston Churchill28th January 1995So far, 1995 was not going well for Charlie Weasley. After the kiss at the Yule Ball, Annie was purposely avoiding Charlie. Who could blame her? Charlie thought. I mean, I basically kissed her with no warning, when she was thinking we were just friends! I've probably scared her have to death! Not to mention the guilt she must be feelingâ€¦Charlie knew that the guilt of having him kiss her must be eating her up from the inside. Annie was just one of those people, who took everything too seriously. One of the reasons he loved herâ€¦.No. Stop thinking like that. Charlie thought. She's with Chris. She's happy. That's all we could ever want for her.Contrary to popular believe, Charlie had not told Bill about kissing Annie. Charlie could already see how that letter would go.Dear Charlie, my enormous prat of a brother.Charlie decided it would be better to keep it to himself. That way, Annie wouldn't get hurt.Charlie sat in the corner of Hog's Head, drinking a glass of Firewhiskey by himself. Why was he not in the Three Broomsticks, you may ask? Simple answer. He had saw Chris leading Annie in there, about an hour ago. Probably for some coupley-date thing. Merlin, Charlie thought. Listen to me! I sound like some hormonal teenager! I'm twenty two years old!Sighing, he downed the rest of his drink in seconds and shrugged his jacket on. After a quick nod towards Aberforth, who was cleaning glasses with a dirty rag, Charlie headed out. He walked down the back alleys of Hogsmeade as he was less likely to see anyone. Or so he thought."Annie, I've been offered a job." The unmistakable voice of Chris Redmayne echoed down the alley.Oh great, Charlie thought. Just what I need right now. The happy couple in all their greatest. Featuring the woman I love and the world's biggest prat."That's great!" Annie's musical voice caused Charlie's heart to flutter slightly, but he quickly calmed down."Yeah, yeah it is. That's the problem.""What? Why? Chris, what are you on about?"There was a pregnant pause before Chris continued."Annie, the job's in Hong Kong."No. Charlie thought. Annie can't move to China! She just can't!"Which is why I wanted to do this," Chris said. Charlie could vaguely see Chris let go of Annie's hand and his hand went to his pocket.Oh no. No, no, no! He can't! He can't ask Annie to marry him!"Annie, we've been together for nearly six years and lived together for four of them. I really love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you," Chris said. "Which is why, I want to ask you this."Chris got down on one knee and Charlie sucked in a sharp breath."Annie, I love you. Will you marry me?"This was it. Charlie would lose Annie forever. Now, she would never be with him. Charlie's head bowed in sadness. The one girl he had ever truly loved would now be moving to China with Charlie's worst enemy."No," Annie's surprise response caused Charlie's head to snap up quickly."W-What?" Chris stammered, obviously not expecting rejection."I said no. I'm sorry Chris, but I can't marry you," Annie's voice was strained but slightly determined. She turned away from Chris, and Charlie could no longer see her face."You can't say no to me! We've been together for six years!" Chris exclaimed, angry edge to his voice."I just did.""Why? Why can't you marry me?" Chris snarled.Annie turned round, eyes slightly blazing. Both Chris and Charlie shrank back slightly, scared of the clearly annoyed Hufflepuff."Why? You want to know why I can't marry you?" Annie questioned. "Chris, this is the first time in weeks- no years! - that I've seen you for more than an hour a day!""That's not true-" Chris began, but Annie quickly cut him off."Yes it is!" Annie half shrieked. Charlie was vaguely reminded of his mother, when she would go ballistic on him and his siblings."I've been busy at work!" Charlie protested."Too busy to miss dinner?" Annie shot back. "Too busy come home for New Year? Too busy to celebrate our own anniversary?"This shocked Charlie. Chris really didn't deserve Annie. He edged closer, to get a better look. Annie was standing in the middle of the empty street in a not so nice green dress. Chris stood a little away from her, looking very angry and like he'd just been punched in the gut."But you're my girlfriend!" Chris shouted."No," Annie said, shaking her head. "Not anymore. I don't even think you love me. Not for a long time.""This is because of him, isn't it?" Chris questioned furiously. "Charlie Weasley?!"Charlie's head whipped round when he heard his name. Surely, Chris didn't know about the kiss? He heard Annie scoff."What has Charlie Weasley got to do with any of this?" She demanded."Oh don't play the innocent to me! I know you fancied him in school! The whole bloody school knew!""Don't be absurd! There is nothing going on between me and Charlie Weasley!"A piece of said boy's heart broke slightly when he heard Annie say this."But why then?!" Chris shouted. "Why can't you marry me?""Because," Annie said, her voice lowering down to its usual tone. "You're just not the one for me. When you meet the one, you just know."Charlie's heart recovered slightly. He knew Annie was the one. He had the same feeling when he first met her."You know what you are?" Chris growled. "An ungrateful bitch! After all I've done for you!"Charlie saw Annie's face tense, and she clenched her hands tightly. Charlie hoped, for Chris's sake, that he would have the sense to shut up soon. Unfortunately for Chris, he didn't."You think you're so great, playing the part of little Annie, the girl who grew up without a Mam." Chris was now yelling. "You're a Mudblood! And nothing better! You're never going to-""LOCOMOTOR WIBBLY!" Annie cried, pointing her wand towards Chris.Chris collapsed onto the ground, legs shaking. His hair was now messed up and he was covered in snow."I want you out of the flat tonight," Annie said quietly, turning on her heel.Chris began to shout at her, calling her names that if Charlie's mum was to hear, Mrs Weasley would whack him with her broomstick."Silencio," Annie muttered, causing Chris to be silenced, but his mouth was still moving in an angry frown. "They say opposites attract. I hope you meet somebody who is attractive, intelligent, and cultured," She retorted, before apparating away.Charlie saw Chris perform the counter-curse and he began to stomp off to the Three Broomsticks.No one insults Annie like that, Charlie thought following him up the street. He was going to enjoy this. It's time Chris felt what it was like to be punched in the gut.Please review!

Back again, for the first time this weekend! Hope everyone liked that last chapter. Finally, Annie is free from Chris! But will she choose Charlie? Anyway, I had fun writing this chapter so I hope everyone likes it. Enjoy and review!The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity - Walt Whitman29th January 1995Dear Nymph,I don't really know how to say this. Oh, Merlin, it's all happened so fast. So I'll just say it.What the hell am I doing? It would be so much easier to explain all this in person. Meet meHow can it be so hard to right a damn letter? I won't sugar coat it, I'll be blunt.No, no, no! I can't explain it! It just happened and I didn't know what to do! I know you'll be mad, me not telling you, even though you're my best mate.Oh, god, what will my Dad say?Nymph, I've come to the conclusion that I am a horrible person. Really, I am.Charlie kissed me. Chris proposed. I said no. Broke up.-Annie29th January 1995Dear Annie,What?! I mean what?! You kissed Charlie?! First off, about time! Don't hate me for saying that, but I'm pretty sure everyone in our year at school betted on you two getting together.Secondly, wow. Just wow. I mean, I knew you two have had been together, but still. Did not expect that. Honestly didn't think he had it in him. How did it happen?Thirdly, I think you're better off without him. He was a bit of a prat and didn't treat you properly. I can hex him to Hong Kong if you want me to!Finally, what's going to happen now? I mean, are you with Charlie or what? (Please don't be mad, but I kinda bet that you two would get together).Write back soon!-TonksPS. How was the kiss with Charlie? Did you enjoy it? Don't roll your eyes at me, I want details!29th January 1995Dear Tonks,Really? How was it? And you bet money on me?Ok, not the best start to a letter, I know. But seriously?Well, the kiss happened at the Yule Ball. Before you start ranting about how I didn't tell you, just remember, you had your Auror exams, and I didn't want to distract you. That, and I was really confused at what happened. And I felt so angry at myself, I just wanted to forget about it.It happened in Hogsmeade. Chris wanted to go out for a meal in the Three Broomsticks and when he was walking me back up to the Castle, he asked.Nice of you to offer, but someone already beat you to it. Hagrid told me that yesterday when he was in the Three Broomsticks, after I left, Chris came in with a black eye and a broken nose. He wouldn't say who did it to him, but whoever it was, I'm grateful! Karma's a bitch!Anyway, Chris had been offered a job in, ironically enough, Hong Kong. Quit your laughing, I'm not making it up. Anyway, he wanted me to go with him. But I couldn't. It was bad enough having all these conflicted feelings about Charlie without having that on my plate.And, you see, Chris didn't take it too well. When I say that, I mean, he was really angry. Like really. He started shouting at me, calling me all sorts of things. In the end, I might have, well, cast jelly-legs on him.Hope that answers your questions,-Annie30th January 1995To Charlie Weasley,I know you were the one who gave Chris Redmayne a black eye and a broken nose. Thank you, he was horrible for Annie. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.-TonksP.S. It was about time someone gave him a good sock in the jaw.30th January 1995Dear Bill,Bill, I'm in the middle of a bloody meltdown! Before you say 'stop acting like a little girl', there are some things I would like to say.One. I kissed Annie. Yes, that's good and all but not when it's in the middle of the Yule Ball. I couldn't help it! It was her reaction that was the worst though. At first, she didn't pull away. So, I thought I might stand a chance, you know? Then, she quickly stopped and seemed really upset and said 'I can't do this' and ran off! I haven't spoken to her since because she's been avoiding me.Second. Chris proposed to her. And she said no. Am I being too hopeful to think that it was because she has feelings for me? Oh, who am I kidding?Third. I may have beat up Chris after Annie said no. But it wasn't my fault! He was spouting of rubbish about her, calling her terrible things. So, I might have broken Chris's nose and given him a black eye. What can I say? Karma's a bitch!So, I just really need some of that brotherly advice on what to do. Do I talk to her? Because I think she may be mad at me after the whole kiss.- CharlieP.S. Tonks knows that I was the one who beat up Chris. She sent me a congratulatory card and said it was about time.31st January 1995Dear Tonks,You have to come see my new flat! It's way bigger than my old one! Seriously, come round. Do you want to come round for tea on Saturday? I'll cook, we both know you and kitchen appliances do not mix. Say, five-ish? And yes, we can go out for a drink afterwards, rummy!But my new flat, it's just great. It feels so good to be away from the old one. Honestly, it felt a bit like a prison. But a nice one. And, although a teenage me would kill me for saying this, it feels good to be away from Chris. He was very â€“ what's the word I'm looking for? - controlling? Egocentric? Or just plain prat-ish?I can't believe I didn't see it before. And don't you go saying 'I told you so'.Oh! Good news! You are now reading a letter from a proud owner of a cat. Shocking, isn't it? A witch with a cat. Ha Ha. Oh, wait, wizards don't get the whole cat-witch relationship. Never mind.So anyway, my cat. Auntie Arabella â€“ you know, my Mum's adopted mum? The one with the slight over fascination with cats? â€“ decided that as a late Christmas present (really late, like what? Forty days late? Well, she can be a bit batty, but what are families like?) She would give me one of the half a dozen cats she currently had living in her house. Dad says she sells them or something. Apparently, she makes quite a bit off it!As I write, my new, six month old, tortoiseshell cat is roaming round my new flat! His name's Jasper and he is sooo cute! Although, when you wake up at six in the morning to his furry backside in your face, he does seem less cute.Canaries and other small birds of the wizarding world, watch out because Jasper the cat is on the prowl!Oh, god, I'm going to turn in to a crazy cat lady, aren't I?!Oh, well. You could be one too!How'd the exams go? Tell me all about them!So, I'll see you on Saturday. I won't take no for an answer!Love, Annie.P.S. Currently staying at Hogwarts though the week again. Just in case you decide you want to go to Hogsmeade or something.P.P.S sorry for any paw marks on the parchment. Jasper isn't exactly house trained yet.Please review!

...Hey people. I'm SOO sorry about the delay in updates. I've just been on holiday and had tonnes of homework to do. And, the exams are coming. Lucky me. Anyway, yeahy! New update! A lot of positive feedback for that last one. I hope you all enjoy this one just as much! Please read and review!In times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive- Lee Iacocca 1st February 1995Annie huffed as she stood outside the closed door. Tonks had invited her round 'to chat', as she put it. In other words, to try and get all the details about the weekend previous. Annie's fingers tapped against the sleeve of her usual brown leather jacket. This was the first time she'd seen Tonks since she'd broken up with Chris. Not to mention the whole 'kissing Charlie' incident. After what seemed like years, the red coloured, wooden door swung open, revealing Tonks, complete with her usual bubble-gum pink hair. She was grinning widely, if not slightly manically."Annie!" She said loudly. "It's great that you're here!""It's good to see you too, Tonks," Annie said, slightly wearily. She'd been at work the night before and was absolutely knackered."Come on, Annie!" Tonks cried. "Smile!""Easy for you to say," Annie said. "You've got too much energy for-" Annie stopped to check her watch. "Half nine in the morning."Tonks simply grinned. "Yeah, well, I may have already had a few too many cups of coffee!"Annie laughed and shook her head. The only thing worse than a drunk Tonks was a sugar-crazed, hyped-up Tonks. Annie remembered the time when they were at school, having just been to Hogsmeade for the first time and winning the previous day's Quidditch match. Tonks had went crackers at the sight of Honeydukes, buying literally half the shop. The after effects was something Annie did not want to see again anytime soon."Okay then. Why did you want me to meet you at your parents' house? Why not your flat?" Annie asked. Tonks grinned mischievously."You'll see. Come on, follow me!" She sang, leading Annie through the hallway. They went through the living room and Annie saw Tonks' parents sitting in their armchairs, sipping their cups of tea."Hello, Mr and Mrs Tonks!" Annie called as she walked into the room. The two looked up and smiled politely."Good morning, Annie. How are you?" Mrs Tonks asked."Fine, thank you," Annie replied."Annie! How many times do I have to tell you? It's Ted and Andromeda! Dora always calls your father by his first name," Mr Tonks grinned.Annie smiled."But it's just polite to call you by your surname!" She insisted."Does Dora here call your Dad by his first name?" Mr Tonks said, eyebrow raised. Annie was silent and he just laughed. "Thought so. It's Ted and Andromeda, Annie.""Okay then," Annie replied to Mr Tonks - no, Ted. Tonks appeared next to Annie from the other room, carrying a beater's bat and an empty wicker basket."Come on, Annie! We've got so much to do!" Tonks exclaimed, grabbing Annie's wrist and dragging her out of the room. Annie barely had time to wave her hand goodbye before exiting the living room, going through the kitchen and out the backdoor.The Tonks house' back garden stood the same as it had done since the first time Annie ever visited Tonks' house, all the way back in first year. A large, enclosed field surrounded by trees, with a large, old oak tree right at the end of the garden. The tree house which Tonks and Annie had built the first summer Annie came round was still intact in the tree, only slightly grown over.Tonks let go of Annie's wrist, jumped over the low stone wall and beckoned for Annie to follow. Annie rolled her eyes playfully but followed the pink haired girl never the less. The two girls walked for a little while longer, through the vast fields that belonged to Tonks' family. Tonks began to slow down as they neared a cluster of trees. Finally, Tonks stopped in front of a large apple tree in the middle of the cluster of the trees."Right then, perfect!" Tonks declared, setting down the bat and basket."Why are we here, Tonks?" Annie sighed, her arms folded across her chest."Oh, relax! I promise, by the end of the day, you will feel so relieved and stress free!" Tonks proclaimed.Annie sighed and sat on the grass, bringing her legs up to her chest and resting her head on her knees. Yes, she was stressed. Yes, she was upset. Yes, she did feel like the biggest bitch in the world. Did she miss Chris? Yes, in a way she did. Did she feel guilty about kissing Charlie? Definitely. Did she enjoy it? Without a doubt, yes.In a mist of all her conflicting thoughts and feelings, Annie was vaguely aware of Tonks sitting down next to her, her arm going over Annie's neck, rubbing her arm soothingly."It's ok, you know?" Tonks said, breaking the silence. "I get it. You think you should be missing Chris more than you are. You're feeling guilty about kissing Charlie because you think you've hurt his feelings, but you're scared about what will happen. Work is getting to you and you're stressed. You're pissed off at both Charlie and Chris because of the way they've treated you. I get it!"Annie lifted her head and turned to face her best friend of ten years. Tonks face was full of understanding, kindness, loyalty, love. Annie sniffed, suddenly aware that tears were prickling down her face. Tonks smiled reassuringly and handed her a hankie."Come on, dry up," She said soothingly. "Luckily for you, because I'm just a great friend, I have the best method of coping.""What's that?""That, my dear friend Annie, is why we're out here," Tonks replied, getting up. Annie did the same, brushing the dirt off of her jeans. "You see, when I was a little girl, unable to do magic, I came up with this excellent method of stress relief. Mostly when I wasn't picked for the kiddie's Quidditch team, but it can be applied to your situation."Tonks whipped out her wand, and gave it a wave, causing two dozen apples on the tree to fly down from their branches and land neatly in the basket. She then picked up the beater's bat and held it out for Annie to take."What's this for?" Annie asked curiously, taking the bat. "I play seeker, not beater.""I know, but it's part of the stress relief," Tonks explained. "Alright, go stand over there." She pointed towards a clump of trees, about twenty meters from where they were standing. Eyebrow raised, Annie did as Tonks said."Alright then, now what?" Annie called from her new spot.Tonks picked up an apple from the basket."Are you ready?" She shouted."Ready for what?""Hit the apple!" Tonks shouted, readying herself to throw."What?!""Just hit it!"As the words left Tonks' mouth, the apple left her hand and hurdled towards Annie. It all happened in a flash. One moment, it was the apple, and the next, Annie saw Chris' face. With all the strength, she had, Annie swung the apple, which hit the bat with a loud thwack! It landed quite far away but Annie didn't stop to look where because the next apple was coming towards her. This time, it was Charlie's face.The two repeated this process for a good half hour, until there were only two apples left in the basket. At this point, Annie put her hand up to stop, walked back and picked up the second to last apple. She took a large bit out of it and flopped to the ground, Tonks doing the same."I'll admit, that was a pretty good way of stress relief," Annie said."Annie, Annie, Annie. When are you going to understand that I am simply a genius in disguise?"Please review!

...Hey, my great readers. I am so sorry about the delay in chapter postings. But, in my defence, really? Only the one review? We had seven for one chapter! Was it really that bad? Anyway, hope you all enjoy this one. And remember, review!Help others achieve their dreams and you will achieve yours - Les Brown23rd February 1995"Annie!" Cedric's voice carried across the busy corridor. Annie stopped and turned to face the boy as he came running up towards her, nearly knocking over some first years in the process."Yeah, Ced?" Annie smiled. "What is it?""Can I have a word? It's really important.""Sure. Do you want to talk to me here?"Cedric looked round cautiously, eyeing a few Durmstrang students who were walking past."Could we talk somewhere else? It's kinda private."Annie nodded, although she was slightly confused. The two walked into an empty classroom, Cedric walking in last and looking over his shoulder before he closed the door."So then? What's so important you couldn't tell me out there?" Annie asked, arms folded."It's about the Second Task," Cedric blurted out. "I worked out what the clue is. The task's going to be in the lake!"Annie raised an eyebrow."That's great! But why do you need to talk to me about it?"Cedric looked down at his hands."I don't know what to do."Annie sighed and sat next to him, putting her arm around him."Listen to me. You were chosen because the Goblet thought you were most worthy. Just because you've gotten stuck, doesn't mean you can't do it. It's just a bump in the road, that's all."Cedric looked up at her, looking considerably happier."Thanks, Annie. But, would you be able to help me? I've hit a brick wall when it comes to thinking about what to do."Annie was silent for a moment, pondering on what to do."I think..." She said, slowly. "The Bubble Head charm would be best. If you were to transfigure yourself, there's a possibility it wouldn't work properly. Same goes for any plants that help you to breathe underwater. You don't know how long it's going to last for."Cedric grinned widely."Thanks Annie. You're the best."There was a silence between the two, as they sat quietly."How are you doing?" Cedric asked, slowly and sounding a bit unsure. Annie blinked a few times, before quickly replying;"Fine.""If it helps," Cedric said. "I never really liked him. Especially after he gave me a detention for not having my shirt tucked in."Annie pulled away and looking at him, her face confused."What? When did that happen?""Back in second year.""Why didn't you tell me?"Cedric shrugged."You were happy. Didn't want to spoil that."Annie laughed hollowly."Fat lot of good that did. At least he's on the other side of the world now."Cedric nodded and the two fell into silence."Well," Annie said, patting her knees. "We'd best get going. I have kids to take care off and you have a charm to read about."Cedric pretended to groan but Annie just patted his back. After the two said goodbye and went their separate ways, Annie headed back to the Hospital Wing.The rest of the day dragged on. Most of the students who visited the Hospital Wing where only there because of the slight winter colds they had caught. There was one third year who came in from a Care of Magical Creatures Class with burns from a Blast-Ended Skrewt. With the exception of that, Annie's day was surprisingly uneventful. She found herself going to her room early, changing out of her work robes into a woolly jumper and jeans. Summoning a cup of tea, Annie sat on the window seat and looked out over the grounds. They hadn't changed since she had been a student.Getting bored and hungry, Annie got up and headed towards the little kitchenette of her room. With a swish of her wand, the stove was lit and the kettle filled its self to boil. Annie then pointed her wand at her modified wireless, which she had charmed to play muggle music."It's time to try defying gravity," Annie sang along to the music. "I think I'll try defying gravity"She danced around the room gracefully, like a ballerina. Jasper weaved around her feet, meowing at her. Annie laughed and picked him up, holding him in her arms. She twirled round, pretending Jasper was her dance partner."Kiss me goodbye I'm defying gravity, and you won't bring me down!"The knocking at the door startled Annie out of her dance. Slightly dizzy, she put Jasper down, turned down the wireless and walked to the door, hoping no one had heard her. She opened the door and saw a scared looking first year standing there."Healer Ainsworth?" The first year asked meekly."Yes, hello Lara," Annie smiled back, recognising the first year. Lara's eyes grew wide and she shakily thrust a piece of parchment towards Annie."T-This is from Professor McGonagall," She stuttered."Thank you, Lara," Annie replied. Lara managed a smile before hurrying off.Annie opened up the parchment and quickly read the note. It was a summon to Professor McGonagall's office, but why was not included. Sighing, she pulled on her shoes and grabbed her wand, checking her hair in the mirror one last time before leaving, locking the door behind her.Annie's room was not too far from Professor McGonagall's office, just a floor below. The corridors were mostly empty, with the exception of the occasional student hurrying to dinner. When she reached the office door, she knocked on it, waiting for a reply. The muffled voice of the Transfiguration Professor could vaguely be heard on the other side of the door so Annie went in.Professor McGonagall sat in her chair behind the wooden desk, and three other people sat in front of the desk. This surprised Annie because sitting in front of the desk were Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and a young looking girl with silvery blonde hair."Miss Ainsworth, it's good of you to come," Professor McGonagall greeted. "I trust we weren't interrupting anything?""Of course not, Professor," Annie replied."Please, take a seat," Professor McGonagall said, gesturing to the empty chair next to Hermione. Annie smiled and sat door, quickly glancing at Hermione who offered her a reassuring smile."Now then, the Headmaster will be along shortly," Professor McGonagall said. "But first, I think I'd better tell you all why you are here. As part of the Second Task, the four champions will be required to retrieve something that has been stolen from them. Or should I say, someone.'Oh. Now it all made sense to Annie. It also looked like it made sense to Hermione too, who was wearing an expression similar to Annie's. However, Ron and the little girl clearly did not follow as they both sat there with confused expressions. Ron was the first to speak."I'm sorry, what?" He asked."Mr Weasley, Miss Ainsworth, Miss Granger, Miss Delacour and yourself are what the champions will be trying to retrieve. You will be what Mr Potter will trying to retrieve, Miss Delacour for the elder Delacour, Miss Ainsworth for Mr Diggory and Miss Granger for Mr Krum."At the end of Professor McGonagall's explanation, Annie could have sworn she saw Ron scowl at the sentence involving Hermione and Krum. Hermione herself looked a bit surprised, but she quickly concealed it."Professor, aren't I needed to help Madam Pomfrey?" Annie queried."Do not worry, Miss Ainsworth, Madam Pomfrey has insisted that she is capable of taking care of the medical responsibilities," Professor McGonagall ensured. "Now, there is that matter of consent. You do not have to do it if you do not want to. Just remember that."Annie and the others exchanged looks. They mostly looked confident, with the exception of the little girl who looked a little scared. They all nodded and Professor McGonagall continued."You will all be perfectly safe but you will have to take a potion that will put you under an enchanted sleep. When you leave the water, you will wake up. Is everyone still in?"Again, they all nodded."Right then," Annie said. "Let's get this over with."Please review!

In advance, I am really sorry for the really late update. Two months? Didn't realise it had been that long. I've just been so busy! With exams, coursework, family stuff, uni stuff, I just haven't had the time to think about this! This will be the only update for this week (still got loads of coursework to do), but as it's nearly the summer holidays (whoa!) more updates! I also want to say a big thank you to all who have reviewed, especially to Lovewriting12 and GabbiGrl who have both reviewed loads and have both fully supported me writing this story. Thank you! Please, enjoy this chapter. See you next week. Please check out my other stories! Thanks! P.S. sorry about the mistakes, a bit tipsy."...unrequited love does not die; it's only beaten down to a secret place where it hides, curled and wounded. For some unfortunates, it turns bitter and mean, and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before" -Elle Newmark24th February 1995"Come on Charlie! We'll be late!" Fred told his brother from their seats at the Gryffindor table."Yeah! Think of all the money we'll miss out on!" George added."Alright, you two, shove off!" Charlie growled back, clearly annoyed."Sounds like you woke up on the wrong side of the broomstick, Charlie. What's wrong?" Ginny asked, looking at her brother with a slightly worried look. Charlie wasn't the brother that got annoyed over little things so when he did snap, all the Weasley siblings knew something was wrong."I'm fine!" He snapped, getting up from his seat. "Why can't you lot leave me alone?" He said before storming off, leaving three bewildered Weasleys in his wake.Truth was, Charlie was not fine. Far from it, in fact. He was depressed. You see, Annie and pointedly ignored Charlie ever since the Yule Ball (61 days and counting). It was even worse after Annie had broken up with Chris. Did some small part of Charlie believe that Annie had broken up with Chris to be with Charlie? Yes. Did Charlie hope Annie felt the same way about kissing him as he did kissing her? Yes. Was he disappointed that she didn't choose him? Definitely.Merlin, Charlie thought. He sounded like a love-struck teenage girl. And snapping at his siblings wasn't going to help. Speaking of siblings, where was Ron? It was unusual of his younger brother to miss breakfast, especially on a day like today. Charlie thought that Ron would at least be here to support his best friend. After the First task, Ron and Harry had made up and were once again best friends again. Hermione wasn't here either, which was strange as Charlie thought that Ron's bushy haired friend would be here, making sure that Harry was preparing to the very last minute.In his deep thoughts, Charlie didn't see the person rushing round the corner, causing the two to bump into each other."Sorry!" Charlie said, picking himself up off the floor and brushing the dust off of his trousers. He looked down at the other body on the floor. Cedric, dressed in his Hufflepuff robes, stood up."It's alright," He replied. "I wasn't watching where I was going."Charlie nodded, feeling nervous? Awkward? He wasn't sure. It was like he was talking to the enemy."Have you seen Annie anywhere?" Cedric asked, out of the blue."No? Wasn't she in the Great Hall?" Charlie asked, alarm bells beginning to ring."I don't think so. I haven't seen her since yesterday!" Cedric said, clearly distressed. Poor kid, Charlie thought. He's got enough on his plate without worrying about Annie."Look, I'm sure Annie's probably just slept in," Charlie said, lying through his teeth. He, and Cedric probably knew, that is was highly unlikely that Annie had slept in. However, they both wanted to believe it."Yeahâ€¦" Cedric replied, looking down."Good luck for today," Charlie said, although it sounded more like a question. It was just plain weird for Charlie, wishing the opposition luck. Well, Harry's opposition."Thanks," Cedric mumbled, still looking distracted. "I'd better get going."The boy left without another word, leaving a confused Charlie in his wake. Charlie had a lot to think about, his meeting with Cedric had helped to calm his mood slightly. It was just so frustrating!Every time he saw Annie, he just wanted to shout 'I love you!' he wanted to hold her in his arms and tell her that she was his world. Promise her that if she was ever scared, he would be there. Sappy, Charlie knew, but still.Charlie sighed, rubbing his temples with his hands. He pushed the thoughts out of his mind for the time being. He had to go apologise to his younger siblings; he shouldn't have snapped at them. It wasn't their fault that he was being an over-emotional pansy. Sighing again, he made his way back to the Great Hall.The rest the breakfast passed quickly; Charlie apologised to his siblings, all of whom seemed surprisingly alright with his little emotional outburst. He saw Ginny's eyes flicker towards Annie's vacant seat at the staff table but neither said anything.Just after breakfast, Charlie and the rest of the Weasleys (Well, the ones that were there), headed down towards the Black Lake, were the Second Task was being held. Sitting on the platforms that had been conjured around the Black Lake, Charlie scanned through the crowd. As far as he could see, still no Annie.Charlie knew he shouldn't, be he couldn't help but get worried. It wasn't like Annie to be late, especially when a friend needed support. No! He thought. Stop worrying! Annie was a grown woman and could take care of herself."All our champions are ready for the second task," Ludo Bagman's voice rang out. "They have exactly an hour to recover what has been taken from them!"Recover what has been taken from them? What could it be? The gears in Charlie's mind were ticking when suddenly it dawned on him. Both Ron and Annie were missing. Harry and Cedric were friends with them. They were part of the tournamentâ€¦.. Oh Merlin, Charlie thought. He really hoped Annie was a good swimmer.Please review!

Hey! So sorry about this super late update; I've just been so busy! In the two months (Has it really been that long?) since I have last updated, I have been on holiday; got my AS results, passed my theory, got a new job, babysat some kids on my street. went to see the Inbetweeners 2 (so funny!), three friends birthdays and been to a few parties. So, you know, just every day stuff. Anyway, it was my first day back and this past week, instead of doing my coursework like I should have, I wrote a few chapters which was a lot more fun.Okay then, this chapter! I know you have all been looking forward to it, and (hopefully), it won't disappoint. Oh, and I've used a bit French in thsi chapter and forgot what I'd written so go on to google translate to see. Sorry.Just like to add, 50 chapters! Never thought I'd get this far!Please, read, review and enjoy!Speak when you are angry - and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret- Laurence J. Peter24th February 1995It was so strange. Annie knew she was asleep, and yet she couldn't wake up. She felt weird, too. Almost as if she was floating. She felt weightless, like she was a feather in the wind.She was drifting. For the first time in a very long time, Annie felt free. Like she wasn't tied down or being forced to do something she didn't want to.Then came the garbled voices. The most beautiful song Annie had ever heard echoed through her ears. She couldn't make out the words, but it still sounded heavenly. Oh Merlin, she thought, I've died. It was like being in a dream, or a dream of a dream. She was aware of what was happening, but she still couldn't make sense of it.With a sharp pull at her arm, Annie found herself being pulled upwards. Her arms floated up towards, well, Annie didn't know where, but she knew she was going up. She still felt weightless, but knew she was moving.A sudden change in atmosphere drew Annie back into reality. Water crashed around her as she gasped for breath and spluttered as water filled her mouth. A hand grabbed her shoulder and pulled her further up out of the water. Annie's head whipped round like a rabbit's and she saw Cedric, hair wet and sticking to his face, beside her, trying to keep above the water, his hand on Annie's shoulder."Cedric!" Annie gasped, her arms flaying wildly, trying to keep her head above water."Come on!" Cedric said, half shouting as he tried to speak over the volume of the rushing tide. "That way!" His head nodded to Annie's left, where the banks of the Black Lake could be seen.Never once letting go off Annie's hand, Cedric lead her towards the lake's banks, where a vague outline of people could be seen. Over the crash of the waves, Annie could hear the buzz of the crowd, screaming and shouting and cheering. Annie smiled weakly as she heard crowd chant for Cedric, who was grinning widely.They reached the bank side and hands were held out to pull Annie and Cedric on to dry land. Cedric pushed Annie forward, so that she was the first out of the water. Almost immediately, towels were placed around her, and a mug of hot tea was pressed into her hands. She gratefully sipped it, as Cedric, now wrapped in a towel, came over."I'm the first one back!" He exclaimed, grinning widely."That's great!" Annie replied. "Come here."She threw her arms around his neck and hugged him, grinning all the while. Cedric, still grinning, hugged her back, before releasing himself from her grip."I'm going to go and find Cho. Are you okay staying here?" He asked."Yeah, of course," Annie nodded. Cedric gave her one last grin before running off in the direction of a crowd of Ravenclaws. Annie chuckled slightly at Cedric; he was still as full of energy as he was in first year. Tonks had even gave him the name of 'Cedric the Puppy', as he had liked to follow the two older girls round.Annie pulled the towel further round her body, snuggling in to the heat which it gave. Her hair was probably a mess but she didn't care. She was simply too happy to care. A cheer went round the crowd and Annie could vaguely see another Triwizard Champion surface in the water, accompanied by a certain girl which made Annie smile.Hermione, while nervous about her first serious relationship, did like Krum and it was evident that he liked her. Annie, however, could not ignore the possibly jealous looks a certain redhead would shot at the young couple. Even though he would not admit it, Ron clearly liked Hermione and Annie knew this from the looks he had been giving since Hermione had shown an interest in Krum, especially after the Yule Ball.Once she had been fished out of the water, and Krum had went over to his Headmaster â€“ who was commenting on Krum's victory at the top of his voice â€“ Hermione made her way over to Annie, shivering all the while. Annie picked up on this and her healer side of her kicked in, immediately grabbing a towel and draping it over Hermione's shoulders."You're freezing!" Annie exclaimed, grabbing as many towels as she could. "Soaked to the bone! Here, I'll see if I can get you some tea or something hot to drinkâ€¦.""Annie!" Hermione cut across Annie's fussing. "You're soaked to the bone too and you have just given me your own towel!"Annie stopped and looked at Hermione for a minute, before both girls burst out laughing."Oh, I'm sometimes so absent minded," Annie smiled. "But we do need to get you warmed up. You don't want to be catching a cold.""Neither do you," The younger girl pointed out. Annie shook her head and steered Hermione over towards the medical point, where Madam Pomfrey was waiting with towels, bathrobes, and a big pot of tea which Annie was extremely thankful for. The two girls then stood and watched the Black Lake, waiting for Harry to emerge."What's taking him so long?" Hermione asked. "You don't think he's hurt, do you? Oh, what if he is?""Hermione," Annie interrupted, causing the younger girl's head to snap up at Annie. "Harry has took on a fully grown Hungary Horntail, You-know-Who, a couple dementors and a giant Basilisk. I'm pretty sure he can handle whatever's in the lake."Hermione looked slightly reassured, but not fully. She turned her attention back to the Lake, while Annie silently prayed she was right, and that Harry was alright. She'd bet an entire year's wage that Ron was Harry's hostage; no one else was as close to Harry, apart for Hermione. Annie's eyelids began to feel heavy and she began to doze off slightly before Hermione's shrill scream cut through the air."There they are!"A ginger head and a blonde one could be faintly seen bobbing among the waves, but not the black hair of Harry, causing Annie to get nervous. She knew Dumbledore wouldn't let any harm come to the champions, but some things were out of Dumbledore's control. The ginger and blonde soon reached the pier, and as soon as they managed to get on the platform â€“ Ron had to help the little girl up â€“ they were immediately engulfed in the crowd.Annie grabbed a healer's bag and headed to the little girl first, fully knowing Ron would insist on her getting checked first. Annie managed to push through the crowd, until the little blonde French girl stood in front of her, an older girl standing next to her."Hello," Annie said, interrupting the two girls who were babbling away in French. "Sorry, I'm just here to make sure you are both alright.""'Ello," The older one, who Annie recognised as Fleur Delacour, the Beauxbatons champion, greeted. "My name ezz Fleur and this is my leetle seester Gabrielle."Gabrielle blushed slightly and buried her face in Fleur's robes before muttering to Fleur in French. Fleur replied quickly replied in a soothing tone. Annie picked up on the tension, so thought it would be best to talk."Tout va bien?" She asked, causing the two platinum blonde haired girls to look at Annie curiously."Vous parlez franÃ§ais?" Fleur asked, and Gabrielle looked at Annie a little less shyly."Oui , j'avais de la famille qui a vÃ©cu en France . J'ai appris quand je suis allÃ© leur rendre visite quand j'Ã©tais plus jeune," Annie explained, which made the two girls smile.Gabrielle seemed much more relaxed speaking in her native tongue, as did Fleur. Annie mostly managed to keep up with the rapid French, stumbling a few times, but it did help the conversation flow better. Fleur's English was, to say the least, 'pas le meilleur'.By the time Annie was finished checking the two French sisters, Harry had emerged out of the water and the results were given for the champions. Annie applauded enthusiastically for all of them (the Hogwarts champions, perhaps a bit more), and with a promise to meet up with Fleur and Gabrielle again, began to head back towards the boats.When she got back on to the mainland, just as she was heading back up to the castle, she heard a shout from behind her."Miss Ainsworth?" Professor Dumbledore called. Annie turned and walked over to where Dumbledore was stood talking to Mr Crouch and Mad-Eye."Barty, I don't think I have introduced you to our new healer at Hogwarts. May I present Miss Annie Ainsworth. She was a pupil here not so long ago, before she went on to take a course on Healing at St Mungo's. Professor Sprout personally pushed for her placement to be here. Miss Ainsworth, this is Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.""Nice to meet you," Annie said politely, if somewhat strained. She did not like the way he was looking at her, as if she was someone else. His face had turned so white it looked as though he had seen a ghost.Mr Crouch gave a slight nod before quickly saying he had business to attend to. Dumbledore said he would escort him up to the castle, leaving Annie with Mad Eye, which made her feel even more uncomfortable. Mad-Eye did not seem himself, nor had he for a long time. He also looked at Annie the same way Mr Crouch had; like they were looking through Annie at someone else.Just as Mad-Eye was about to ask Annie something, a voice Annie really didn't want to hear interrupted him."Professor Moody, is it alright if I steal Annie for a minute?" Charlie said.Annie internally groaned and she could feel the anger building up inside of her. Mad-Eye muttered something and stalked off, leaving the two young adults alone. Clenching her fists, Annie began to walk away from the redhead, really not wanting to talk to him."That's the thanks I get?" Charlie shouted after Annie. A surge of anger ran though Annie and against her voice of reason, she turned to face Charlie."What do you want me to say? Thank you for sending Mad-Eye away? Or would you rather me thank you for kissing me when I was going out with someone?!"Charlie sighed, running a hand though his hair."Look, I'm sorry for kissing you so abruptly, but-""No!" Annie shouted, causing Charlie to jump slightly. "You don't get to use 'but'! You don't go around kissing people unexpectedly, especially when they are in a relationship!""What do you want me to say?!" Charlie shouted. "I'm sorry I kissed you?! What do you want me to say?!""I don't know! At least tell me why you did it?""Did you like it?" Charlie demanded, causing Annie to stop in her tracks."What?" She said, her voice lowering slightly."Did you like it?"Annie open her mouth, but no words came out."I don't have to answer this," Annie muttered. "I'm goingâ€¦""You can't tell me you were happy with Chris!" Charlie exclaimed. "You were miserable, everyone could see that!""And why do you care?" Annie demanded, this time stopping Charlie. When he didn't reply, she laughed. "Just as I thought. Well, you know what? I'm done with you Charlie. I can't take any more of thisâ€¦"Annie ran towards the castle, ignoring Charlie's shouts. She hastily brushed away a tear that spilled from her eye, hoping the rest wouldn't. Inside, it was killing her that when asked why Charlie cared, he didn't reply. Somewhere, deep down, she wanted him to reply.Please review!

Oh my God, I am so sorry about the delay! I've just been so busy with school, what with uni application and stuff. Thank you so much for all the reviews and to anyone who has favourited or followed. Also, a big shout out to MelodyPond77, who has been an AMAZING beta over the last few months. Anyway, I should try and get a new chapter out sometime in the next week so until then, please enjoy this one! Maybe we shouldn't be looking for love. Maybe we should be looking for a person. Because maybe you can find love in a person, but not have that person. So if you look for love, what you will find is love. But if you want to belong to someone, and you want someone to belong to you, you should look for a person- C. JoyBell C.4th March 1995Annie chewed her lip nervously. Do I look alright? Merlin, I don't have anything stuck in my teeth, do I? Does this dress go with these heels? No, they don't! That's it, tonight is a disaster! She thought."Um, Annie?" A voice from behind the menu asked."Yes?""Are you alright?""Yes, why wouldn't I be?""Well, you've been hiding behind a menu with three choices for the past five minutes."Annie internally gasped, mentally slapping herself for being such an idiot. Slightly embarrassed, she lowered the menu and looked at the young man sitting across from her."Well, you know, I just couldn't decide between the chicken and the steak," Annie tried to joke. Apparently it must have worked, because he laughed, which made her relax slightly."I'm sorry, it's just that I haven't been on a first date for a long time," She apologised."No, no, I know exactly how you feel."Annie managed to smile, and she looked across at her date.She was surprised when he had asked her out, having parted on not quite ideal terms, but it was in the past. It was a long time ago, after all."So, what have you been up to since the last time I saw you, Thomas?" Annie asked.Across the table to Annie, sat Thomas Richards, a boy with whom she used to go to grade school. She had bumped into Thomas while shopping in the muggle part of London the other week. After catching up, Thomas had asked her out, and Annie, seeing no reason why she should not, had agreed. She knew most muggle-wizard relationships did not work, but some of them did. Maybe this could be one of them.They sat in a fancy restaurant on the North Bank of the River Thames, both dressed formally, but Annie felt slightly uncomfortable for some reason. Yes, the date was going well, but it just didn't feel right. Thomas had met her outside of the Tube station, gave her a bunch of pretty white roses and kissed her hand like the perfect gentleman. It felt off though.Thomas was a nice man, but he just didn't seem like the type of boy Annie would want to take home. When he kissed her, Annie feltâ€¦nothing. There wasn't a spark or even a slight warm blush that crept up her cheek."So then," Thomas said slowly, once they had ordered."So thenâ€¦" Annie repeated, unsure on what to say or do.They sat in awkward silence for a few minutes, both debating whether to speak or not."I'm sorry, this is a little weird for me. I haven't been on a date for a while," Thomas explained. "Actually, this will be the first time we've spoken to each other in what? Ten years?""Yeah, around ten years. Just before I went off to boarding school," Annie said, taking a sip of her wine. "And don't apologise, I haven't been out for a while either."Thomas grinned and he looked slightly more relaxed."So, where was your boarding school at? You were there for most of the year, weren't you?" He asked."Yeah, I only came home for the holidays. It's up in Scotland, middle of no-where. In fact, unless you knew where it was, you probably wouldn't even find it," Annie said. She was telling the truth â€“ mostly."That's cool. What it is you do, now?""I'm a hea-nurse. Training to be a doctor," Annie quickly said. She would have to make sure she avoided using any word somewhat magic related. "What is it you're doing?""I'm in police training," Thomas replied. "There's an academy in Ealing and it's easy enough to get to on the tube."Silence then fell on the table as the conversation ended; the only thing they could think about already been discussed."So, what's your story?" Thomas asked."Excuse me?" Annie asked, slightly puzzled."Well, from the fact that you spent a good five minutes hidden behind the menu, and that before that you spent about ten minutes in the bathroom, I think there's a story to why you're here. And I think it involves a guyâ€¦" Thomas said, causing Annie to redden from embarrassment slightly."It's nothing, reallyâ€¦" She stammered, only to be silenced by Thomas' hand."I'll make you a deal; a question for an answer. You ask me anything and I'll answer and vice versa," He offered. "Deal?""Alright then," Annie agreed. "You can go first.""Okay then. Is there a guy?"Annie grimaced."It's slightly complicatedâ€¦""Go on.""Well, I had been dating this guy, Chris, for about six years, and he was my first serious relationship. Then, at a work party, someone from my school kissed me. I don't think Chris ever found out, but he had never liked the boy, Charlie, even when we were in school.Anyway, Chris got offered a job in Hong Kong and wanted me to move there with him. But the night he asked was the first date we had been out on for nearly a year. He was always busy with work and I didn't think we were in love anymore so we split up. He said some horrible things about me when we did.After that, I avoided the guy who kissed me. I know it's stupid, but for some reason, I think I blame him for the break up, just so I can blame someone. He used to get on my nerves at school, and I didn't like him but now after kissing him, I'm not even too sure how I feel about him but I've definitely messed things up with him, because I had a right go at him the other week and-""Annie!" Thomas exclaimed as Annie began to rally herself up. She felt a tear slide down her cheek and quickly brushed it away."Annie," Thomas said again, in a softer tone. "I see what you mean about complicated."Annie managed a small laugh, which Thomas mirrored. He sat back in his chair and studied her face. After a minute of silence, he began to slowly speak."It seems to me," He began. "That, while you don't want to admit it, you do have feelings for this 'Charlie'. To some degree, you do like him, but you've managed to convince yourself that you don't. But you've missed the point.""What point?"Thomas looked at her and after taking a sip of his wine, he stated,"He kissed you," He said bluntly."So?" Annie asked."'So?' Annie, there has to be a reason why he kissed you. He likes you! You've gotten yourself worried about messing things up when he clearly likes you. If he likes you that much, he won't care! Now all you've got to do is convince yourself that you like him as much and ask him out!"""Couldn't have said it better myself," A new voice cut across the two's conversation.Both Annie and Thomas looked up and Annie's heart jittered and paused slightly when she saw the familiar bubble-gum pink-haired woman grinned down at them. She groaned slightly while Thomas smiled politely, not knowing who the woman was."Hi, could we get some more wine, please?" He asked, assuming she was a waitress."I'd love some," She replied, grinning at Thomas' confused expression. She pulled up a chair and sat down."I'm Tonks," Tonks said. "Annie's best friend."She then turned to face the embarrassed blonde."What are you doing here? Don't you have to be at work?" Annie questioned, mentally cursing her friend.Tonks simply grinned and helped herself to some wine, pouring it into Annie's water glass."So, I go round to your flat, expecting you to be sat in your pyjamas; eating ice cream and binge watching that 'Friends' thing you like on the magic box while using Jasper as a hot water bottle. But you're not! You're in a fancy restaurant, you're wearing nice clothes, you used that perfume I got you, aren't you?" Tonks asked, taking a sniff of Annie. The blonde swatted the girl away, causing Tonks to laugh."You're on the pull! You look good too! None of my advice was needed.""Are you after something in particular? Or is just one of those times you assume the pseudo older sister role?" Annie asked though a fake smile."Nope! Actually got a reason to be here," Tonks said."Well, it had better be a good reason," Annie replied though barred teeth."Come on, we're going to the bathroom," Tonks said, grabbing Annie's arm. From behind her, Annie could hear Thomas' saying he'd stay there. He was being a Saint for putting up with all this.Once in the Ladies' room, Tonks checked to see if there was anyone in the stalls, before casting an imperturbable charm on the room so that they would not be interrupted."What's the meaning of all this, Tonks?" Annie asked, arms folded across her body as she walked across the room, her heels making a soft clicking noise against the tiles."A muggle, Annie? Really?" Tonks asked. "Have you lost your mind? What were you thinking? All muggle-wizard relationships tend to end badly!""Not all of them do!" Annie stated, turning to face Tonks. "This one may not either.""Annie, you cannot date a muggle.""Why not? Plenty of people do," Annie pointed out. "In fact, a lot of people we know are half and half-""You're missing the point!" Tonks exclaimed. "If things did go well and if you did marry this- this-"She looked to Annie for help."Thomas," She said lightly."'Thomas'" Tonks air-quoted. "You could never tell him about us! About the entire wizarding world! You'd have to give up your job, move house, and you would never be able to use magic in front of him. Is that the life you want? You'd barley see any of your friends, me included! You said so yourself, you hated muggle life!"Annie was silent for a minute before sighing defeatedly and dropping to the floor â€“ which, thankfully, was quiet clean."You're right. I didn't think. I'm sorry," Annie said in a quiet voice. "I just thought it would be nice to get away from all the drama and heartache and just start a clean slate."Tonks gave a solemn smiled and sat down next to Annie."I get it. But, yet again, you're missing the point."When Annie looked at her with a confused expression, Tonks laughed lightly."You know, for being one of the smartest witches in our year, you can be quite thick sometimes," After Annie gave her a comical shove, Tonks sighed before continuing."You admitted it," She bluntly said."Admitted what?" Annie asked, still puzzled. Tonks looked at her with a knowing expression."You like Charlie," She said.The gears in Annie's brain began to turn. Tonks was right, she had admitted it. She liked Charlie. Annie Lauryn Ainsworth liked Charles Septimus Weasley. Annie aimait Charlie, no this was not the time to be thinking in French. But, in whatever language you said it in, the fact still remained. Annie liked Charlie. And Annie had messed things up between them."Oh my god," Annie wailed, burying her head in her arms. "I do, don't I? I like Charlie. And now I've only gone and messed things up with him!""No you haven't," Tonks told her, in a soothing tone. "Charlie has, and always has liked you. You couldn't put him off. Honestly, I think that was the most obvious piece of gossip in our year!""Where was I when this gossip was going round?" Annie asked."Snogging the face off that pompous dickhead known as Chris," Tonks said simply, causing them both to laugh. "Anyway, now you've admitted it, we've got to go somewhere.""Where?" Annie asked."Well, first you've got to talk to Thomas.""Oh no, that is not going to be a fun conversation," Annie sighed."Nah, Thomas will be cool about it. I think he gets where you're coming from. If not, I'll just oblivate him.""Tonks!""Just kidding," Tonks grinned, holding her hands up in defence. "Off you pop then. And don't take too long about it, we've got to get going soon."After leaving the bathroom, Annie went to talk to Thomas, who, thankfully, fully understand Annie's departing, saying that she had to make the right decision for herself. Although he did seemed slightly upset, he seemed to perk up slightly when Tonks somehow introduced him to a pretty black haired girl whose date had stood her up. After putting in a good work for Thomas, the two witches quickly left, apperating to outside of Annie's flat."So, what's this all about?" Annie asked, fishing her keys out of her bag."Oh, you'll see," Tonks said mischievously."Fine, don't tell me," Annie huffed.She unlocked the apartment's door and just as she had taken the key out of the keyhole, she felt a shove from behind her and the door slammed and locked behind her."Tonks!" Annie shouted. "What the hell are you doing?""You'll thank me one day!" Was the only reply she got. She was about to apperate out of the flat when a new voice distracted her."Annie?" Said girl turned and saw a familiar redhead sitting on her couch in her flat, with a confused expression mirroring her own."Charlie?" Annie stuttered, wondering just what had Tonks done.Oh Merlin, Annie thought. This is going to be a long night. And I'm pretty sure I'm all out of wineâ€¦Yes, I'm evil. Please review!

Hey! Back again with another update! Well, you've waited for this chapter for ages and it's finally here! What will happen? Who will Annie choose? How did Charlie get into Annie's flat (actually, you won't find that out this chapter). But thank you for all the lovely responses! It's great to know that so many people are enjoying it!On another note, that last chapter was the longest one I have wrote yet! Cookies for me! Haha, sorry, but this chapter isn't as long. I think you'll all like it though. Gotta love Tonks, don't ya?Anyway, without further ado, chapter 52! Please read, review and enjoy!He's not perfect. You aren't either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry, he's not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect for more than he can give. Don't analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don't exist, but there's always one guy that is perfect for you-Bob Marely4th March 1995 Part 2The two stared at each other for what Annie thought felt like hours but in reality, it couldn't have been longer than a minute tops. Both seemed unable to speak; neither one of them knowing what to say. After another minute of silence, Annie spoke."Hi," She said, slightly cautiously."Hi," Charlie replied, wringing out his hands nervously.Annie looked at him, still perplexed at what Tonks had done to evenâ€¦ Annie didn't know. But when Tonks wanted something done, she got it done. Annie still didn't know how to react though. The nerves were getting the best of her."Hi," She said again, feeling tongued tied.What was she supposed to say? Not even half an hour ago she would never admit she liked Charlie, and now, a mere thirty minutes later, she had managed to overcome the nerves, and tell herself â€“ as well as her best friend and a somewhat semi stranger â€“ that she liked the boy she previously thought she hated for the entire of her school years. Not only had the same boy kissed her when she least expected it (and she did slightly enjoy it), he was now somehow magically â€“ probably not the best word to use â€“ sat on the worn couch in the middle of her living room.Talk about a sign from above."You already said that," Charlie said, the nervousness evident in the tone of his voice. Somehow, this managed to relax Annie, knowing he was as nervous as she was."Um, sorry, itâ€¦it's just been a long night," Annie apologised, folding her arms across her body in an almost defensive manner.The silence once again grew, with the two young adults avoiding eye contact with one another."Would you like a drink or something?" Annie asked, trying to be polite. It was her home and although it was unexpected, she did have a guest â€“ even if this guest had been her longer than she had."Okay," Charlie nodded, his shoulders relaxing slightly."What would you like? I've got tea, coffee, water, juice, I think I've got some butterbeer if you'd like-""Tea is fine," Charlie cut across Annie, just as she started to ramble. She nodded and walked over to the small kitchenette of her studio apartment. Dumping her bag and coat on the island, Annie picked up the kettle, filled it with water from the tap and set it on to boil on the stove. She grabbed a red mug and a yellow mug out of the cupboard and chucked a tea bag in each.Annie silently thanked that she had to turn away from Charlie to make the tea; she knew he was watching her but at least this way she didn't have to speak to him. However, it did make her feel a bit self-conscious. Once the water had boiled, she turned to face Charlie, who quickly looked away and his face reddened in realisation that she had seen him looking."Would you like milk and sugar?" She asked, ignoring his blushed face."Yeah- Um- milk and two sugars, please," He stammered.Annie nodded and kept a cool expression on her face as she turned to open the 50's style fridge -clearly muggle. She picked up the glass milk bottle, used her foot to close the door, walked head first into a solidly built body and promptly dropped the milk bottle.She swore loudly, as did Charlie."I'm sorry!" Charlie quickly exclaimed. Annie bent down to pick up the glass shards, and Charlie copied her. "I thought you might have wanted a hand so I-"Annie held up a hand and he stopped speaking."It's fine," She told him. "I'm pretty sure I've got another bottle of milk in the fridge."Charlie nodded and they began to pick up the stray pieces of glass, some of which were surprisingly sharp. It really didn't help when Annie â€“ who was still wearing the heels she had put on for her date â€“ twisted her leg sharply which caused her to fall straight on to some shards which were especially sharp."Shit!" Charlie cried as Annie gasped in pain as the glass stabbed at her skin. Specks of crimson blood fell on to the wooden floor as the wound began to bleed. "Annie, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to-"Instead of shouting or swearing, Annie began to laugh, which caused Charlie to give her a questioning, yet still panicked, look."Why are you laughing?" Charlie asked. "Shouldn't you be shouting or swearing or crying or whatever girls normally do when the get hurt?!""Charlie, I'm a trained healer. I think I can handle a few shards of glass," She said. "Anyway, why are you apologising? You didn't do anything; it was my own stupid fault."Charlie's face began to redden again, and he looked embarrassed."Yeah, well, it was my fault you dropped the bottle. I shouldn't have startled you like I did," Charlie said, hanging his head slightly."Yes, well, I was the one who was wearing the heels that caused me to trip in the first place," Annie said lightly, beginning to smile for some reason. Even though she'd just made an idiot of herself, she could feel the mood beginning to lighten."Do you need anything?" Charlie asked quickly. "I can take you to St Mungo's if you'd like."Annie scoffed."If I go to work with such a minor injury, I'd be a laughing stock. If you want, you could go into the bathroom and grab my first aid kit out of the cabinet?" She asked. Charlie nodded and pointed to a door next to wear the couch was."That room?" He asked."Yeah," Annie replied. "There'll be a small white bag under the sink."Charlie nodded and walked off to get the bag. Annie let out a hiss of pain as he left and looked down at her leg. For a few pieces of glass, it was cut up pretty badly, with blood steadily seeping out of the deepest cut. Easily healed though.Using the bench as support, Annie lifted herself into a standing position, kicked off her heels and, while being careful to avoid any stray pieces of glass, limped over to the couch, being careful not to put any weight on her injured leg. She stumbled slightly, and grabbed on to one of the beams to steady herself. She felt strong arms wrap around her shoulders and looked to see Charlie holding her as though she was a porcelain doll."Here," He said, guiding her to one of the couches. He gently lowered her in to a sitting position and helped her proper her leg on the small coffee table. After doing this, he sat on the seat opposite and placed the first aid kit on the table."Do you need any help?" He asked. Annie shook her head."No, I can manage," Annie said, digging though the small bag. "Thanks though."There was silence and Annie quietly clean her cuts, using a pair of tweezers to pull out shards of glass. Charlie sat in equal silence, fidgeting as he watched Annie calmly clean the cuts."Could you pass me my wand?" Annie asked, breaking the awkward silence. "It's in my bag on the bench."Charlie nodded and quickly retrieved the wand from the bag."Is this willow?" He asked curiously as he walked back to the living area. Annie nodded."Yeah. Willow, nine and three quarter inches, phoenix hair," Annie said. Charlie handed her the wand and she smiled in thanks.She waved her wand over the cuts and smiled as she watched the cuts magically stich themselves together. Annie quickly wrapped her leg up in a bandage, to stop any further bleeding."Tergeo," She muttered and the dried blood on her leg vanished.The eerie silence fell upon the room again, both still not knowing what to say. He's supposed to be the Gryffindor, Annie thought. Isn't the bravery thing built in? He can knock me off my broom but not have a normal conversation with me? Merlin, Annie, man up and speak!"So then," She said, repeating what she had said to Thomas nearly an hour ago. She thought she was nervous then but looking back, that was like a walk in the park!"So then," Charlie mimicked, smirking slightly. "I like your flat.""Thanks," Annie said, looking round her home. "After Chrisâ€¦I just had to get out, you know?"Charlie nodded, looking slightly uneasy at talking about Chris. Annie sighed."I don't think we should be making small talk at a time like this, Charlie," She said, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "What's next, we talk about the weather? How very British of us."Charlie managed a laugh and smiled widely."Well, we have had nice weather lately," He smiled.This did cause Annie to smile weakly as she looked down at her hands."I'm sorry for what I said last week," Annie said, her gaze not moving from her hands. "I was mad and bitter and looking for someone to blame-""Hey," Charlie said, stopping her from speaking. He reached across the coffee table and gently took one of her hands, which made Annie look up at him. "I shouldn't have kissed you like that at Christmas. I knew you were with Chris butâ€¦ I don't know!"Annie was silent for minute."Don't apologise," She said softly. "I mean, yeah, I'm still mad at you for doing that butâ€¦I did like it. Andâ€¦ I think, that is, in the long run, it did help me to break up with Chris."Charlie's head shot up."How so?"Annie fiddled with the long sleeves of her red dress."Well, the kiss, it helped me realise, that when I was with Chrisâ€¦ it didn't feel right. I didn't feel anything anymore. And from that, it helped me to see that I wasn't happy living like that.""But, you liked it, right?"This time it was Annie's turn to blush."Yes. As painful as it is to admit, I did like it," She said.Charlie's face lit up."So, what about us?" He asked.Annie looked at him with a puzzled expression."Us?""Us. Where do we go from here?"Annie sighed."I-I don't know. I mean, my head's literally everywhere. I think I like you, but I'm not sure. And I'm not sure if I'm ready or if you are-"From out of nowhere, Charlie's lips crashed against hers, stopping her train of thought. It felt like the kiss at the Yule Ball, only this time she felt more relaxed and it felt right. She allowed herself to enjoy it and yes, she did like it. Unlike Chris' kisses, when she kissed Charlie it felt likeâ€¦fireworks. Like two parts of a puzzle fitting together.When they pulled away, their foreheads rested against one another's, both still taking in what had happened."Annie?" Charlie said and the two pulled away. Annie looked in to the clear blueness of his eyes. It felt right. "Annie, I've liked you since first year, since that stupid day when I snapped at you, since our first Quidditch match, since that time you tripped up the stairs and Tonks threatened to hex me. I know this must be hard for you, but I like you. Hell, I might even love you.I'm sorry if that scares you off but that's how I feel. I know that your favourite flowers are sunflowers, your favourite sweet are mint humbugs, that you support the Holyhead Harpies and that you collect old edition books.Annie, if you look me in the eye and tell me you don't have even the smallest amount of affection for me, I'll leave and I won't come back. But, now you know how I feel so it's all cards on the table. Make your choice."Annie sat there, dumbfounded. She couldn't believe it. She studied his face, trying to see if he was lying. But he wasn't. From the redness of his hair, to his crooked smile. The splattering of freckles across his tanned skin, the blueness of his eyes which she found herself getting lost in, the faint scars on his cheeks from the years of working with dragons.She kissed him. Lean across the coffee table like he had done and kissed him on the lips. She let her hand run through his hair and his hand went to her hip. She enjoyed every second. They pulled back, both slightly breathless."I've made my choice," She said softly. "I choose you."Charlie grinned which caused her to smile."I'm sorry to tell you this, but if you want milk in your tea, it appears I'm all out," She said slyly, looking over to where the kettle stood, probably stone cold now. Charlie smirked."I think I want to take my girlfriend out for a drink," He grinned and Annie found herself laughing. Girlfriend, she thought. I, Annie Lauryn Ainsworth, am the girlfriend of Charlie Weasley. That sounds good."Well then," Annie said, getting to her feet. "Where is my boyfriend going to take me?"Both grinning, they grabbed their stuff and apperated out of the flat, both thanking Tonks for making it happen.Please review!

So, I'll take it as you all liked the last chapter?Yay! They're finally together! And it only took what? 52 chapters? The big question is, what happens next?Thank you for the reviews, favs and follows! Every time I get an email, I have a bit squeal inside... Okay, I need to get out more...Please read, review and enjoy!It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves- William Shakespear5th March 1995Dear Nymph,Thanks. You were right. There, I said it. I want the keys back to my flat, though. You little sneak!-AnnieP.S. Still can't believe you put money on it. How much was it?5th March 1995Dear Annie,I am not a thief! I am simply take things without asking first, but I always give them back! (Well, most of the time).Anyway, I KNEW IT! I bloody knew it! You've liked Charlie Weasley all these years and now you two are dating and you'll get married and have enough kids to form your own Quidditch teamâ€¦ I really need to get out moreâ€¦Nah, I'm still awesome as always!-TonksP.S. More than a little, less than a lot5th March 1995Dear NymphYou're a thief and you know it. May I refer you back to the case of my missing left shoe? Every day for a month straight you would hide it! And I was always late to Potions because of it. Now, Snape absolutely hates me! Especially after the incident with the exploding cauldronâ€¦which, may I remind you, was your fault too!Okay, okay, hold your hippogriffs. Just because I'm now dating him (Merlin, that sounds weird, never thought I'd say that!), DOESN'T mean I will marry him or have a whole brood of ginger Quidditch players for kids!No, you're not. You are very mean with a hyper-active imagination and a cruel sense of humour and I hate you.Just kidding.-AnnieP.S. How much is that? I mean, I know you're supposed to be all allusive and confidential with being an Auror but you can't even tell your own best friend how much money you bet on her getting with her ex-worst enemy? (Yet another thing I never thought I'd have to say).P.S.S. Who did you even make this bet with?P.S.S.S. And how did you even get Charlie in to my bloody flat?!5th March 1995Dear Bill,When you said, and I quote 'Lads night out, just you and me,' I did not expect my wand being taken off of me and getting pushed into some randomer's house. Furthermore, I did not expect the girl I like being pushed into what turns out to be her flat, and getting locked in with her when she basically debunked me! Honestly, Bill, for a split second, I feared for my life.However, the fact that the outcome was that the girl who I have liked for the past eleven years somehow agreed to go out with me! We had a lovely night of drinking and discussing how we were going to seriously maim the people who basically pushed us together. (I said maim, not kill, so we weren't that mad).I look forward to the day when you are too chicken to ask a girl out and I get the pleasure of pulling one over on you.Although I know I'll never hear the end of it, here it goes. Thank you, William Arthur Weasley, you truly are the best older brother in the world. And if you ever make me repeat this, I will hex you into oblivion.Thanks, idiot.-CharlieP.S. Just to add, Annie actually had her wand and didn't apperate. And, she did end up kissing me. Just saying, I'm doing fine on my own.5th March 1995Dear Charlie, my moron of a brother,What?! We did have a drink out first! Can I just say, best visit home. Ever. Well, maybe not as good as the World Cup, but it's still up near the top.You're not mad at me. In fact, you're slightly envious of me because, unlike you, the girls love me. Any girl I have liked hasn't spent at least ten years of the eleven years I've know them, hating my guts. So, score one for the older brother.Please. As if I'd ever be nervous of asking a girl out.Ha! I have it in writing! On your wedding day, I will tell everyone that I was right (well, sort of). That you and Annie own the many years of happiness to Tonks and I (yes, she helped. But if anyone asks, it was my idea.)Aw, how cute. Little Charlie got his dream girl. Mum'll love it; she'll be planning the wedding in no time!May be difficult for you to except (as it is for me to admit), but I know you can do alright on your own. Some of the time.-Bill6th March 1995Dear Dad,Just a quick note to say hi. How's the restaurant going? You're not making Alison work too hard, are you? And how's the new boy â€“ Zack, isn't it? I know I haven't written for a week or two, it's just I've been busy at work. Cedric came first in the Second Task. You know, of the Tournament? The Quidditch player from Durmstrang originally came second but the judges decided that Harry should come second because of, and I quote, 'Outstanding moral fibre', meaning he was really selfless in the task and waited until everyone else had recovered their friend first. He's just like that.Tonks says hi.Love, AnnieP.S. I have a boyfriend.6th March 1995Dear Mum and Dad,How's everything at home? Told you I'd write after the Task, didn't I? And before you ask, Ron and Harry are both fine. Just saw them yesterday, trying to get some homework done (Hermione already had it done.The twins are fine too. Don't worry, they haven't blown up a toilet or anything (yet). Saw Bill last night and he sends his love. I'm sorry I couldn't stay for lunch yesterday, Bill dragged me out because we hadâ€¦ stuff to do. It's all sorted.Really missing your cooking! Most of the meals I make taste like raw dragon hideâ€¦ Had a nice meal the other day. Homemade Lancashire Hotpot. It was great.Lots of Love,CharlieP.S. I have a girlfriend now. Her name is Annie.7th March 1995Dear Annie,Before I start, I would like you to recall your seventh birthday, when you said, and I quote, 'Boys are icky.' That particular comment was made after little Robert Brown had tried to kiss you during the game of musical statues. You then proceed to promise me you'd never date a boy until you were thirty (I have it in writing).When Chris first came round, I did think back to that promise, however, I was confident that it was merely puppy love and you would soon grow out of it. Although you did not, I did find myself somewhat relieved when you broke up with him because, let's face it, the boy was a fool. It may just be a parent's pride, wanting the best for their child, but that boy did not deserve you. So, now as I write this letter, I find myself asking, is this boy worth it?Yet again, I am simply being an over protective parent, but I do not what another boy messing with your feelings. I know you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince but after what happened with Chrisâ€¦I'm a parent, Annie. After your motherâ€¦ I just don't want you to get hurt again.You only broke up with Chris a few months ago, are you sure you're ready for this? Love,DadP.S. If you are, then he must really be something.7th March 1995Charlie!You have a girlfriend! And you only slipped it in at the end of your letter! I am your mother! I should be first to hear this sort of thing. Of course, your father and I are thrilled! Oh, you must bring her round for tea. Are you both free on Saturday? I'll make sure your father and Percy are home, could you ask Bill? He's been so busy these past few days, meeting up with all his old school friends. I want to know all about her! What's her name? What does she do? Where did you meet?Oh! What should I cook?! What are her likes and dislikes? She's not allergic to anything is she? The dear. Little Charlie's got a girlfriend! Oh I just can't believe it!Love,Mum7th March 1995Dear Charlie,With any luck, this letter will have arrived after your mother's. Please excuse her, she was a bit overenthusiastic when she found out.It's that lovely girl, Annie, isn't it? I thought you had a bit of a fancy for her when we saw her at the World Cup. And let me guess, Bill and her friend Tonks, helped set you up?I'll see you on Saturday. Must go, have to stop your mother from planning the wedding.Love, Dad7th March 1995Dear Nymph,I need your help. I'm meeting Charlie's mother on Saturday. I've already meet Mr Weasley before, but mothers are completely different! What if she doesn't like me?-Annie7th March 1995Dear Annie,You worry too much. I've meet Mrs Weasley, and let me tell you, she'll love you!Got to go, work and stuff.Love,TonksP.S. She is an AMAZING cook.7th March 1995Dear Dad,Thanks. Really, I know you care. But don't worry, I have a good feeling about this.Lots of Love,AnniePlease review

Sorry about the late update! On the bright side, Happy Halloween! She says a day late. Oh well, props for trying. Yay! Annie meets Mrs Weasley. In advance, the endings a bit rubbish, I had to write it in a rush. Sorry!Okay, I'll leave you with this. Probably update in about a week? Back to school on Monday and ~I have so much homework to do.Read, review and enjoy!God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers- Rudyard Kipling10th March 1995Charlie stared at the cheery, tomato red door in front of him. He had been stood there for the past five minutes but had yet to pluck up enough courage to knock on the door. He was nervous. Did he look nervous? That would be a great way to start the night.Did he look alright? Merlin, he hoped he did. Although it made him sound like a teenage girl, but he was really worried about how he looked. He had went for smart casual, not wanting to overdress for a simple meal with his family. He didn't look too underdressed, did he?Enough, Charlie scolded himself. You look fine. Anyway, it's too late to change now.He fiddled with the sleeves of his long navy jumper as he continued to stare at the door. In his hand, he held a bouquet of sunflowers. It's not too early to give her flowers, is it? We have just be dating a week. Then again, she is meeting my parents quite quickly.Charlie hoped his family would be alright tonight, or more specifically, his mother. He did not want her scaring off the girl he had spent eleven years going after. He knew his father, Bill and Percy would be alright. Hell, they adored Annie.It was just his mother, Charlie was worried about.Whenever a Weasley brought a girl home, their mother would immediately quiz them onâ€¦well, everything. Their job, their lifestyle, their prospects for the future, everything. Even how many children she wanted.Needless to say, not many girls had lasted the visit to meeting the Weasley parents.Charlie sincerely hoped his mother would tone it down slightly, just for tonight. Just enough to not send Annie screaming for the hills.He sighed.He was simply over reacting. His father knew how much he liked Annie and probably had already told his mother about it. That, however, made Charlie even more nervous.That's it, Charlie thought. Time to man up.Charlie raised his hand to knock on the door, when a loud crash rang out from inside Annie's flat, followed by a string of loud cursing. Charlie didn't bother to knock as he burst into the flat. He could see Annie's leg peeking out from behind the kitchen counter and he ran round to help her.Annie was laying on the kitchen floor, dazed look on her face. Beside her, lay an overturned cooking book, sprawled out on the last page read."Annie, are you okay?" Charlie asked, kneeling down next to her. Annie groaned."Bloody catâ€¦"Charlie looked up and saw Jasper sitting on the kitchen bench, with an almost smug look on his face as he watched the redhead. Charlie rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around Annie's shoulder, helping her to her feet. When she was stood up, Charlie smiled."So, what happened?" He asked, picking up the book for Annie and giving it to her. She smiled."I was reading and I wasn't looking where I was going. Didn't see Jasper and I tripped over him," She replied, placing the book on the bench."Are you alright?" Charlie asked, slightly worried about his girlfriend â€“ that feels so weird to say. "Yes, I'm fine," Annie quickly brushed off. "Anyway, do I look alright like this?" She asked, extending her arms so that Charlie could see her outfit."You look great," Charlie grinned. "Are you ready to go?""Yeah, just give me two minutes," Annie smiled. "Just have a sit down."Charlie nodded as she walked off in the direction of her room, her boots clicking against the wooden floorboards. He grinned and went to sit on the couch, Jasper appearing next to him."Hey, boy," He murmured, stroking the cat between the ears. The cat purred in content, curling up against Charlie's leg. Charlie's free hand drummed against his knee, nervous for what would happen today. Jasper, as though he could sense Charlie's nervousness, brushed his head against Charlie's hand and meowed, almost reassuringly. Charlie managed a smile."Okay then," Annie said from the kitchen. She had her head in the fridge and from what Charlie could see, was pulling something out of the fridge."What's that?" Charlie asked as he stood over and walked over. Annie turned round to face him, smile on her face and in her hands was a foil covered dish."Banoffee pie," She said simply. "Could you please hold it for a minute?"Charlie nodded and gently took the dish out of her arms. Annie walked over to the kitchen counter, picked up her wand and waved it in the direction of the sink, where dirty dishes instantly became clean. Smiling, she slipped her wand into her boot, so the handle peaked out of the top."There," She smiled, turning back to Charlie. "I'll take that."As Annie went to take the dish back, Charlie moved away."It wouldn't be very nice of me make you carry this heavy thing, now would it?" He grinned, causing Annie to give him a questioning look."I'm more concerned about you eating it, than my wrists giving way," She replied, taking the dish from him. "Anyway, I don't trust you."Charlie put his hand over his heart and pretended to look offended,"I'm shocked that you'd even say that," He said. "But, it's probably true. I'd only take one bite though."Annie raised an eyebrow."Maybe two."Annie laughed."More like the whole thing," She said. She leaned up and kissed him on the cheek. "Good thing I made two."Charlie laughed and offered her his hand, which she took immediately. Her small hand was warm against his, and the touch made his heart flutter."Your hands are freezing," Annie commented. "Where have you been, Alaska?""You know what they say, cold hands, warm heart," Charlie smirked down at her."And what do they say about warm hands, then?" Annie asked."Warm hands, even warmer heart," He replied. "Though those people do seem dislike Banoffee pieâ€¦"Annie mockingly slapped Charlie's arm as he grinned."It's not just for you!" She cried, but was smiling."Okay, okay, it's for everyone," Charlie said. He checked his watch. "Okay, time to go."Annie nodded and the two left the flat, Annie locking the door on the way out."Ready?" Charlie asked.Annie nodded, and although she had a cool demure, he could see a flicker of nervousness in her eye."Yep," She said, nodding her head. I'm ready.""Hey," Charlie said, as he looked down into her brown eyes. "They'll love you. And anyway, it's only really Mum you have left to meet."Charlie could see Annie biting her lip slightly."Annie, listen to me, she'll love you," He told her firmly.Annie looked up at him, still unsure."Positive?" She asked."Positive," He agreed. "The fact that you made pie also gives you quite a good standing, since none of us have ever brought food home. So thanks for making us look bad."Annie slapped his arm again, but was smiling. Charlie grinned and the two disapperated.. . . . .Annie was nervous.Scratch that. She was more nervous than she had ever been in her life, and that included O. , N.E. , healer exams and her muggle driving test â€“ the latter not going too well.Annie had barely slept the night before, and had stressed the entire day over what to wear. She had ended up wearing a grey jumper, dark jeans, a red scarf (to tie in a bit of Gryffindor â€“ well, she was seeing an entire family of them), and her long brown boots.Oh, Merlin, she hoped she looked okay.Tonks had told her not to worry when she had stopped by the day before. According to her, Mrs Weasley was a lovely woman who, if aggravated, could be scarier than a fully grown Hungarian Horntail. To this, Annie replied by throwing a handful of flour at the Metamorphmagus, causing a food battle in the kitchen â€“ Annie was thankful she was a witch because when it happened when they were thirteen, it took four hours to clean up.Annie making the Banoffee pie was partly due to the hope of impressing Mrs Weasley, who apparently was 'the best cook in the World, well apart from my Mum,' according to Tonks. In truth, Annie was stressed about meeting the matriarch of the Weasley family.Annie took Charlie's hand, Charlie giving her a wide grin before they Disapperated.With a loud CRACK, the young couple appeared in a small yard, the Burrow towering over them.Annie gasped in amazement as she looked at the house with wide eyes, it was exactly how she thought a magical house should be. The building looked like it had several extra floors added over the years, and the number of chimneys led Annie to believe that there was a fireplace in every room. Annie concluded that the building must have been held up by magic, as there was no way a building like that could stand without."Come on," Charlie said, nodding his head towards what must have been the kitchen door. "They'll be waiting."He led the wide-eyed girl through the jumble of wellington boots that lay in the yard, as well as trying to avoid the roaming chickens, that were clucking away peacefully. Something moved in the corner of her eye, grabbing her attention. She turned and gasped slightly."Charlie, what's that?" She asked, pointing at the little bald headed figure.Charlie turned and laughed."It's a gnome, silly. Don't they have gnomes in the muggle world?" He asked."Yeah, but muggle gnomes tend to have pointy hats and beards. And, you know, they're ornaments," Annie explained. "A few of them look like they fish, too."Charlie frowned."Ours know a few swear words," He replied."Let me guess, Ron and the twins?" Annie asked, eyebrows raised in question."Got it in one," Charlie laughed. "Let's go."They left the bald gnome, who waved his balled fist at them, and Charlie led Annie into the kitchen of the Burrow. Instantly, they were hit with the smell of freshly baked bread. If the exterior of the house wasn't outstanding enough, the interior was.The kitchen was small and crowded, with a large, wooden table in the centre taking up a lot of the room. The furniture â€“ the chairs, in particular â€“ where mismatched, but they seemed to fit in at the same time. The clock on the wall was unusual, only having one hand and no numbers. Instead, written around the edges was things like 'You're late,' and 'Time to feed the chickens'. Annie assumed it was what Mrs Weasley used to keep everything in check."Through here," Charlie said, motioning to the door on the other side of the room.This time, they entered a cosy looking living room, where plump couches sat and a large fireplace stood. Various photographs decorated the room, as well as another clock, but this one had multiple hands."Charlie!" A voice cried. On the couches sat Mr Weasley, Bill and a red haired woman, Annie identified as Mrs Weasley. Mrs Weasley set down her knitting, stood up and walked over to her son and his girlfriend."Hi, Mum," Charlie grinned. He let go of Annie's hand to hug his mother. Annie smiled but began to fiddle with her sleeves from nerves."And this must be Annie!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed, turning to face the girl in question, who smiled slightly unsurely. Mrs Weasley must have picked up on Annie's nerves as she smiled widely and pulled her in to a back-breaking hug."Oh, I've heard so much about you!" She said, releasing Annie. "Lunch is almost ready, we're just waiting for Percy.""Typical Percy," Charlie grinned. "Always making us wait."Mrs Weasley told him off, but from the small smile on her face, Annie could tell she wasn't angry."Annie made pie, Mum," Charlie said, pointing to the dish in Annie's hands. "She wouldn't let me eat any, though.""I made two, didn't I?" Annie replied. "It's just Banoffee, it probably won't even be that niceâ€¦""I'm sure it will taste lovely, dear," Mrs Weasley reassured her. "I'm going to check on lunch, should I take that through for you?"Annie nodded and smiled as the older woman took the dish from her and left the room. Charlie went to speak to Mr Weasley, leaving Annie standing awkwardly in the middle of the room."Did my brother just bugger off and leave you?" Bill said, walking over to Annie, who laughed."Yep. He's left me in the belly of the beast," She smiled."Aw, it's not that bad. Food's pretty good," Bill reasoned and the two laughed. "Charlie was right, though. Trust Percy.""Be nice about your brother," Annie jokingly chided him.Mrs Weasley's voice echoed through the house, calling them to lunch. Annie exchanged some brief words with Mr Weasley, as well as being informed by Charlie that she would get quizzed about the muggle world.Percy was already sitting table, reading the Daily Prophet. He said a quick hello to Annie before she was swept away by Mr Weasley's questions. Sitting in between Mr Weasley and Charlie, Annie began to answer Mr Weasley's questions.During this, Bill sat opposite Charlie, leaving Mrs Weasley to sit opposite Annie, on the other side of Percy. The soup was served, with Mrs Weasley repeatedly offering Annie more bread and tea."You never do this for us, Mum!" Charlie grinned."Yeah, and we're your own flesh and blood!" Bill followed."Oh, hush now boys. Annie is a guest," Mrs Weasley said.They ended up splitting up into separate conversations, Mr Weasley and Percy discussing the Ministry, Charlie and Annie discussing the Triwizard Tournament and Bill and Mrs Weasley talking about the younger Weasleys."No, the Second Task was way harder!" Annie argued. "The First Task-""This is the girl Charlie knocked off her broom?!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed.Annie and Charlie slowly turned to look at a sheepish faced Bill and a slightly scary looking Mrs Weasley.Oh god, Annie thought. Just my bloody luck.Please review!

Okay then, just updating in a rush here. Hope you all like this chapter and I'm sorry about not updating until now. I think I'll make either Friday or Saturday my updating day, so then I won't have school to worry about. Thanks for all the lovely reviews, please, keep them coming! I'm going to go back and just tidy a few things up, okay?Please read, review and enjoy!I want to say a little something that's long overdue, the disrespect to women has got to be through. To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends, I wanna offer my love and respect till the end - Adam Yauch10th March Part 2"This is the girl Charlie knocked off her broom?!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed, her eyebrows raising dangerously high and her face began to redden, possibly in anger.Bill sat next to Mrs Weasley, sheepish look set on his face as the guilt shone in his eyes. He looked scared, as surprisingly, did Percy who was still sat on the other side of Mrs Weasley, his fork frozen halfway between his mouth and the table.Annie and Charlie shared a brief, panicked look that said everything. Both had been worried about how Mrs Weasley would react to finding out just who Annie was, but they had brushed it off, deciding it to be best to bury the matter. Bill, however, had not been told about this, and from the expression on his face, had unintentionally put his foot in it."What?" Charlie managed to stutter out. "I-I knocked Annie off her broom? Mum I'mâ€¦.Shocked you would even think that!"Mrs Weasley, who clearly saw through Charlie's terrible lie, sent him a look that quickly shut him up."Charlie," She said, dangerously low. "Is this the girl you knocked off her broom?""Well, Mum, it was fifth year and it's been quite some time-""Answer the question, Charlie!""Yes," Charlie said quickly, avoiding Mrs Weasley's eye. Annie, seeing Charlie's discomfort, slipped her hand into his under the table. He gave her a quick, grim smile, and they both turned to face Mrs Weasley.The red haired woman seemed to be deep in thought, though her eyes were glued to Charlie. Every so often, they would flicker over to Annie, making the girl fidget in nervousness. Mr Weasley kept trying to catch his wife's eye, but was unsuccessful."I think," Mrs Weasley said dangerously slow. "Bill and Percy should go into the sitting room while Arthur and I have a chat with Charlie and Annie."The two Weasley brothers did not need to be told twice. Bill shot the couple an apologetic look, before scampering out of the room behind Percy, closing the door behind him. Mr Weasley, looking rather grim, moved to sit next to his wife, shooting his son a brief look."So then," Mrs Weasley said, slowly. "I think we should start at the beginning. Charlie, would you like to tell me exactly what is going on?"Charlie sighed."Mum, do we really have to do this?""Yes""Okay then," Charlie said. "I've liked Annie since first year, ever since I first met her. But I was a bit of an arse to her-""Language!" Mrs Weasley chided."Sorry, Mum," Charlie said quickly. "Anyway, I was a bit mean to her and she kind of hated me after that. But, I still liked her. The Quidditch thing was a complete accident, honestly, I didn't realise she had already caught the snitch and I was going faster than I thought I was, so, you know. The next week, I was doing patrols with Annie and she hit her head off the vanishing step so I took her to the hospital wing. After that, I thought that I might have a chance with her. But she got a boyfriend and I insulted him so she started to hate me again.""In hindsight," Annie interrupted. "Chris was an arrogant, pompous idiot who cared about no one but himself."The three Weasleys turned to look at her and she shrugged."It's just the truth.""Okay, back to the story," Charlie continued. "So, we finished school and the World Cup was the first time we saw each other since. At the end of seventh year, we let bygones be bygones, but I still liked her. Seeing her at the World Cup brought it all back. So, at the Yule Ball, I kissed her.""When I was still dating Chris," Annie added and Charlie nodded."Needless to say, she wasn't too happy. She avoided me for the next month.""Then," Annie took over, giving Charlie a reassuring look. "Chris took me on the first date we had been on for years. Turns out, he had been offered a job in foreign affairs in the Ministry of Magic in Hong Kong. He wanted me to go with himâ€¦and he proposed. I said no.""Why?" Mrs Weasley asked."Because," Annie sighed. "I didn't love him. And he didn't love me. I think, once over, he did, but not for a long time. I barely ever saw him, he was that busy with work. And, when I did, thatâ€¦spark, that magic was just gone.""Chris didn't react well," Charlie said. "He called her some awful things, and was convinced that Annie saying no had something to do with me.""In a way, it did," Annie put in."What?!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed. "Charlie was the reason you broke up?""No!" Annie quickly said. "Merlin no. I was unhappy with Chris and kissing Charlie helped me to realise that.""So how did all this happen?" Mr Weasley asked, motioning towards Charlie and Annie. The two looked at each other, smiling slightly."Bill and Tonks," Charlie said. "They pushed us together, literally.""And that's everything," Annie said, Charlie giving her hand a reassuring squeeze."Yeah," Charlie agreed, turning to face Mrs Weasley. "That's everything, Mum."Mrs Weasley was silent, as was her husband. While Mr Weasley was waiting for his wife's probable outburst, Mrs Weasley was sitting quietly, deep in thought."I would like to speak to Annie on my own," She said quickly, after a short silence.Annie's eyes widened in nervousness and Charlie gripped her hand tighter. Mrs Weasley noticed this."Now, really, I simply want to talk with the girl, not hex her into oblivion!" Mrs Weasley cried.Mr Weasley stood up, and after giving his wife a pat on the back, headed towards the door, where he waited for Charlie. Said boy was still hovering around Annie, possibly thinking that in fifteen minutes time, he may not have a girlfriend."Come on, Charlie," Mr Weasley said.Sighing, Charlie rose from his seat and solemnly walked towards the door, his eyes flickering from Annie to his mother. Annie shot him a reassuring smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. She would rather go up against a Hungarian Horntail than face the wrath of an annoyed mother.The door shutting left the room in silence. Annie looked anywhere but at Mrs Weasley, while Mrs Weasley looked straight at her. Feeling nervous â€“ and very self-conscious â€“ Annie began to fiddle with her sleeves."You're muggle-born, aren't you, Annie?" Mrs Weasley said, breaking the silence."Yes, Mrs Weasley," Annie quickly replied. Mrs Weasley smiled."Don't look so frightened dear," Mrs Weasley said. "I just want to talk.""What about?"Mrs Weasley sighed and smiled at Annie."You remind me of someone, Annie," Mrs Weasley said. "She was unsure about her feeling for another boy, while she was dating another. She was scared, scared of rejection, of loneliness, of what everyone else would think. But in the end, she chose the other man.And she was happier with him. He made her feel safe, lovedâ€¦whole. The other man eventually found happiness with another, and while he was bitter about the break-up, he moved past it."Mrs Weasley took Annie's hand from across the table and smiled."What I'm trying to say, is that you remind me of myself.""The girl was you?" Annie asked, eyes widening in surprise. Mrs Weasley nodded."I wasn't always with Arthur, you know. Back in the day, I was quite the heart-breaker in Gryffindor Tower, or at least, that's what my brothers used to call me."Mrs Weasley stopped abruptly, hand shaking slightly. Annie saw this, and squeezed it."Mrs Weasley, I know what it's like to lose someone you're close to," She said quietly. "The heart-ache, it never goes away, does it? You've just got to face it, head on.""And make sure you have someone by your side," Mrs Weasley finished, smiling at Annie. "I don't think I need to ask you if you love Charlie, I can see it in your eyes. Not like those other girls he's brought home, they never fully understood my son. But you, Annie, you're different. You don't love in halves, you truly love those close to you.""Jane Austin," Annie smiled."Yes, I'm quite the fan of her books.""So was my Mum," Annie said quietly. Mrs Weasley nodded in understanding."So that's who you lost," She said and Annie nodded. "Annie, dear, just know, you can talk to me at any time. Charlie and the others may not fully understand; they've never lost someone like that. I have. If you need any help at all, someone to talk to or even just someone to be a mother, I am here."Annie sniffled, and brushed away a stray tear."Thank you," She whispered.â€¦..Charlie paced across the living room while Percy had his head buried in a book and Bill and Mr Weasley chatted in the corner. How could they be so calm? His mother could be murdering his girlfriend at this point and they were talking about bloody Quidditch!"Excuse me?" Charlie said loudly, catching the attention of the other Weasleys present. "I'd appreciate if you didn't discuss whether or not the Appleby Arrows will win the semi-finals when Mum could possibly be turning Annie into a toad!""Calm down, Charlie," Mr Weasley said. "Your Mum's not going to do that. I think she likes Annie.""What makes you think that?" Charlie asked. "She barely said a word before!""Believe me, Charlie, it's better that way," Bill told him. "Remember when I brought Annabel Hopkins home? Mum was shouting at her before we'd even had pudding."Charlie sighed and flopped into an armchair and ran a hand though his hair."I really hope this works out," He said."It will," His father reassured him. "Don't worry."Knowing his father was probably right, Charlie relaxed slightly. You're just being stupid, he told himself. Mum'll love Annie, she will. She is NOT hexing her into oblivion.The sound that rang from the kitchen did not put his mind at ease.Shooting up, Charlie ran into the kitchen, ignoring his brother's and father's protests. Mum's killing Annie! Oh Merlin, I should have never left them alone!Bursting into the kitchen, nothing could have prepared him for the sight that greeted him.Annie and his Mother were sat next to each other, looking though a photo album. It was open on his baby photos and they were both laughing at them."And this one is when he decided wanted to fly so he jumped off the top of the shed, broom in hand, shouting 'I can fly'!" Mrs Weasley laughed. "And this one was when-""What's going on?" Charlie exclaimed, causing the two women to look up at him, both with Cheshire cat grins plastered on their faces."Oh Charlie, we were just talking about you," Mrs Weasley said, looking back at the book."Your Mum was just showing me some photos," Annie smiled mischievously. "And may I say, you looked especially cute when Ginny decided to dress you up as a fairy princess."Charlie felt his face redden, partly from embarrassment, and partly from relief.Even though his mother and girlfriend were going through photo albums of Charlie in his younger days, it was a millions times better than them killing each other."Oh, isn't he so cute in this one?" Mrs Weasley cried.Okay, maybe not that much better.Annie seemed to sense his discomfort so got up and walked over to him. She kiss him and wrapped her arms around him."If it makes you feel any better," She began. "You still have to meet my Dad. That's something you should be scared about."Please review!

Yeah, so I was going to post this tomorrow but because I now have to work, you get it now. Because of this, I am really sorry if it feels rushed and if there's any mistakes. I've had to rush it.On a brighter note, I have five offers from Uni! Yeah, just had to tell someone. Anyway, just ignore my craziness. Story's going pretty well, I hope you all like this chapter! It's pretty long too!Please read, review and enjoy!We are infected by our own misunderstanding of how our own minds work - Kevin Kelly17th March 1995Annie sat on the couch, book in hand and Jasper curled up next to her. While she may have her own rooms at Hogwarts, she still like to come home to her flat on the weekends she was not needed. Jasper kneed her leg, clearly wanting attention, so Annie placed her cup of tea and book on the table."What's up, Jazz?" She asked. "Am I too boring for your taste?"Jasper meowed back, almost in reply, jumped off the couch and walked over to the door, where he promptly sat and look at it."Now what?" Annie said.The cat gave a yowl. Annie shook her head and went to continue reading, when there was a knock at the door. She sighed."Bloody cat, always seems to know everything," She muttered. Giving a loud sigh, she stood up and walked over to the door, past the cat that seemed to be grinning smugly. She opened the door and smiled."Hey, Charlie," Annie greeted. Charlie grinned back."Hello, my beautiful girlfriend," He grinned. Annie frowned playfully."Aw, now my greeting sounds rubbish."Charlie laughed."I know a way you could make up for it," He said, making Annie grinned. She leaned forward and kissed him. After a minute, they broke away, both smiling."Its official, my greeting was the best," Annie grinned. "Now, do you want a cup of tea?""Please. It's March and it's still freezing," Charlie commented."That's because you've gotten used to the Romanian climate while the rest of us are stuck wearing jumpers though till May," Annie said.The redhead laughed and took a on the couch while Annie quickly made him a cup of tea. Sitting next to her boyfriend, Annie sipped at her own tea."So then, what are we doing today?" Charlie asked."Sleeping," Annie said, resting her head on Charlie's shoulder. "Kids today have too much energy."Charlie laughed and let his arm dangle over her shoulder, hugging her close."Okay, then," He said. "We can stay in."Annie nodded and she could feel her eyelids get heavier as she curled up next to Charlie. With a smile on her face, she had just began to drift off when there was a tapping at the window. Both Annie and Charlie looked up to see an owl sitting on the windowsill outside. Annie groaned but got up. She opened the window and the Barn owl hopped in and stuck out his leg, which a letter was tied to."Thanks, Jupiter," Annie said to the owl as she untied the letter. The owl hooted in reply, and Annie fed him a treat."What does Dad want at this time?" Annie muttered as she opened the letter.Charlie watched as Annie read the letter, her eyes widening as she read further. She muttered something under her breath which Charlie did not catch, before streaking over a cupboard, where she grabbed a piece of parchment, quill and ink. She quickly scribbled a reply and tied the letter to Jupiter's leg."Good boy," Annie said as the owl flew back out of the window. She then turned to face Charlie, who was still sat on the couch, looking very confused."I am so sorry, Charlie, but I have to go," She quickly said, grabbing her jacket off the coat rack."What's going on?" He asked, standing up. Annie shook her head while she tried to pull her shoes on."Just, Dad. Family stuff, you know?"Although Annie was not looking at him, Charlie could tell from the sound of her voice that she was lying."Okay," He said slowly, walking over to a struggling Annie. "You know, it helps when you put shoes on the right feet," He said to Annie who was having difficulty. She blushed and quickly corrected herself."Look, I'm really sorry," She apologised. "But I really need to go.""Its fine," Charlie waved it off. "Get yourself away. Do you want me to lock up?"Annie visibly relaxed."Would you? That would be great," She smiled, leaning up to kiss his cheek. "Thank you so much."Charlie smiled as she disapperated, leaving her alone in the empty apartment.He knew what he was about to do next was wrong. But he couldn't help it. Walking over to the windowsill where the letter was still laying, he picked it up and began to read it.Dear Annie,So sorry to bother you, but could you please go pick up Ciaran from the train station? I know it's really short notice, but we're swamped here. Best pop by here first to get the car â€“ after all, I don't know how he'll react to finding out you're a witch, having known you so long!You're still coming round for tea, aren't you? He was so looking forward to seeing you again!See you soon,DadCharlie lowered the letter, and was very confused. Who in Merlin's name was Ciaran? Annie had never mentioned a Ciaran, and apparently she had known him for a while. Thoughts that he didn't like one bit filled his head as he walked over to the fireplace."Nymphadora Tonks' flat!" He said, throwing a handful of green Floo Powder into the fire and placing his head in.Instantly, his head was looking through the fireplace at Tonks' flat. The girl in question was sitting at a desk, hair now long and black, and was busy writing."Tonks!" Charlie called, catching her attention. She turned round and grinned."Wotcher, Charlie," Tonks greeted, walking over and sitting in front of the fireplace. "Everything alright?""Tonks, do you know someone called Ciaran?" Charlie asked, his voice quick and slightly panicky.Tonks looked deep in thought for a minute."Nope, doesn't ring a bell," She replied. "Why?"Charlie sighed."Annie got a letter from her Dad, asking if she could go pick someone called Ciaran from the train station-""-And you're jealous because she didn't tell you who Ciaran is," Tonks finished, causing Charlie to frown. She shrugged. "I'm good at reading people.""Anywayâ€¦" Charlie said. "I was just wondering if you knew who this guy was. Not because I'm jealous though.""Sure," Tonks said. "You're jealous. That's it. But I have an idea that will help.""What is it?" Charlie asked.A mischievous glint appeared in Tonks' twinkling eyes."Oh, Mr Weasley. You're going to find out just exactly what makes me such a good Auror!"â€¦"I still can't believe we're doing this," Charlie said from behind the muggle newspaper he was holding up.The two where sat inside Newcastle Train Station, hiding behind newspapers and waiting for Annie. The station was busy, with passengers rushing from platform to station while trying to dodge suitcases and other luggage on wheels."You where the one who wanted to find out who this Ciaran was!" Tonks exclaimed. "Got any better ideas?"Charlie huffed but did not reply."Exactly," Tonks replied smugly."I still don't get why we had to bring you Dad's car," Charlie muttered.Before the two had arrived at the station, Tonks and shrunk her father's car, and had enlarged it in a back alley just outside of the station."How else do you expect us to follow them?" Tonks demanded. "I've thought it all out, when Annie and Ciaran head off to her Dad's house, we follow them in the car.""Why can't we just apperate?" Charlie asked. "It would be easier!""Because!" Tonks exclaimed. "It takes an hour to get from the station to Annie's Dad's house and unless you want to spend an hour with her Dad, this is the best idea I've got!"Charlie slammed the newspaper against his knees."Can you even drive?" He demanded. Tonks turned to face him."Yes! Of course I can! I mean, I may have a bit trouble with using the wing mirror but a super sensory charm works just as well!"Charlie opened his mouth to reply when Tonks' eyes widened and she pushed his head down."It's Annie!" She hissed.Charlie quickly hid behind his newspaper again, his eyes quickly landing on an article about something called 'EastEnders'. Hesitantly, he looked round the newspaper where he saw Annie standing next to the ticket barrier a little way off, looking nervous and very muggle-like."So where do you think he is?" Tonks whispered to him.Just then, a shout of 'Annie!' could be heard. Both Charlie and Tonks looked over their newspapers to see a young, blonde haired man jogging over towards Annie, large duffle bag in hand. A large grin broke out on Annie's face at the sight of the man and she brought him into a hug he when he reached her. They broke away and Annie kissed his cheek, his arm still around her shoulders.Both Charlie and Tonks was stunned to the point where they were in silence.Dear Merlin, Charlie thought. She's got another boyfriend! She's cheating on me! Well, she's cheating on him with me, but still!Beside him, Tonks' face reflected his and Charlie could tell she was thinking similar things. They both watched in disbelief as Annie and Ciaran walked out of the station, Ciaran's arm still around Annie, chattering away. Charlie couldn't hear what they were saying but Annie laughed and it made him feel horrible.Tonks quickly stood up."Come on," She told Charlie. "She's not getting away that easily."Charlie nodded and followed the girl out of the train station, weaving in between the muggles while keeping their distance from Annie. By some stroke of luck, Annie's car was parked near to theirs so they easily followed them out of Newcastle.They managed to get on to the A1 with ease while still being at a distance where they could see the red Mini Annie was driving. It was half an hour since they had left the station when either of them began to speak."So, do you know what you're going to say to her?" Tonks asked."Ask her why she's cheated on me, I guess," Charlie replied in a quiet voice. Tonks frowned."Something's not right here. It's not like Annie," She said."Well what am I supposed to do?!" Charlie exclaimed, startling Tonks. "The girl I've liked since first year is cheating on me! I don't know what I should be doing!"Tonks seemed to shrink slightly while Charlie continued with his rant."She was the only girl I thought I'd settle down with! Yeah, I've dated other girls but none of them ever made me feel the same was she did. So, unless you've got a time turner so I can go back and save myself a lot of heart ache, I don't want to hear it."An uncomfortable silence fell upon the car and Charlie fumed in silence. Until Tonks, in a very quiet voice, spoke up."Actions speak louder than words."While Charlie appreciated Tonks' help, he still kept quiet."Let's put some music on," Tonks muttered. "It's too quiet in this car."She switched on the radio, and Eye of the Tiger blared out from the speakers. Tonks, despite everything, began laughing, earning a questioning look of Charlie."Sorry, but I think it's exactly what we need," She said and was met with more confusion. "It's supposedly a really inspiring song."Charlie shook his head and managed a smile, before going back to staring out of the window, wondering why a song about a tiger's eye was motivational.â€¦This was it. He was ready. He was ready to burst through the door and rebuff Annie in front of 'Ciaran' and her farther. He kept replaying the scene at the train station over and over again in his head, using it as a motivator. It felt similar to what he would do before a big Quidditch match.Then a small thought at the back of his head stopped these thoughts.Would she really cheat on you?Charlie pushed this to one side, however. He knew what he saw and what he had saw was Annie with another man. He had to do this. No matter how bad he felt."Ready?" Tonks said from behind him.Charlie nodded and with a sigh, Tonks opened the back door that led up to the rooms above the pub. Tonks had told him that the stairs led straight into the living room, where Annie was mostly likely to be.He could do this.He moved towards the stairs but hesitated. Tonks saw this."I don't think I can do this," He said quietly, hanging his head. Tonks smiled slightly and nodded."I get it," She said. "And believe me, you'll thank me for this someday."Charlie frowned just as he saw a black blur streak past him. It took him two seconds to comprehend what was happening and another two to reach the bottom step. By this time, Tonks was already half way up the stairs. Charlie swore under his breath as he ran after the girl but by the time he had reached half way, Tonks was bursting into the room."No, Annie, you can't cheat on Charlie!" Tonks shouted, just as Charlie reached her. Nothing could have prepared him for the sight that met him.Annie was sat at a dining table, fork frozen halfway to her mouth. Next to her, sat who Charlie assumed to be her father, and opposite was Ciaran. Next to Ciaran, however, was a little boy who looked no older than four. With the exception of the little boy, the looks on the adults' faces ranged from confusion to amusement to embarrassment (Annie).Everyone was still. No one moved."What in Merlin's name are you on about, Tonks?" Annie asked, her eyes flickering from Tonks to Charlie."Hello again, Tonks," William greeted, though he still looked confused. "And who's your friend?""Oh god," Annie groaned, resting her head in her hands. "Ciaran, this is my friend Tonks. Dad, meet Charlie. My boyfriend.""Boyfriend?" Ciaran asked. "You sure know how to pick them, Annie!""Now, hang on a minute!" Charlie exclaimed. "I've got a bone to pick with you! Annie, are you cheating on me with him?""What?!" Annie cried, as did William and Ciaran."God, that's disgusting!" Ciaran grimaced."Hey!""What the bloody hell is going on?!" Charlie said loudly, earning him three glares."Language!" William, Annie, and surprisingly, Ciaran exclaimed as they all looked at the little boy, who had gotten bored and had begun to play with a toy car."Oh for goodness sake," Annie cried. "Charlie, Tonks, this is my cousin, Ciaran!"That put a stop to Charlie's thoughts."What?" Charlie asked."My cousin. Ciaran." Annie repeated. "And his son, Ewan.""Wait, so you're not cheating on Charlie?" Tonks asked."No!" Annie exclaimed.Tonks sighed in relief and cuffed Charlie on the head."See! I told you it wasn't like her!""How about we all just calm down and have a cup of tea?" William said calmly. "And we'll discuss this, rationally."A few minutes later, all the adults where sat around the table, mugs of tea in hand, while Ewan was laughing away at a programme on the TV."Okay, then," Annie began. "Tonks, Charlie, this is my cousin, Ciaran, and his son, Ewan. He's going to be helping Dad with the restaurant for a while.""Why didn't you tell me you were going to pick up your cousin?" Charlie asked.Now that he had calmed down, it was clear that they were cousins. They looked similar, both with similar hues of blonde hair and a light splash of freckles which where only noticeable when he looked closely."Because, you were going to meet Dad next week, anyway! I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and have you meet both at once!""It's nice to meet you, anyway," Ciaran smiled. "Has Annie ever told you about the time-""Don't you dare!" Annie cried, making Ciaran grin.Tonks and Ciaran began talking, no doubt discussing the various embarrassing things Annie had done over the years, while Annie leaned over to Charlie."He doesn't know about us," She said and Charlie understood what she meant. "I'm not going to tell him, not yet that is. He's come to stay because his wife's just left him. He needs my Dad."Charlie nodded. Annie went to play with Ewan and William appeared in her empty seat."I guess I don't have to give you the 'you-hurt-my-daughter-I'll-hurt-you-speech', do I?" He asked."No, sir," Charlie replied and William nodded."Good," William said. He looked at Charlie. "You're different to him, you know.""Who, sir?"William chuckled."William is fine, Charlie. I mean Chris. I never liked him, I only said I did to make Annie happy. He had this horrible aura around him. Seemed very stuck up, if you ask me. But I think you're different.""Thank you, sir- I mean William.""But if you do hurt her, I will break every bone in our body, wizard or not," William threatened, but seemed calm about it.Charlie managed a nervous nod."Hey, Charlie!" Ciaran shouted from across the room, a photo album resting on his lap. "Come see this picture of Annie when she did ballet!""No!" Annie shrieked. "Not that one!"Charlie saw the photo and laughed. A young Annie was glaring at the camera, dressed in a pink leotard and tutu. From next to him, Annie groaned."I hate bringing a boyfriend home," She muttered.Please review!

Super sorry about the late update! But MerryE Christmas! Seriously sorry though, my laptop broke so I've had to type This off of my phone. Sorry about any mistakes! Hopefully, I'll update again in a few days! Thanks and please review! Every man is wise when attacked by a mad dog; fewer when pursued by a mad woman; only the wisest survive when attacked by a mad notion- Robertson Davis24th May 1995Annie groaned as she fell on to the couch, tired from her day in the Hospital Wing. It had been a busy day, with three children coming down with flu , as well as several fifth year students being admitted with severe cases of stress due to their upcoming O. . One girl in particular, needed double the dosage of calming draught because of breaking down a second time, and accident transforming a shelfful of potions into a dozen snakes (Annie was the one who had to catch them all, too).There was a tap at the window and Annie reshuffled herself on the couch into a position where she could see the window. Outside of the glass sat Gulliver, Charlie's Eagle-Owl. A letter was tied to his leg, so with a large sigh, Annie got to her feet and opened the window. The bird flew in and perched himself of the back of a chair, giving a hoot as Annie fed him a treat. She quickly untied the letter, opened the parchment and began to read the letter.Dear Annie,A big Hello from Romania! I'm so sorry I'll be away for your birthday, but guess what! I've definitely got time off for the Third Task! Isn't that great?Anyway, I hope things are going well at work, my brothers aren't giving you any hassle, are they? And by brothers, I mean Fred and George. Ron goes all shy around girls (did you hear about when he tried to ask Fleur Delacour to the Yule Ball?) and I think Ginny would hex anyone who bothered you â€“ the twins included!Hope your Dad's alright, and Ciaran's doing okay at the restaurant. Tell little Ewan that his drawing of us was very nice but that my skin isn't orange, it's just the freckles.I should be back maybe in time for your birthday? With any luck that is. The Welsh Green that was used in the First Task has just hatched three babies. It sounds cute, but it's not when she's trying to burn your hair off for trying to check on them.So, your birthday? I was thinking we could go for dinner somewhere, make a night of it. It's not everyday you turn twenty two! And don't roll your eyes at me, it's your birthday, we have to make a fuss. Wait until my Mum finds out, that will be eventful!See you in a few weeks!Love, CharlieP.S. You are going to love your present!Annie smiled and placed the letter on the table. Trust Charlie to make a big fuss over her birthday. While Annie was happy with just a cosy night in, Charlie was determined to make it special, using the excuse that this was the first real occasion they were spending together. Her relationship with Charlie was completely different to what her relationship with Chris had been like.Charlie made an effort over the smallest occasion, whereas Chris struggled to make it home for dinner on time. He had even forgotten their anniversary, worked late and had left her sitting at home in a brand new dress, with the stone cold meal Annie had prepared and the candles burnt down to nothing.Thinking about Charlie brought a smile to her lips. She was lucky to have him, she realised. Her Father approved of him too, which further helped her relationship. Lots of people had pointed out how much happier she seemed in the last few months. Tonks had laughed and said a million times, 'I told you so!'. While Annie could only laugh at her best friend's antics, she was grateful for her role in forming her relationship with Charlie.She was happy too. Charlie was everything she had ever dreamed off, and much more. Though they were still in the 'early days' of their relationship, she felt at ease with him. She could be herself in front of Charlie, unlike when she was with Chris and was expected to fulfil the role of a stay-at-home housewife.Her thoughts were broken by the chime of the clock above the fireplace. Eight chimes told her it was eight o'clock. She sighed, and ran a hand over her hair, smoothing down her messy French Braid."Jasper!" She called, walking over to the kitchenette and picking up the cat's dish. "Jasper, tea time!"Annie was greeted with silence. Granted, she was not expecting a reply, but she usually heard the pitter-patter of Jasper's paws against the stone floor. Frowning, she walked into the living area of her Hogwarts Rooms."Jasper!" She said again. "Where are you, you silly cat?"She searched the whole area, but Annie could not find Jasper anywhere in her rooms."Bloody cat's probably gone walk about near Hagrid's again," Annie frowned. She gave a sigh, changed out of her work robes and into jeans and a jumper, pulled on her trainers and slipped her wand into her jacket pocket.Annie walked through the castle, greeting the odd pupil she passed. She had heard from Madam Pomfrey that the Champions where being told about the third task that night. As she passed Ludo Bagman, dressed in his usual brightly coloured Wimborne Wasps robes, she concluded that it was true.Her attention was caught by the Quidditch Pitch as she passed it. Low walls of hedges were growing in every direction, forming a distorted maze. Annie stopped for a minute, her eyes wide as saucers, as she studied the field in surprise. As a devoted Quidditch fan, she was shocked to see the pitch where she had practiced and played Quidditch for seven years, was no longer smooth and playable.After a minute of staring, she snapped out of her thoughts, remembering she had a cat to look for. Annie hurried along, glancing at the pitch one final time, before walking off in the direction of Hagrid's hut. The powder-blue Beauxbatons' carriage came into view, standing on the edge of the Forbidden Forest and next to Hagrid's pumpkin patch."Jasper!" Annie called. The lights weren't on in Hagrid's hut, otherwise Annie would have asked Hagrid for help. "Jasper!"A twig snapped behind Annie, from somewhere in the forest. Annie jumped in shock, before whirling round. Nothing was there."Hello?" She called, slowly walking towards the forest. "Is someone there?"Another twig snapped. Annie was torn, should she go in? It may have just been a bird or an animal, but then again, it could have been a student. As a member of staff, she had to make sure that the students were safe.Her footsteps were slow and hesitant; if it was a student, it was most likely to be one of the younger years and the last thing she wanted was to scare them off. Annie took a deep breath, her hand wrapping around her wand, just in case. She walked further into the Forbidden Forest, her wand raised up in front of her. She quickly muttered lumos, casting light into the dark Forest.There was another snap of a twig, this time from behind her. Annie whipped round, again to see nothing. She was starting to get scared now. There were a lot of dark creatures in the Forest, after all. Who in their right mind wouldn't be scared.Annie heard footsteps approaching from behind, spinning round again. Her eyes fell upon a figure that staggered out from within the trees and Annie's eyes widened in surprise."Mr Crouch?" She stuttered. The man looked deranged, robes ripped and face panicked. He appeared to be muttering something under his breath, but when his eyes landed on Annie, they widened, terror and panic filling them."Sariah? Sariah!" Me Crouch shouted, grabbing hold of Annie. The girl tried to break free of the old man's arms, but his grip was like iron and he would not let go."Mr Crouch, please let me go!" Annie cried. Mr Crouch just looked at the blonde, a feral hint in his eyes. Annie could feel the tears springing to her eyes. "Please, you're hurting me."The old man looked at her, and something glimmered in his eyes. He let go of Annie, and resumed muttering. Annie gasped for breath, scared by what had just happened. She looked over at the disheveled old man, unsure of what to do, deciding that taking him to Dumbledore would be best."Mr Crouch?" She said warily, as though he was a caged animal about to attack. "I'm going to take you to see Professor Dumbledore."Mr Crouch turned to face Annie, and for a second, fear filled his eyes. Then, he turned and ran further into the dark forest."Mr Crouch!" Annie shouted after the old man, before sighing. She really didn't need this. Another twig snapped from behind and she spun around. All Annie saw was a sliver of blonde hair and a flash of red, before the light engulfed her and she fell to the ground, unconscious.When Annie began to wake up, she could tell she was being carried by someone. Her legs gently swung as her head lolled to one side. Whoever was carrying her, she was very thankful for it. The person stopped, and Annie could vaguely make out voices, but they were to disorientated to make sense. She moaned slightly, and tried to open her eyes."She's waking up now, Professor Dumbledore, sir," Hagrid's voice rang through Annie's ears. She stirred slightly, slowly waking herself up. Hagrid must be carrying me, Annie thought to herself as she tried to wake herself up faster. Her eyes felt like weights as she struggled to open then, and when they fluttered open, she saw tree leaves above her."What happened?" Annie managed to moan out, looking from Hagrid, to Professor Dumbledore who was stood next the the giant, to Harry, and Krum, and Karkaroff, who was glaring at Dumbledore."We were hoping you could tell us, Miss Ainswoth," Professor Dumbledore said calmly"I-I can't really remember," Annie said nervously, aware that everyone was watching her. "All I can remember is that I was in the forest, Mr Crouch appeared, half-mad, he ran away and then," Annie trailed off, looking at her hands. "I think I must have been stunned, I can remember seeing red light."Dumbledore nodded, his expression somber."Yes, you were stunned. Can you remember anything that Mr Crouch said? Anything that might lead us to him?" He asked."He, um, said a name," Annie said slowly, fiddling with her sleeves. "â€¦My mother's name, actually. He kept saying 'Sariah', before he ran off into the forest.""Did you see anyone else?" Dumbledore asked, his gaze completely focused on Annie. "A student, perhaps, or a member of staff?""No, Professor Dumbledore," Annie said, shaking her head. "I can't remember seeing anyone else."As Annie trailed off, Dumbledore nodded his head, before looking up at Hagrid, his eyes briefly darting over to Harry."Please kindly escort Harry and Miss Ainsworth back up to the castle, Hagrid," He asked the giant. Hagrid's eyes darted over to Karkaroff, who he glared at with dislike."Maybe I'd best stay here, Headmaster..." Hagrid began."You will take these two back to school, Hagrid," Dumbledore said firmly. "Take Miss Ainsworth to the hospital wing, and Harry to Gryffindor Tower. And I want the two if you to stay there," Dumbledore turned his focus to Annie and Harry. "Anything you might want to do â€“ any owls you might want to send â€“ they can wait until morning, do you understand me?"They both nodded, Harry even managing to force out a yes. Hagrid, still glaring at Karkaroff, told the Headmaster that Fang would stay with him, as he was clearly wary of the Dumstrang Headmaster. The trio, Annie still in Hagrid's arms, then marched out of the forest, past the Beauxbatons carriage, and up towards the castle. Hagrid began to talk to Harry â€“ the anger clear in his voice â€“ about Karkaroff. Clearly something had happened before Annie woke up."Krum's all right!" Harry exclaimed as Hagrid got on the topic of just why Harry had been in the forest. They began to walk up the steps of the Entrance Hall, before turning up towards the hospital wing. "He wasn't trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione -""I'd be havin' a few word with he, an' all," Hagrid said, grim tone to his voice. Annie frowned."Cut the lad some slack, Hagrid," She said. "He didn't know what would happen.""An' that's another thing!" Hagrid exclaimed. "Jus' what were yeh doin', in the forest this time a' night? You ought yet know better, Annie!""I was just looking for my bloody cat!" She replied. "I didn't know I would end up being bloody stunned!"Hagrid hmph'ed, clearly annoyed by the two's recklessness."I don' know," He said. "Your Charlie'll 'ave me head soon, lettin' this happen. Gonna have to keep a closer eye on yer, both of yer!"They reached the doors of the hospital wing and Hagrid stopped, Harry soon the same."Well, her' we are," Hagrid said, looking down at the blonde. "You'd best not get yoursel' in ter anymore trouble, do ya here me?"Annie smiled and leaned up, giving Hagrid a quick kiss on the cheek, making him blush slightly."Thanks, Hagrid," she smiled, as he gently put her down. She turned to Harry. "You be careful now, okay? Remember what Dumbledore told you."Harry managed a small smile and nodded, making Annie smile slightly."Good lad," She said. "Goodnight," she said to the two, before opening the hospital wing door and hoping Madam Pomfrey wouldn't kill her.

Happy New Year! Hopefully I'll post another chapter today, but only time will time!I am very pleased to celebrate this story's first birthday, that's one whole year(365 days) on fanfiction and can I say, it has been a great year! This story means everything to me and it would be nothing without all your lovely feedback so keep it coming!Read and enjoy! And have a great New Year!â€¦..Sending a handwritten letter is becoming such an anomaly. It's disappearing. My mom is the only one who still writes me letters. And there's something visceral about opening a letter - I see her on the page. I see her in her handwriting â€“ Steve Carelllâ€¦..25th May 1995Dear Annie,Are you okay?! Ron mentioned in his letter that you were attacked; were you going to tell me? You are okay, aren't you? Why the bloody hell did Crouch attack you? He's mental! Percy's feeling really bad, the Ministry's questioning him because of Crouch's disappearance; they reckon he should have seen something was wrong. But you know Percy, give him some power and he won't say no to it.He sends his love, as does Mum and Dad. Mum says you have to come round for lunch sometime. Bill's back in Egypt, but he says he could be back for the third task. So that'll be me, Bill and Mum. It'll be a fun day!Hope work's alright!Love,Charlie25th May 1995Dear Charlie,I am fine! Honestly, you'd think I'd been landed in St Mungo's the way people have been going on! I was only stunned, nothing serious! Oh, and I'm going to kill your brother for mentioning it, I told him and Harry not to bother you!Tell your Mum I can come round for tea on the 2nd, if that's okay. That's my next day off. Yes, work is mostly fine. Except, the majority of fifth-years seem to be having mental breakdowns and guess who has to administer the calming draughts? Our year weren't as bad as this! I can't remember one person losing it â€“ well, except Barry Highmore, but he was never fully with it anyway!One thing is bothering me though. Mr Crouch, in between talking to the tree,'Weatherby' (I think he thought it was Percy), heâ€¦ Well, he kept calling me 'Sariah', which was my Mum's name. I know Crouch was stark-raving mad at the time, but it still creeps me out a must just be a coincidence, right? I mean, there must be hundreds of Sariahs' in England alone.Anyway, I have to go now; there's another fifth-year whose managed to transform her nose into a trunk. See you on Wednesday!Love,Annie25th May 1995Dear Annie,I can't believe you weren't going to tell me you'd been attacked! I mean, I'm your best friend, for Merlin's sake! Official annoyed.But how are you?! Who do I need to hurt? When I get my hands on Crouchâ€¦. Why would he attack you like that? It's not like you would attack him, or even look like you would attack him. You can't even hurt a fly, for the sake of Merlin!Don't you roll your eyes at me, Annie Lauryn Ainsworth! I know you, you won't like how people are making a fuss and you'll just be saying you're fine when your really not. You've done that since we were bloody eleven! Remember the time during Quidditch practice, when you took a bludger to the head and managed to convince us all you were alright? Not one hour later, you'd collapsed and spent the remainder of the weekend in the hospital wing. Or was it during a match? Whatever, it just proves my point!So then, bestie, what are you and lover boy doing for your birthday? The big double two, it has to be something special! He'd better treat you right, especially since I'm once step closer to passing my Auror exams! Might die during the process though, but at least I tried!Take it easy, Ainsworth!Love,TonksP.S. I may have told your Dad. Expect the muggle version of a howler soon.25th May 1995Dear Tonks,I wasn't going to tell you because I'm seeing you on Saturday! And I knew you'd react like this! You're worse than Charlie, and he was pretty bad.You told my DAD! Are you mentally insane?! Kiss goodbye to my life, because I am a dead woman. Dad'll never want me to come back to Hogwarts now, the over-protective fool. Merlin, please say him and Charlie won't team up and lock me away in a room for the next fifty years, I don't think I could handle it!Anyway, this is just a quick note because the hospital wing is packed with bloody fifth years who are in the middle of mental breakdowns. And because I'm the lovely healer I am, it's my duty to take care of them. Wish me luck!Love,Annie25th May 1995Dear Annie,I am bearing in mind that you have probably already received similar letters to this, but you were attacked?! Forgive me for being the anxious parent that I am, but who would attack you like that? And at Hogwarts, too? I thought it was one of the safest places in the Wizard World.Of course, we're all worried about you. Enclosed are letters from Ciaran and little Ewan, he's even drawn a picture! They've both settled in wonderfully, Ewan's now going to playground and has made lots of friends!I'll leave you now, I expect you'll be very busy with the exams season. Say what you will, but you and Tonks were complete messes when you were sitting yours!Lots of love,Dad25th May 1995Dear little Cousin,Hope you're alright! Uncle William said you'd had an accident at work or something? And that the only way to contact you was by letter. Have you not got a telephone up in Scotland?How's the boyfriend treating you? If you need him hurt, just say the words. Kidding! But, like Uncle William says, if he hurts you, I'll hurt him!Ewan loves it here, says it's a lot nicer than Manchester. And cleaner. He also has a strange fascination with the some of the stuff in your room. He nicked one of your teddies and I put it on the top shelf â€“ it is yours, after all â€“ and not five mintues later, he's got it in his arms! Very strange.Anyway, here's Ewan now. He feels like such a big boy writing a letter to you!DeAr Anyi,Mis u loTs, DaddiEs no fun cOs he woNt let me pLay wIth yoorr teddies. The dog a cros the road is nise hes big an flufy! R u conim hom sooon? Unce Wiliam isnt as goood at strory tim as you!Loots of loove,EwanAnd Ciaran.P.S. Ewan's going to be a world class writer someday, isn't he!25th May 1995Dear Dad,Yes, I'm bloody fine! Honesty if I had a sickle for every time someone asked me that (sorry, I mean penny) I'd be a millionaire by now! The man who attacked me wasn't very well, mentally that is. There's going to be a big enquiry about it, if that puts your mind at ease. Don't worry, Hogwarts is safe again!It's good to hear that Ciaran and Ewan are all settled in, I especially like Ewan's letter! Sorry, but this is only a quick letter as I am very busy at work and everyone has picked today to owl me!Lots of love,AnnieP.S. And I will have you know that I was not as bad as these fifth years!25th May 1995Dear Ciaran and Ewan,It's nice to hear from you! I hope you like country living. Ciaran, the most exciting time of your adult life will be running into a field full of cows (which, for the record, can be quite scary at one in the morning. Don't ask me how I know that!)Ewan, your letter was lovely! Tell Daddy that I don't know what he's talking about and to stop doubting others! The dog further down the lane, the big sheepdog called Max, he'sively too! I miss you too, kiddo. I'll be home soon though!Have to go, you know what hormonal teenagers are like!Love,Annie
