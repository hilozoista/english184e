Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.Thirteen year old Harry Potter sighed as he cleaned the kitchen counters. He had already cleaned them twice but his Aunt Petunia had insisted it wasn't clean enough. She was always been picky but she was exceptionally so as Uncle Vernon's sister Marge was coming to stay for a few days. Harry hated Aunt Marge. She was just as mean and spiteful as Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and Dudley. He couldn't wait to be done so he could hide upstairs and look through the birthday gifts Hedwig had brought him at midnight. Hermione had given him a broomstick servicing kit and Ron had given him a Sneakoscope that was supposed to light up if someone dodgy was around. Hagrid had sent him an interesting gift. A book called The Monster Book of Monster which had almost bitten his hand off.Harry finished the counters and then stood back to wait for Aunt Petunia to inspect it. Again. He absentmindedly rubbed his side where Dudley had kicked him after pushing him down yesterday. He was already counting down the days until he could go back to his real home which was Hogwarts. Harry would rather be there cleaning Snape's dungeon with a toothbrush than to be in this house.Aunt Petunia came up beside him and inspected the sparkling counters. "I suppose this will have to do." She pursed her lips which made Harry always thought made her look like a horse. "The living room could use another once over.""But I already-"Harry stopped. Really, what was the point? "Fine. I'll go clean the living room. Again.""Watch your manners boy!" Aunt Petunia glared hatefully at her nephew. "Unless you would like a week with no food? And that will include your annoying owl as well!"Harry gritted his teeth against all the things he would like to tell his Aunt. He simply nodded and did as she asked. He didn't want to risk going yet another week without food as it seemed every other week he was being punished with barely any food at all. He decided to send Hedwig to the Burrow for the summer. He liked having her with him as she was the only company he had during the summers but he couldn't risk her starving or worse. Uncle Vernon had threatened to shoot her more than once.Harry pretended to pick up the living room as there was nothing to pick up. He was fluffing the pillows when Uncle Vernon walked in. "All right boy, Marge should be arriving any minute. No freakiness better happen while she is here or else." He narrowed his beady eyes at Harry.Harry took a deep breath. He had a reason to try and be polite besides not wanting to get hit or starved. Professor McGonagall had sent him a permission slip for Hogsmeade as third years were allowed to go. "I wanted to ask a favor Uncle Vernon. I was given a permission slip for a field trip at Hog- school and I was wondering if you would sign it." Harry wasn't stupid. He knew that in any other scenario his relatives would refuse to sign but as Marge would be here, he figured it was an angle he could work. "If I knew I was going to get to go on the field trip I'm sure it would stop any, um, freaky things from happening."Uncle Vernon opened his mouth to say no but then thought about it. He really didn't want his sister to know how much of a freak his nephew was. "Fine." He grudgingly said. "If you behave the whole week while Marge is here I will sign your form."Harry narrowed his eyes. "How do I know you actually will sign it?"Vernon smiled nastily. "You don't. But it is the best chance you have isn't it?"That was true. Harry gave a stiff nod. "All right. But she better behave too.""Listen here you freak. Marge may say and do whatever she wants. Just smile and nod no matter what she says and stay out of the way all right?" Vernon glared at him. The doorbell rang and he gave Harry another glare and then went to answer it.Harry heard Vernon greeting his sister and closed his eyes. He really hated that woman but it would be worth being civil to her in order to go to Hogsmeade."Where's my Dudders? Where's my precious nephew?" Aunt Marge, just as large as her brother, lumbered in the living room. She gave Harry a dirty look. "My bags aren't going to move themselves boy." She gestured towards the porch and then continued calling Dudley.Harry obediently went and grabbed her bags, dodging Marge's bulldog Ripper whose favorite hobby was biting Harry. He brought the bags in and took them upstairs to the room Marge stayed in when she visited. He went back downstairs and watched Marge fuss over Dudley."Look at my Dudley! Such a handsome boy!" Marge cried. Petunia and Vernon smiled proudly at their son, who was so large he didn't walk so much as waddle."Hi Aunt Marge. You look as lovely as always." Dudley gave his Aunt a fake smile as he knew she would shower him with gifts.Petunia looked close to tears. "Isn't he the sweetest thing?"Harry wanted to gag but kept a neutral expression on his face. He was hoping to get to grab some food and then escape to his bedroom.Marge handed Dudley a gift bag full of presents and also handed him some money. "For the best nephew in the world." She said fondly. She caught sight of Harry. "Hope you aren't expecting any gifts from me boy."Harry wanted to tell her he didn't want anything from her ever but simply stayed silent. He ignored Dudley laughing at him.Petunia clapped her hands together. "We have reservations we don't want to be late for. Marge you will love this restaurant. It is very refined.""Sounds wonderful Petunia. I will be paying for dinner of course." She glanced over at Harry. "Feed Ripper so that the rest of us can leave." She put a bag down on the coffee table. "If you like, you may share his food." She said with a mean smile. The Dursley's all laughed.Harry walked into the kitchen to get a bowl for the dog, going over different Quidditch moves in his mind to drown out his relatives. After he fed the dog he saw his Uncle waiting for him. "Hurry up, I'm hungry." He muttered as he huffed his way upstairs to lock Harry in his room. The Dursley's never let him be alone in the house without locking him up. They said they didn't trust him not to ruin their nice things. "Can I have some food?" He asked as he stepped into his room."Greedy aren't you?" Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut and bolted all the locks.Harry looked at Hedwig who was in her cage and shrugged. He did have some food hidden in his room. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a cake for his birthday. He lifted the floorboard and took it out, breaking off a piece for Hedwig. She gobbled it up and he petted her gently. "I'm going to send you to the Burrow for the rest of summer Hedwig." He said softly. She looked at him reproachfully and hooted. Harry shook his head. "It will be safer for you there. They'll feed you and you won't have to stay in your cage all day. I'll be fine." He assured her.Thankfully the bars were off of his window. Uncle Vernon had said there was no use to pay for the bars when some flying car would just come and tear them off. He wrote a note for Ron and tied it to Hedwig's leg. He sent her off and watched her fly off into the night sky. He wished he could fly with her.HPHPHPHPHPHarry did fairly well of staying out of Marge's way the next few days. He made the food and did his usual chores which was pretty much everything and endured the cruel jokes made at his expense. He said nothing when Ripper bit his leg so hard it bled and kept quiet when Dudley punched him in his still sore side.It all paid off when Harry was cooking the last meal for Marge Dursley. She was leaving early the next morning and then Harry could finally get his permission slip signed."I really have to admire you Petunia." Marge said as the Dursley's ate their dinner while Harry cleaned up the kitchen from making everyone dinner. He managed to scarf down some bread while they ate in case he didn't get any leftovers."Taking in your pathetic sister's child the way you did." Marge shook her head, her multiple chins wobbling. "I would have drowned the little brat if it were me.""Yes, well." Petunia threw a look to Harry and then Vernon. "It was the right thing to do.""It's just who we are." Vernon added.Marge poured herself another glass of brandy. "You two are such good people. Especially knowing the boy's history with having parents like his."Harry looked up from his cleaning and narrowed his eyes at Marge. He could take insults against himself but not at his parents."Would you like more casserole Marge?" Vernon asked hastily. He didn't want to risk one of the boy's episodes."Just a bit Vernon." Marge answered with a chuckle. "I have to keep watch of what I eat."Harry couldn't help snorting at that as he returned to washing the pans.Marge threw him a glance. "Did you say something boy?""No Aunt Marge." Harry responded."I don't like your tone boy. Do they not beat you hard enough at that school you go to? What school is it again Vernon?" Marge poured herself yet another glass of brandy."St. Brutus's Secure Centre for hopeless cases Marge." Vernon said with a glare in Harry's direction as if warning the boy not to contradict him."Make sure to let that school know you don't mind if brute force is used to control the whelp." Marge nodded. "It's all you can do for a boy like that. He will probably end up like his parents anyway. An out of work drunk.""My parents were not out of work drunks!" Harry said loudly. They died protecting him; he would not let her talk about them like that.Marge grinned, her face red from all the alcohol she had been drinking. "Proud of you loser parents are you boy? The world is a better place without people like that! Especially your mother from what Petunia has told me. Was she even sure her husband was the boy's father Petunia?" Marge chuckled. "They got themselves killed and should have had you with them when they did I say!""Shut up!" Harry yelled as his temper fully loose now. How dare she? How dare she imply that about his mother!"Don't you talk to me like that you-"She broke off as she noticed her hand getting bigger. And bigger. She looked down and noticed her body was doing the same thing."Marge?" Petunia watched in shock as her sister-in-law began inflating.Vernon turned to Harry. "Set her to rights! Now!"Harry was shaking, he was so angry. He didn't even know how he had done that to Marge, but he didn't care. She had been way out of line!Ripper began barking as Marge began to float out of her chair like a hot air balloon and Dudley took a break from stuffing his face to watch in horror as his Aunt floated out through the sliding doors."Marge come back!" Vernon ran after his sister and tried to grab her hand as she floated up into the sky. When he began to rise up with her he let go and could only watch as she shrieked as she rose higher and higher.Vernon raced back into the kitchen. "Fix her boy or I'll kill you!"Harry had no idea how to fix her even if he wanted to. All he knew was that he had had enough. He ran to his room and quickly packed. His trunk was in his cupboard so he went downstairs and got it out. He had known how to pick the cheap lock on the cupboard for awhile now. He headed towards the front door."Fix her!" Vernon stomped up to him and without warning backhanded him.Harry steadied himself and took out his wand and pointed it straight between his Uncle's eyes. "Don't test me anymore. I have nothing to lose now." He said calmly.Vernon's eyes widened and he took a step back. "Fine. Get out.""Happily." Harry lugged his trunk, duffel bag and Hedwig's cage outside and didn't stop moving until he got to the corner. He looked up and could see Marge still rolling through the evening sky.Harry didn't know what to do. He didn't have Hedwig so he couldn't send a letter asking for help. He had no friends here. He supposed he could go to Mrs. Figgs house. She seemed to like him well enough and then he could figure out what to do. Before he could start walking he heard a loud bark. He looked across the street and saw a huge black dog staring at him. He really didn't want another dog bite so he waved his wand around hoping to scare it. "Go away!"A loud noise caught his attention as a triple-decker purple bus suddenly popped onto the street. Harry stumbled back from shock and fell over his trunk.A guy looking to be in his early twenties stepped out of the bus. "Good evening! Welcome to the Knight Bus, the best transport for the stranded witch or wizard. The name is Stan Shunpike and I am your conductor this evening. We can take you anywhere you want to go except nothing underwater!" He looked down at Harry in confusion. "What are you doing down there?""I fell." Harry said as he got back up.Stan looked at him curiously. "What did you fall down for?""It's not like I did it on purpose!" Harry said as he brushed himself off. He looked across the street and saw that the dog was gone."What's your name again?" Stan asked as he looked at him curiously."Uh, Neville." Harry blurted out as he brushed his fringe down over his scar. He hated how people reacted when they found out who he was. It was ridicules to be famous for something he couldn't even remember."Well Neville, where would you like a ride to? You did summon us." Stan said.Harry was surprised. "I did? How did I do that?"Stan looked exasperated. "You flung your wand out of course! Now do you want a ride or not?""Yes, I do." Harry thought quickly. "Um, the Leaky Cauldron." He had some money on him and could probably afford a room for a night or two until he could get a hold of the Weasley's. He wondered if he could live with them as he was sure to be expelled.Harry boarded the bus and was shocked to see cots in it. There were a few people sleeping and luggage was simply strewn all over. Harry took a seat on a cot up front and set his luggage beside him. He ended up hugging his luggage as the bus drove very fast and jerky. Thinking he might be sick he shut his eyes."Here we are!" Stan announced a few minutes later.Harry opened his eyes and hurried off the bus. He was about to thank Stan when a familiar looking man came up to him. He remembered him as the minister of magic who had arrested Hagrid despite Hagrid being innocent."There you are!" The man said in relief. "Well, Mr. Potter you gave us quite a fright!""I thought you said your name was Neville." Stan protested. He looked at the driver. "Hear that Ernie? We gave a ride to the Harry Potter!""Yes yes. Mr. Potter I am Cornelius Fudge Minister of Magic. I just want to assure you that your Aunt has been put back right and her memory modified. No harm done." Fudge said jovially. "You are free to return home now."Harry's mouth dropped open. "What? I'm not going back!"Fudge frowned. "If you are worried about your relative's being mad I have already been in touch with Albus Dumbledore and he sent me a note for you to give to them." He handed Harry the letter. "What happened to your face?"Harry was about to say the usual, that he fell, but decided to be truthful. He didn't want to think about what would happen to him if he went back. Since he obviously wasn't being expelled he couldn't' risk doing magic again therefore he couldn't defend himself. "My uncle is what happened."Fudge looked surprised but then his face relaxed. "Well, nothing wrong with having strict guardians is there? Your Uncle was understandably upset, I'm sure. You are safe at your home Mr. Potter and I am sure your relative's just want to make sure you make better decisions. There is an escaped murderer on the loose after all."That distracted Harry from protesting to the rubbish Fudge had been spewing about his relatives. "The only escaped murderer I've heard of was on the muggle news. Sirius Black, I think."Fudge looked uncomfortable. "He's actually a wizard though muggles should be aware of him too. Very dangerous. You best get back home now."Harry shook his head. "You don't understand how it is there-""Now Mr. Potter you should feel very lucky that you are not being punished for using magic. Try not to do that again, you've put your guardians through a lot tonight. My suggestion is to apologize, give them the Headmaster's letter and accept whatever punishment they may give you." He looked at the conductor who had been watching in fascination. "Stan, take him back to where you found him."Before Harry could try and protest again Stan had grabbed his luggage and put it back in the bus. Harry looked at Fudge who was looking at his watch impatiently and decided it wasn't worth trying to argue. He had told the truth about how he was treated at the Dursley's and just like the one time he had told someone as a child, no one cared. The same had happened when he had tried to hint to Dumbledore exactly why he wished to stay at Hogwarts during the summer. Harry had then been told about the blood wards and how important they supposedly were. Feeling incredibly nervous at what would await him at the Dursley's; he thanked the minister and got back on the bus. He was going back and could only hope he would survive it.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Please review if you get a chance! I would love to hear from you! =)Harry had been locked in his room for almost a week. The only thing his Aunt put through the cat flap was a couple bottles of water. He was allowed out to use the loo in the morning and evening. Harry carefully pushed himself into a sitting position on his bed. His face hurt from being slapped by Aunt Petunia and he had bruises on his arms and back from his Uncle hitting him. Vernon had also punched him in the side where he was already hurt. Needless to say, they were not pleased to see him return. His relative's had been adamant that he was not allowed back in the house when he had shown up on their porch. Aunt Petunia changed her mind after reading the letter from Dumbledore and had reluctantly told Uncle Vernon that they had to take him back. Harry had then received his "punishment" and was still recovering from it. He didn't know how bad he was hurt but at least he could now move around without wanting to scream in agony.Of course, getting his Hogsmeade permission slip signed was out. He wondered if Professor McGonagall could sign it for him.There was tapping at his window and Harry saw it was Hedwig. He slowly made his way to open it and she flew in and circled him, hooting."Shh." Harry whispered, not wanting his relative's to hear her.Hedwig gazed at him and Harry was sure he could see concern in her eyes. "I'm okay." Harry said softly as he sat back down on the bed. Hedwig settled herself on his shoulder and very softly hooted in his ear as if singing a lullaby. Tears burned in Harry's eyes as he reached up and stroked her soft feathers. Harry didn't know how she knew he needed a friend but guessed it was because she was his familiar. She stayed with him until he fell asleep before she flew back out the window that was still open.HPHPHPHPA few days before school was to begin Harry received a note from Dumbledore that he was arranging Arthur Weasley to pick him up to take him to get his books as well as let him stay at the Burrow. Harry was beyond relieved. His Aunt and Uncle had started letting him out of his room to do chores but his Uncle and Dudley knocked him around whenever the mood struck them which was even more than usual. Harry had been feeling light headed and weak. He figured it was because he was hungry and he couldn't wait to leave. The only thing that concerned him was his appearance. He had lost a good deal of weight and was pale with dark shadows under his eyes, plus the bruises. He worried about what Mr. Weasley would say when he saw him and how he would explain it. After worrying about it suddenly one morning the problem solved itself. His appearance changed and there were no signs of how horrible his summer had been. Accidental magic again, Harry thought absently as he gazed at his now healthy looking reflection.Finally the day had arrived and Harry was bringing his things downstairs. He stood by his cupboard."Wait outside for your freaky friend." Vernon said as he opened the cupboard and let Harry take his trunk. "I don't want more of your kind in my home!""Fine with me." Harry replied taking his things and lugging them out to the porch. He didn't want Arthur Weasley subjected to his Uncle anyway."Tell that Headmaster of yours that we don't want any letters informing us you have been hurt or anything." Aunt Petunia added with a glare. "We don't care. The only letter I would welcome is if it is informing us that you died or something." She and Vernon laughed.Harry rolled his eyes and waited outside breathing a sigh of relief when they slammed the door shut. He didn't have to see them again until next summer."Harry!" Arthur Weasley greeted him as he walked up to his house. "Have you been waiting long? You didn't have to wait outside.""Oh, um, I was just excited." Harry said, watching as Mr. Weasley shrunk his trunk, duffel bag and Hedwig's cage. "Thanks for coming to get me Mr. Weasley.""It's no problem Harry. Ron can't wait to see you. Actually the whole Weasley clan can't wait to see you." Mr. Weasley said as they walked down and found a spot where no one would see them. "You probably haven't apparated before have you? Grab a hold of my arm. It may be a little uncomfortable." He warned Harry.Harry did as he said and closed his eyes as he felt a like he was being squeezed. He swayed after Mr. Weasley said they had arrived at the Burrow. Mr. Weasley helped to steady him. "Are you okay?""Yeah. That was…interesting." Harry said as he took a deep breath. He felt like he was going to be sick. Once the feeling passed he smiled at the sight of the Burrow. It was truly a magical house and he thought it was brilliant."Hey Harry!" Ron greeted when he walked inside."Hey Ron!" Harry grinned at his best friend.Ron helped him carry his things upstairs and into Ron's room. There was a cot set up for Harry and he happily plopped himself on it."So mate, what happened this summer?" Ron asked in a hushed voice. "Dad said he heard you showed up at the Leaky Cauldron and Fudge had to send you back home."Harry thought quickly. Some of the truth he could tell. "I blew up my Aunt Marge." He admitted. He laughed at the shocked look on Ron's face."You did what? You blew her up!" Ron gaped at him."I didn't mean to. I don't even know how I did it." Harry said with a shrug. "I got angry and the next thing I know she was inflating like a balloon." He looked at Ron and they both started laughing."Oh man." Ron said chuckling, shaking his head. "If I ever did that to my Aunt Muriel, Mum would kill me! And you didn't get into trouble?"Harry stiffened slightly. "What do you mean?""You know, with the ministry." Ron was fiddling in his desk drawer and didn't see Harry's tense expression.Harry relaxed. "No, at least Fudge didn't say anything. He just sent me back to the Dursley's." Which had been punishment enough."You get away with everything mate." Ron offered Harry a chocolate frog."Yup, lucky me." Harry said, keeping his tone casual. They talked Quidditch until it was time to go to Diagon Alley to get their school supplies.Harry was happy when they ran into Hermione and the three friends caught up as they bought their books."Blimey Hermione, how many classes are you taking?" Ron asked as he watched her carry a pile of books to the counter."I don't know what you're talking about Ron." Hermione said huffily as she paid for her books."What two electives did you add?" Harry asked curiously."All of them." Hermione answered.Ron stared at her like she had grown two heads. "Are you mental? Why all of them? I mean, what can you learn from muggle studies? You're a muggle-born!""But it will be so interesting to learn it from a Wizarding point of view!" Hermione said excitedly.Ron rolled his eyes and Harry was about to laugh when a wave of dizziness hit him and he staggered a bit."Harry? Are you okay?' Hermione asked in concern. She took a step towards him and studied his face.Harry shook his head to clear it. "I'm fine. I think I'm still dizzy from apparating earlier. I can't figure out which is worse, that or the floo." He joked."Hmm." Hermione said, exchanging a look with Ron.Harry sighed. "What?""They didn't feed you again did they?" Ron asked in a quiet voice. It was obvious that he was talking about the Dursley's.Harry shrugged. "They fed me a little. I'll make up for it at your house and Hogwarts." He grinned."Well, at least you don't look like you've lost much weight." Hormone said as she looked him over."I'm fine. Really." Harry assured them, grateful that his accidental magic had created the glamour. He didn't want to even think of what their reactions would be if they saw what he really looked like. He knew he couldn't tell them about the way the Dursley's really treated him as then they would just worry and it wasn't like anyone could do anything about it anyway. It was humiliating enough that they knew the Dursley's didn't like to feed him and hated him.HPHPHPHPDinner was delicious though Harry could only manage a little bit as his stomach started to hurt. He stayed downstairs after Ron, Ginny and the twins went upstairs for the night and cleaned up from where they had been playing exploding snap. After he was done, Harry started to go upstairs but part of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's conversation stopped him."Harry has a right to know." Mr. Weasley insisted to his wife.Mrs. Weasley shook her head. "He doesn't need to know all the details. What would be the point? Besides, it is not our place." Mrs. Weasley said regretfully. "I'm sure Albus will tell him if he thinks he should know.""I still think it would be better if Harry was fully warned. He needs to know so he can be more careful." Mr. Weasley sighed. "He's a good kid. I just want him safe.""So do I. I feel like he is part of the family as it is." Mrs. Weasley smiled.Harry gave a smile at that though he was curious as to what Mr. Weasley wanted to warn him about. What was going on? The only think he had heard about recently was the Sirius Black prisoner who escaped. But it couldn't be about that, what would that have to do with Harry? He felt frustrated that something was going on, something that Mr. Weasley thought he should know about and he was being kept in the dark. He tried to stuff down his anger about it, stuff it down with the anger he felt at being treated the way he was by his relative's. He just wondered how much longer he could keep a lid on his emotions.HPHPHPHPFinally it was September 1st and it was time to board the Hogwarts Express. Parents and students were on the platform saying goodbye to each other."Behave yourselves! Study hard but have fun too! Ron, Fred and George I don't want to have to send any howlers this year!" Mrs. Weasley was calling as they started to board the train.Harry was about to follow when Mr. Weasley pulled him aside. "Harry, I just want to warn you to be extra careful this year."Harry looked at Mr. Weasley's worried face. "Is this because of the prisoner that escaped? Sirius Black?"Mr. Weasley nodded seriously. "He's dangerous Harry. And he was a supporter of You-Know-Who. There is a chance he could want to come after you. No one wanted to worry you about it but as you kids tend to get into mischief," He smiled knowingly. "I just think you should know so you will be extra aware."Harry nodded. "Thank you for telling me the truth. I'll be careful." He promised. As he boarded the train he thought about what Mr. Weasley had said. Did Sirius Black really escape from Azkaban to come after him? That was…disturbing. Harry really wanted a stress free year. That wasn't too much to ask for was it?Harry boarded the train and began making his way down the aisle to join his friends when he was pushed from behind. He stumbled and his quick reflexes kept him from falling on his face. "Hey!"Jeremy Stretton, a fifth year Ravenclaw who a chaser on the Quidditch team, sneered at him. "Oh, so sorry boy hero.""We wouldn't want to damage the celebrity." Grant Page, a fellow Ravenclaw who also played on the Quidditch team as keeper, added in mock concern.Harry gritted his teeth. He was really not in the mood to be bullied yet again. He had had enough of that this past summer. He knew these two didn't like him; they glared at him and made snide comments each time Gryffindor won against them. "Sod off." He snapped and pushed ahead to the compartment Ron and Hermione were waiting in."What took you so long?" Ron asked in a loud whisper. He nodded towards the man seated across from him who was leaning against the window and sleeping.Harry looked at the man curiously and sat next to him. "Stretton and Page thought they would have some fun." He shrugged, wincing. The pain in his side was getting worse and several bruises that he still had were aching. Too bad the glamour didn't mask the actual pain too."Those two are such bullies." Hermione said as she petted her new familiar, an orange cat named Crookshanks."They should be in Slytherin with the way they act." Ron huffed.Harry glanced over at the sleeping stranger and asked quietly, "Do you know who he is?""No idea." Ron shrugged."Professor R. Lupin." Hermione answered.Ron's mouth fell open. "How do you know that? How do you know everything? Blimey!"Hermione rolled her eyes. "It's written on his suitcase Ronald, honestly.""Oh." Ron looked embarrassed.Harry grinned and then leaned forward. "Your Dad pulled me aside before I boarded the train." He told them quietly, not wanting to risk being overheard by the new Professor. "To warn me.""Warn you about what?" Hermione asked in concern as she and Ron also leaned forward."You heard about the escaped prisoner right?" Harry asked."Sirius Black." Ron nodded."They don't know how he could have escaped. Azkaban is supposed to be escape proof. He killed thirteen people." Hermione said with a slight shiver.Harry cleared his throat. "Well, apparently he was in league with Voldemort." He ignored the wince Ron gave at the name. "And it's possible he may be after me."Hermione eyes widened. "What? Oh Harry, that's horrible! What steps are being done to protect you?""I don't know. I'm not even supposed to know about it." Harry answered. "I think it is just a possibility that he might be after me." He tried to sound unconcerned."Wow mate. I take back what I said the other day. You have some bad luck." Ron whistled slowly.Harry snorted. "I doubt it's anything to really worry about. Besides, Hogwarts is safe enough." Even though I've almost died there the last two years, he thought with a grimace."Harry, you have to be really careful this year." Hermione said with wide eyes. "Follow all the rules and we'll have to keep an extra eye out during the Hogsmeade trips.""I can't go to Hogsmeade. My relative's didn't sign my permission slip." Harry said with a sigh."You have to go! Just get McGonagall to sign it!" Ron looked horrified at the thought of not being able to go to Hogsmeade."Professor McGonagall is not his guardian Ron." Hermione pointed out. She looked at Harry sympathetically. "It couldn't hurt to ask though. But maybe it is better that you don't go if a murderer is after you.""He may not even be after me." Harry said in frustration. He closed his, as his head felt like it was spinning. I must be coming down with something, he thought.Suddenly they noticed the train was slowing down and then stopped completely."Are we there already? That was fast." Ron remarked as he pushed the small cage holding his pet rat further away from Crookshanks who was staring at it hungrily."We can't be there already." Hermione said as she looked out the window. "There is something out there."Ron and Harry peered out the window as well and watched in surprise as frost settled in on the windows. It began to get dark and cold, a chill making all of them shiver."What's going on?" Ron asked nervously.The compartment door opened and a shadowy figure began to float in and soon all Harry could feel was cold and despair. He saw a flash of green light and heard a woman screaming."Expecto Patronam!"The last thing Harry saw before passing out was what looked like a large silvery white balloon.HPHPHPHPWhen Harry came to he was surrounded by Ron, Hermione and the new Professor."Harry, are you alright?" Hermione asked anxiously.Harry nodded slowly, though he felt chilled and weak. "What happened? Who screamed?"Ron looked confused. "Nobody screamed.""Here, this will help." Professor Lupin handed each of them a piece of chocolate."What was that thing?" Ron asked as he took a bite."A Dementor. Excuse me; I need to go talk to the driver." Professor Lupin strolled out of the compartment."What is a Dementor?" Harry asked as he bit into the chocolate. He immediately felt warmth spread through him."They are the guards at Azkaban. It was here looking for Sirius Black!" Ron said excitedly, feeling better since eating the chocolate.Hermione nodded. "The Professor told it that none of us were hiding Sirius Black here and to go away. When it didn't he said a spell and something silvery shot out and it backed away.""But you didn't hear anyone scream?" Harry pressed. He was sure he had heard it. "And did anyone else, er, pass out?"Ron looked uncomfortable. "Well, no. I think it was just you. But it was awful, I felt like I would never be cheerful again!"Hermione frowned. "We didn't hear anyone scream. It's odd that you did though.""Hey Potter! There is a rumor going around that you fainted! Someone heard the driver talking to someone about it. Please tell me it's true." Draco Malfoy was standing in their doorway, looking gleeful."Go away Malfoy!" Ron said angrily."It's true then." Draco exchanged a grin with fellow Slytherin Theodore Nott. "We better be off and make sure that everyone knows!" Draco and Theo left, laughing their heads off.Harry slumped back in his seat. They hadn't even arrived at Hogwarts and already the year was off to a bad start.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.When Harry and his friends walked up to the castle, Harry was quite aware of whispering and snickers being sent in his direction. Harry clenched his hands into fists as he tried to control his temper. He wanted to shout at the top of his lungs for everyone to just shut up. He forced himself to concentrate on Ron's and Hermione's argument over their familiars. Ron was convinced that her cat was after his rat. The distraction worked and Harry was able to relax and be amused at his friend's disagreement."Potter and Granger, if you could step this way for a moment!" Professor McGonagall called before the trio started up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower.Harry sighed. This better not be about what happened on the train. He felt weary and dizzy and had hoped to lay down for a bit before the sorting feast was under way. Since the first years took the boats with Hagrid, they always had a little time before the feast started."I'll meet you guys in the common room. Or the Great Hall if you take too long." Ron said as he sprinted up the steps."Yes Professor?" Hermione asked after she and Harry had made their way to their Head of House."I would like to speak with you Miss. Granger about your schedule. First though, Mr. Potter how are you feeling?" Professor McGonagall asked as she looked at him critically. "I think a trip to the infirmary is in order."Harry's eyes widened. He couldn't risk Pomfrey finding out about his glamour. "No Ma'am that won't be necessary. I'm fine."Professor McGonagall looked unconvinced. "It wouldn't hurt for you to see Madam Pomfrey just to be sure.""No!" Harry closed his eyes for a second and then opened them again, noting McGonagall's look of concern and disapproval. "Please Professor McGonagall, I really am fine. Professor Lupin gave us all chocolate and that helped loads.""I see." Professor McGonagall nodded. "Very well. Go on ahead while I talk to Miss. Granger then."Harry was beyond relieved. "Thank you Ma'am." He turned and walked to the stairs but before he could take the first step he heard loud sniggering from behind him."Well, well we aren't even back for a day and Potter is already demanding special attention." Jeremy shook his head."Be honest, you pretended to faint just to get more notice right?" Grant sneered at Harry. "You couldn't possibly be that weak that it was real.""I don't know Grant." Jeremy said thoughtfully. "Potter is pretty pathetic. He really could be that weak." They both burst into laughter."It's nice that at least the two of you think you're funny." Harry rolled his eyes and turned to leave when Jeremy grabbed his arm and pulled him back. Harry bit his lip as his already bruised arm was aggravated."We didn't say you could go Potter!" Jeremy said, pulling himself up to fool height. "Ask permission and then we'll let you go. Do it boy!"It was the term boy that was the final straw for Harry. He was in pain, had been in pain for while. He was hungry, tired, and just plain fed up. He pushed Jeremy as hard as he could and when Grant came at him, Harry shot out his foot and kicked the Ravenclaw in the shin. Without thinking he pulled his wand and pointed it straight at the two teenagers. "Furnunc-"His spell was stopped by a shout from McGonagall."Mr. Potter, lower your wand immediately!" Professor McGonagall hurried over with Hermione right behind her. "What do you think you are doing?""Potter's insane!" Grant snarled as he rubbed his shin."They wouldn't leave me alone! They're bullies!" Harry protested."Then you get an adult Mr. Potter, you do not attack and try to hex a fellow student!" Professor McGonagall said sternly.Harry stared at her. It was always the same. The bullies got away with everything. "Take points then. I really don't care." Harry turned, ignoring Hermione's gasp and headed upstairs. His head was pounding and his side felt weird to the touch, even though it looked normal. He ignored everyone and went into his dorm and sat on his bed. He felt tired and guilty. He couldn't believe he had talked to McGonagall like that, it had just slipped out."What happened mate?" Ron asked as he came into the dorm. He sat down on the bed across from Harry. "Did McGonagall have bad news or something?"Harry shook his head and was about to answer when Hermione burst in, her face set in disapproval. "Harry Potter what were you thinking? I can't believe you talked to Professor McGonagall like that!"Ron looked at Harry in surprise. "What?""Stretton and Page started it but of course no one cares about that." Harry muttered."Professor McGonagall saw Jeremy grab you and was already coming over but then you attacked them!" Hermione huffed."You did? Awesome, what did you do?" Ron asked eagerly."I pushed Stretton down and kicked Page in the shin and was about to hex them when McGonagall stopped me." Harry said with a flush. He really couldn't believe he had done that. It wasn't like him. He put his hand to his side and grimaced slightly."He also spoke very rudely to Professor McGonagall." Hermione told Ron, neither of them saw the look of pain on Harry's face. "He told her to go ahead and take points and then walked away! Professor McGonagall was shocked and then she headed towards the Headmaster's office! Harry, for trying to hex a student you could be suspended or even expelled!""He didn't finish the hex." Ron pointed out easily. "Besides, students hex each other all the time. Remember when Malfoy cast the Leg-Locker curse on Neville? Nothing happened to him.""That doesn't make it right Ronald! Besides, we don't know if Malfoy got away with it. Professor Snape may have heard about it and punished Malfoy." Hermione said, thought she didn't look too convinced.Harry and Ron exchanged a look and then burst into laughter. "Professor Snape never punishes the Slytherins! He lets them do whatever they want!" Ron shook his head.Hermione sighed and then gave a mild glare to Harry. "You should apologize to Professor McGonagall Harry. And I really hope you don't get into too much trouble.""I will." Harry said as he stood up. He wavered a bit. "The feast should be starting soon.""Let's go! I'm starving!" Ron said enthusiastically as they headed downstairs."How can you be starving when you ate half the food on the trolley on the train?" Hermione asked exasperatedly as they followed the rest of the Gryffindor's who were heading to dinner.Ron shrugged. "I'm a growing boy."Harry snickered as they entered the Great Hall. As he took his seat he looked to the head table and saw Dumbledore and McGonagall in conversation. He noticed that Snape appeared to be listening to them and as if he knew he was being watched, he cast a dark look towards Harry.Harry flinched at the fury he saw on Snape's face and turned away. He tried to eat but found he was feeling sick to his stomach. He drank some water, forgoing the pumpkin juice he usually favored. He felt so hot and the water was nice and cool."Are you too nervous to eat?" Hermione asked somewhat sympathetically. She glanced at the Head Table. "Professor McGonagall doesn't look too mad.""Hey Harry, is it true you beat up five students?" Dean Thomas asked eagerly."I heard one of them was Malfoy." Seamus Finnigan added."No it is not true." Harry sighed. "I did try to hex two Ravenclaws." He admitted."Fifth year Ravenclaws." Ron said proudly. He ignored Hermione's frown."Wow, that's great!" Dean immediately began sharing the news with the students sitting on the other side of him.Harry shrugged and fiddled with his glass of water. He hoped he didn't get suspended or expelled; he couldn't go back to the Dursley's. He just couldn't. Suddenly a piece of paper floated above him and landed next to his glass. He read it and his heart sank."What is it?" Ron asked around a mouthful of pot roast."It says Dumbledore will be sending for me sometime after the feast and to be ready." Harry said nervously. He could only hope the note wasn't implying he needed to be ready to leave Hogwarts.HPHPHPHP"The boy's impulse problem is completely out of hand! Running away from home, pulling his wand on students, someone needs to keep him under control!" Snape fumed as he paced the headmaster's office."So you feel Harry needs more structure and someone to hold him accountable for any misbehavior?" Dumbledore said thoughtfully, stroking his beard."Yes!" Snape snapped. "How am I supposed to keep my promise and protect the boy if his bad behavior is allowed to continue?""And you believe Minerva does not do that?"Snape snorted. "No offense to Minerva but no. She is known to let her favorite students get away with practically murder." He said darkly.Dumbledore gave him a sad smile with a hint of regret in it. "Well then my boy, the solution is clear.""And that would be?" Snape asked impatiently."For the first term of school we will sort Harry into Slytherin." Dumbledore answered, his blue eyes twinkling.In an uncharacstic move Snape's mouth dropped open. "Have you gone mad Headmaster? Potter in Slytherin? That's insane!"Dumbledore shrugged as he chose a lemon drop from the small tin on his desk. "You want to have someone keep a better eye on him and hold him accountable. Who better than yourself? After all, Harry was almost put in Slytherin to begin with.""I do not-wait, what? That's impossible!" Snape scoffed. The golden boy being sorted into Slytherin?"It's true. He talked the hat out of it." Dumbledore said with a smile. "Now, as he would be one of your Slytherins I would expect you to treat him as the rest of the students in your house. This is not an excuse for you to treat him as you usually do." Dumbledore said pointedly.Snape sniffed and looked away. He knew he was unfair and unkind to the boy but he couldn't help it, the boy was so much like his father. Arrogant, spoiled and a rule breaker. Just like Potter senior. Except for the eyes…"I do not appreciate that having Potter in Slytherin is treated as a form of punishment." Snape said stiffly."No my boy, that is not my intention. It is not a punishment; it is more like an experiment." Dumbledore said. "You feel Harry needs more guidance so I am giving you the opportunity to do so. Especially as this year he already has a threat against him.""As it was two Ravenclaw's that Potter attacked perhaps he should be in that House." Snape suggested hopefully."Ah, but it is not Professor Flitwick who is arguing that the child needs more guidance." Dumbledore pointed out."I doubt Potter would be very happy to be in my house. He would have no friends." Snape pointed out."Perhaps he would make some." Dumbledore suggested.Snape gritted his teeth. "Unlikely. And it's enough that I have to put up with that brat in my classes, I should not have to deal with him in my house as well."Dumbledore leaned back in his chair. "Very well. We'll consider the matter dropped. However, I expect to hear no more complaints about Harry as I have given you a chance to help curb his impulsiveness."Snape glared at the Headmaster. One of his few joys was complaining about Potter and now that was being taken away from him! "Perhaps there is some merit to your suggestion." He finally relented. With Black on the loose, Potter did need someone keeping a strict eye on him. "The boy needs to learn to think first before reacting. He also needs someone to make sure he does his schoolwork properly as he is a mediocre student at best."Dumbledore gave him a knowing smile. "I should call for Minerva and tell her the situation. She may not be very pleased at first. Of course, she does count on Harry to win the Quidditch games." He quickly cast a patronus to send a message to the Deputy Headmistress.Snape gave a smirk. "Yes, no Quidditch for the boy wonder. How will he ever cope?""Why couldn't he play Quidditch? He could be on the Slytherin team." Dumbledore suggested."We already have a seeker. Mr. Malfoy." Snape said though his mind was thinking if the Potter brat did play on his team, they could finally return to their winning streak. Hmm…."You sent for me Albus?" Minerva stepped into the room and looked questionably between Snape and Dumbledore.Snape listened with glee as Dumbledore told her of his little idea. The look on her face was priceless."Absolutely not Albus! Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and in Gryffindor he stays." Minerva said firmly. She nodded at Snape. "No offense Severus but I know how you feel about the boy. You and your students would just use this as an opportunity to be even crueler to the child."Snape glared at her. "It is nice to see how little you think of me. In Slytherin we look out for own and Potter would be included in that if he were to be in my house.""Sure he would." Minerva muttered, ignoring the furious look on Snape's face. "Harry stays in my house. There is no reason for him to be in Slytherin. It is not a suitable punishment for the fight this evening. A detention will be enough.""Being in Slytherin is not a punishment!" Snape snapped at her. "There is nothing wrong with my house.""I told you it was not a punishment Severus." Dumbledore said quietly. "Minerva, it is more of a learning exercise. I believe Harry could benefit from the experience.""As well as be watched more carefully." Snape added with a sneer.Minerva stiffened. "Are you implying I am not doing my job as Harry's Head of House?"Snape met her gaze. "Why would I imply such a thing?" He said silkily.Minerva narrowed her eyes. "How dare-""Enough." Dumbledore interrupted. "I have made my decision and was merely informing you Minerva, before I told Harry."Minerva took a deep breath. "I see. Well then, I must insist that Harry still be a part of Gryffindor and stay as seeker. That way he will at least have some happiness this term."Snape struggled to control his temper. Yes, he did not like the boy but to keep eluding that he would treat Potter that bad was grating on his nerves. Of course in her mind, all Slytherins were bad. "If he plays Quidditch this term it will be on my team not yours." He said smoothly. He had thought denying Potter Quidditch privileges for the term would be fun but this was better."Harry wouldn't play against his own house." Minerva said smugly."No he wouldn't. As Gryffindor wouldn't be his house." Snape said just as smugly. He smiled widely when she scowled."Stop you two." Dumbledore sighed. "Quidditch was supposed to be a friendly rivalry among the houses you know. But more important, it is time to let Harry know of our plans. I would appreciate it if you two would stay when I tell him. Minerva, I hope for you to lend your support to Harry and Severus I wish for you to assure him that his treatment in your house will be fair."Minerva pursed her lips but nodded in acceptance while Severus crossed his arms across his chest and inclined his head."Thank you." Dumbledore said gratefully, hoping he wasn't making a mistake by doing this. He wrote down a quick note and then called for a house elf to give the message to Harry. And then they waited.HPHPHPHP"You wanted to see me Professor Dumbledore?" Harry asked when he entered the office. He saw that his Head of House and Professor Snape also there and wondered why Snape would be here. He gratefully sank into the seat Dumbledore gestured to. He really wasn't feeling well and really needed to get his hands on some bruising palm."Yes. The running away from home this past summer and causing a fight before the sorting feast has to be addressed Harry. The solution I have come up with is a little out of the box but I think it is worth trying." Dumbledore continued with a kind smile."So I'm not expelled?" Harry asked nervously. There was no way he was returning to the Dursley's."Of course not my boy." Dumbledore assured him. "For the first term of school you will be resorted. Into Slytherin."Harry stared at the headmaster in shock. That was his punishment? Was Dumbledore insane? He would be killed in his sleep! "No.""Harry,-"Dumbledore started.Harry stood up, trying to ignore the wave of dizziness that came over him. "I know I messed up tonight but this isn't a fair punishment. You can't take my friends from me, especially now.""Harry this isn't a punishment and it isn't permanent." Dumbledore said. "It is a learning experience for you and for the Slytherins as well.""No. I'd rather be expelled." Harry said coldly."Mr. Potter that is enough." Professor McGonagall said firmly.Harry shook his head. They couldn't do this. After the summer he had had, he needed to be with his friends, even if they didn't know the whole truth about how bad the Dursley's treated him. "I know I was out of line in how I spoke to you Professor McGonagall and I'm really sorry. Stretton and Page were bullying me and I just reacted. But this isn't fair." He put a hand to his side. "You are putting me with people who hate me and would gladly kill me, including the head of house.""Watch it Potter." Snape growled. "If I actually wanted you dead I would have let you die your first year in that Quidditch match."Harry looked away. That was another thing; he wouldn't be able to play Quidditch. He couldn't play during the summer as it was and he missed it. They were taking away everything he cared about. "Why are you doing this? You are taking me away from my friends, my house, and Quidditch. Yet you say this is not punishment?""You can still play Quidditch Harry, only on the Slytherin team. And it is just until Christmas." Dumbledore insisted. "Right Severus?""I'm sure something can be arranged." Snape nodded."Harry, please. Trust me." Dumbledore implored.Harry shut his eyes for a moment. "I don't have a choice do I? It's this or I return to the Dursley's.""Why did you run away from them Harry? You know why it is important for you to be there during the summer." Dumbledore said seriously. "I understand you were probably afraid after blowing up your Aunt but to run away-""He blew up Petunia?" Snape suddenly asked Dumbledore, looking interested. He knew the boy had run away from home after doing magic but had not been told what magic he did.Harry was surprised that Snape knew his Aunt's name.Dumbledore shook his head. "No, his Uncle's sister."Unless Harry was imagining it, Snape actually looked disappointed."I don't want to talk about it." Harry said quietly. It's not like them knowing the truth would change anything.Dumbledore sighed. "Very well. Tomorrow morning you will join your new house at breakfast and your things will be moved to your new dorm.""Potter, the Slytherin password is Callidus. That is only for you to know. If I find out any Gryffindors know it, you will have detention for the year." Snape glared at him."I won't tell anyone." Harry said as he returned the glare. "May I go now?" He really felt like he was going to be sick."Have a good night my boy." Dumbledore said with a gentle smile."Remember Mr. Potter, even if I am not officially your Head of House you may come to me with any issues you may have." Professor McGonagall said primly. She didn't acknowledge the scowl her colleague was giving her."Thank you. Good night." Harry nodded to all three adults and then left the Headmaster's office.TBC: A/N: Please review! It would be a nice birthday present! =) I hope to have the next chapter up in a week!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you for the Birthday wishes and especially the reviews! They made my day! =)"You have got to be joking!" Ron said horrified. "They can't do that can they?"Harry nodded wearily. "Even McGonagall is going along with it although she didn't look to happy about it."Hermione looked shocked as well. "I don't know if Hogwarts has ever had anyone resorted before. I should look into it.""Yeah, maybe it's against Hogwarts policy and then Dumbledore will have to change his mind." Ron said hopefully.Harry nodded though he doubted it. Dumbledore would know if it was against policy and it obviously wasn't."I really can't believe they are doing this." Hermione said, worry in her eyes. "You with the Slytherins? Doesn't the Headmaster know that you don't get along? It will be them against you and that's not right.""And Snape as your Head of House? He tries to make your life miserable just being your Professor imagine what he will do now?" Ron stared at Harry wide eyed."Gee thanks guys. You've really cheered me up." Harry tried to joke."Oh Harry, I'm sorry! It's just, I'm worried for you. And what are we going to do without you in Gryffindor?" Hermione asked sadly. "We'll miss you."Harry swallowed the lump that was beginning to form in his throat. His friends meant everything to him. He had never had friends until he came to Hogwarts. And Harry knew there was no possible way he would ever make friends in Slytherin. They all hated him and from what he had heard, most were eager for Voldemort to return someday. He knew he would be bullied and hexed while he was in Slytherin and like most adults, Snape would look the other way. Or maybe Snape would join in, you never knew with the snarky Potion's Master."What about Quidditch?" Ron whined. "You're our best player! Maybe this wasn't Dumbledore's idea, maybe it was Snape's! To keep you from winning all the games!"Hermione rolled her eyes. "Do you really think Professor Dumbledore would agree to a plan like that? No, it had to be the Headmaster's idea. I just don't see the point in it. It seems like an excessive punishment.""According to Dumbledore, it is not a punishment." Harry sighed. "It's a learning experience." He added sarcastically.Hermione looked thoughtful. "Maybe it's a way to get different houses to get along? But still, to have it be you Harry…" She trailed off."Those snakes better not hurt you or else." Ron said determinedly.Hermione was wringing her hands together nervously. "Oh, why did you have to attack those two Ravenclaws?"Harry threw his hands up in frustration. "They attacked me first!""They didn't pull their wands out on you and that is what got you in trouble." Hermione pointed out."When do you have to move?" Ron asked."I have to have breakfast with the Slytherins and Dumbledore said my things would be moved to their dorms in the morning." Harry said glumly."Ugh." Ron said just as glumly. "You have to eat with them too?""He'll be a part of their house Ron. Of course Harry will have to sit with them at meals and in class too." Hermione looked just as dejected as the two of them."Geez the three of you are looking so glum-bum! What's wrong?" Fred and George sat next to them."You look like you got detention for life or something." George laughed. He paused. "Wait, did you?""Worse! Harry's been resorted!" Ron exclaimed loudly."Ron!" Harry hissed as the Gryffindors around them looked at them in shock. He hadn't wanted everyone to know yet."You've been resorted? Why? To where?" Dean demanded as he walked over followed by everyone in the common room."Slytherin." Harry braced himself for the chaos that was sure to happen. And it did."You're going to be in Slytherin!""They can't do that!""Is going to Slytherin the new punishment now?""I'd drop out if it were me!""What about Quidditch!"Harry stood up and tried to get everyone to calm down. "It's um, an experiment Dumbledore is trying." He hedged. "And it is only for the first term and then I'll be back in Gryffindor.""The Slytherins will kill you!" Neville Longbottom's eyes grew wide with fear. "Forget that. Snape will kill you!"Murmured agreement went through the room. Oliver Wood stepped up with his arms crossed across his chest. "So you won't be able to play Quidditch for the whole term? How could you let this happen?!""I don't want this!" Harry yelled, startling the whole room. "You think I want to be in a house that completely hates me? And Snape is sure to be a total git about it!" He put his hand up to his head which was pounding once more and he felt like he was going to be sick again. "Gryffindor is my home and I'm being forced to leave it." He turned and started to go up to his dorm, stumbling a bit as another wave of dizziness hit him."Harry?" Hermione asked in concern."I'm fine. I'm going to bed." Harry said, shaking his head a bit and continuing on his way. Hopefully he would wake up and find this was all a dream.HPHPHPHPSeverus sighed as he left the common room after informing his Slytherins that Potter would be in their house for a term. They had been understandably shocked and upset. They, like he, took exception to that fact that Potter being put in Slytherin was being treated as a punishment. And that was how it would be considered by everyone no matter how Dumbledore had tried to spin it. Despite his personal feelings for the boy, he had been adamant to his snakes that while Potter was one of them he would be treated as a true Slytherin. That meant they would follow the Slytherin code which was that Slytherins stick together. They looked out for and protected their own and that would now include Potter. After all, if a house is divided it will destroy itself.He had to admit he felt some sympathy for Potter. Not that he would say so to anyone but when he had been in school he would have not survived being made to live in Gryffindor for a day never mind a term. Well, except that he would have been in the same house as Lily. If only…Snape made a stop at the infirmary before retiring for the night. He kept health records of all his Slytherins as many came from abusive homes. He always had them checked at the start of term. Now that Potter was one of his Slytherins he would need to add his file."Severus." Poppy said in surprise. "I was just about to leave for the night. Is something wrong? Are you sick?""No." Severus said. "I need Potters file for my records. I assume he has already been checked or has an appointment to as it is the start of the year?""No he hasn't. You are the only head of house that does that Severus." Poppy said as she summoned the file on Harry. "All I have are his records from when he has been admitted here from being hurt at school."Severus took the file and glanced through it. They were of his times being hurt at Quidditch, when the brat when after the stone and chamber, when that idiot Lockhart vanished his bones but nothing from before Hogwarts. Severus wasn't that surprised that he was the only Professor that checked. He himself had come from an abusive home and he wanted to help the students who were like him."I would like a full history done tomorrow." Severus said.Poppy nodded. "Tell him to come by after his last class. I'll run a full diagnostic.""Thank you Poppy." Severus inclined his head and went to his quarters to finally rest for the night.HPHPHPHPWhen Harry woke up the next morning he was feeling worse. Probably nerves, he thought as he touched his left side. As he started to get ready he noticed his robes now had a Slytherin crest on it and his scarf that was hanging was now silver and green. He sighed. Not a dream then."Is it time to get up already?" Ron groaned as he buried his head in his pillow."Just think of the abundance of food waiting for you in the Great Hall." Harry said absently as he gathered his books into his bag. Reminding Ron of breakfast was the usual way he hurried along his friend in the mornings."Oh yeah!" Ron sounded more enthusiastic as he got up. "Oh yeah." He said more solemnly as he remembered that this morning Harry would be leaving Gryffindor. "Hey, maybe you can use your cloak and sneak back in here. You know the password so…""I thought of that but you know everyone in Slytherin will be waiting to get me in trouble. I better not risk it or I may have to stay all year in Slytherin." Harry said as he finished putting his shoes on. He stood up and immediately all of his belongings except what he was wearing and his book bag disappeared."Guess it's real." Ron said as he tied his red and gold tie. He wrinkled his nose a bit at Harry's green and silver one.Harry grabbed his bag. "It's time to face the music. What happened after I left the common room last night? Did everyone calm down?""Yeah. Well, eventually. Most are angry on your behalf but some are well, angry that you are giving in and going to Slytherin." Ron stepped back and Harry's angry expression. "Their words not mine! There are just a few older students who think you should have given the Headmaster an ultimatum that you would either go home or stay in Gryffindor.""I can't risk having to go to the Dursley's before I absolutely have to." Harry said flatly. "Believe it or not, I'd rather be in Slytherin."Ron looked at him sympathetically. "Don't really blame you mate. At least you get to eat here no matter what house you are in." He brightened. "Think of it this way, you can lose Slytherin tons of points!"Harry laughed. "Sure, cause that will go over real well with Snape."Ron's face fell. "Oh, right. Don't want to get on his bad side. Well, you don't want to get even more on his bad side than you already are."Harry rolled his eyes. "Thanks."Hermione met them at the bottom of the stairs, pity clear in her eyes. Most of the Gryffindors were looking at him the same way except for a few older students. He noticed Cormac McLaggen and Alexander Williams were glaring hard at him."We're sorry to see you go Harry." Percy Weasley said to him as he adjusted his Head Boy badge. "Don't worry, if you throw yourself into your studies the first term will go by fast."Hermione brightened. "You can spend all of your free time in the library with Ron and me.""All of our free time?" Ron repeated.Hermione threw him a look. "It's the only way to be able to talk with Harry!"Ron nodded slowly. "True."The Gryffindors walked down together and Harry stayed silent as they entered the Great Hall. He looked towards the Slytherin table and saw many of them were glaring at him. He looked up at the Head Table and saw Dumbledore give him an encouraging smile. He darted his eyes over to Snape and saw him give a curt nod and then look pointedly towards the Slytherin table."See you guys later." Harry mumbled as he made his way over to the Slytherin table. His table now. He could hear some Ravenclaws whispering as to why he was wearing a Slytherin crest. He ignored them and slid into the seat at the end of the table and kept his eyes averted. His side was throbbing, his head still hurt and he felt really hot."Good morning."Harry looked up and into the dark blue eyes of the girl sitting across from him. The eyes were framed by her long blonde hair. Harry didn't know who she was but had noticed her last year. "Good morning." He said tentatively. For all he knew she was going to prank him or mock him."Welcome to Slytherin." She added."Thank you?" Harry looked at her questionably.She frowned. "What?"Harry fiddled with his empty glass. He hadn't bothered to put any food on his plate or drink anything. His stomach was still feeling funny. "Two things. First, why are you being nice to me?"The girl huffed. "Maybe I'm a nice person?" She shook her head and then looked at him with her head tilted to the side. "Unless you are one of those people who think that no nice person could ever be in Slytherin. If that's the case, then I shouldn't have bothered.""No, I'm sorry. It's just…well; no one has been nice to me from Slytherin. I thought…" Harry shook his head. He had assumed all Slytherins hated him since he was the boy-who-lived.The pretty blonde relented. "True, you probably don't have many positive experiences with our house." She looked at him curiously. "What was the second thing?""I don't know your name." Harry said with a grin.The girl's eyes widened. "Oh, I'm sorry! How rude of me. My name is Daphne Greengrass. I'm a third year like you." She gestured to the girl sitting next to her. "This is Tracey Davis, also a third year.""It's nice to meet you both." Harry said nodding towards Tracey. Tracey blushed a bit.Breakfast was interrupted by Dumbledore who had stood and was tapping his glass to get their attention. "Good morning students! Welcome to another year of Hogwarts! To those who are starting their first year, we welcome you. A few announcements and then you may return to your meal. The forbidden forest is still off limits and our caretaker Argus Filch would like me to ask you not to track in dirt into the castle. We also have two new Professor's starting this year. I am pleased to announce that Rubeus Hagrid will be taking over Care of Magical Creatures!" Applause broke out over the announcement and Hagrid beamed. "And our new Defense against the Dark Arts Professor will be Remus Lupin, a former student of Hogwarts." Dumbledore continued. "A word of caution, Hogwarts also has Dementor's guarding the castle until escaped prisoner Sirius Black is caught. And lastly for the first term this year, Harry Potter has been resorted into Slytherin."The room erupted into loud chatter and exclamations."He's got to be bloody joking!""What could Potter have done that was so bad he's now considered a Slytherin?""Poor Potter with those evil snakes!""Who wants to place a bet he won't survive the term?""Enough!" Dumbledore said loudly, his eyes not their normally twinkling self. "This is not a punishment and Mr. Potter will be quite safe in Slytherin I assure you."Harry looked at Snape and was impressed with the look of loathing he saw the Potion's Master giving everyone in the Great Hall. If Harry had to guess he would guess Snape was mentally collecting names of those who spoke badly of Slytherin so he could hand out detentions later."Gee, I can sure feel the love. How about everyone else?" Daphne said sarcastically.Tracey nodded in agreement. "I hate being stared at like they expect us to attack them or something.""They're just jealous because we are the best house." Draco Malfoy informed them as he and Theodore Nott turned their attention to them."We're also smarter and more talented, of course they hate us." Theo quipped, causing Tracey to giggle."So Potter, you're a snake. Who would have ever thought?" Draco said with a smirk. "You better not try and sabotage us with the points Potter."Harry decided not to mention that Ron had thought that would be a good idea. "I wouldn't do that." He said softly."Nice welcome Malfoy." Daphne said with a roll of her eyes."Why should I welcome him? He's not really a part of us and never will be. He's Potter, the boy-who-thinks-he's-so-great." Draco narrowed his silver eyes at Harry.Harry narrowed his eyes back. "You don't know a thing about me Malfoy so sod off!" He stood up and suddenly felt light-headed. He shook his head to clear it."Are you okay? You haven't eaten anything." Daphne said in concern."Why do you care Greengrass? He's a lion; they do anything to get attention." Draco scoffed."Shut up Malfoy. You're part of the problem of why Slytherin gets such a bad rap." Daphne lifted her head and stared Draco down."Whoa calm down everyone." Theo said with a quick look around. "We aren't supposed to draw negative attention or fight amongst ourselves.""You guys are making our Head of House shoot us warning looks, knock it off!" Graham Montague, the Slytherin Quidditch captain and Head Boy hissed at them. "Sit down Potter!"Harry sat and his hand went to his side again. He blinked his eyes as everything began to swim in front of him."What's wrong with you?" Theo asked with a curious look at Harry."I'm fine." Harry gave his programmed response."He hasn't eaten anything is what's wrong." Daphne put some eggs and toast on his plate. "Here. And don't worry, not everyone in Slytherin is like Malfoy here.""Hey!" Draco protested. He gave Theo a dirty when he laughed. "It's not my fault most people are inferior to me.""Get over yourself Malfoy." Tracey rolled her brown eyes.Harry was amused and a little surprised that he wasn't being completely treated like dirt on the floor. Well, Malfoy's attitude was expected. They had never gotten along and never would.Harry managed to eat a few bites of breakfast but could not manage much. He pushed away his plate and as he did a folded piece of parchment landed in front of him. Remembering the last time this happened Harry hesitantly opened the note.Mr. PotterPlease report to the infirmary for a full check up that I insist all my Slytherins have. Madam Pomfrey will be expecting you after your last class.Professor SnapeHarry's heart began to pound. He couldn't go to the infirmary! Pomfrey would find out he was wearing a glamour! And a full check-up? What all would that show? I can't go, Harry thought desperately. He'd have to skip it and hope Snape didn't press the issue. After all, it wasn't like Snape actually considered him a real Slytherin. He doubted the man would actually care if he went or not. And that was a good thing because Harry couldn't risk anyone finding out about his injuries, past or present.TBC: Please review if you get a chance! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you for the reviews!Classes were interesting. Harry kept automatically going to sit with the Gryffindors and had to be reminded that he was a Slytherin now. He was ignored for the most part by his fellow housemates. Draco just kept sneering in his direction although Daphne and Tracey were nice to him. Theo just kept looking at him curiously and Vincent Grabbe and Gregory Goyle looked like they didn't know how to act around him. Harry was happy to see Ron and Hermione in some of his classes and they waved and smiled at him.Potions class was a different experience. Harry had only just slid into his seat when Snape entered. Snape had stared at him and opened his mouth but then snapped it shut. He had then turned away from Harry and began class. Harry had resisted the urge to laugh as he knew that if he was still in Gryffindor, points would have been taken away from him even though he had technically been on time. It was the first time in a potion's class that Harry wasn't snapped at or ridiculed. It was actually a nice change.After classes were over Harry met Ron and Hermione in the library. He ignored the fact he was supposed to be in the infirmary. He would fight tooth and nail to avoid it."How's it going so far?" Hermione asked anxiously.Harry shrugged. "So far it's okay. I haven't been to the Slytherin Tower yet though. But breakfast and lunch weren't too bad."Ron looked disbelieving. "You can tell us the truth. They were all horrible to you weren't they?"Harry shook his head. "No, I met a couple of nice people. Draco was his usual self though. Although it seems that some of his housemates see right through him and don't think he's the greatest thing ever.""Probably only Draco thinks that." Hermione said as she opened her Transfiguration text book. "He has to buy people new brooms for them to like him."Ron and Harry snickered. The boys spent most of the time in the library playing chess although Harry couldn't concentrate as his vision once again blurred. He felt like he was starting to drift in and out of awareness and that was scaring him. His friends were concerned but he assured them it was just because he hadn't eaten much due to nervousness. When he left to finally go to his new Tower, his friend's watched him go with worry.HPHPHPHPWhen Harry arrived in the common room, he looked around remembering being here before with Ron last year when they thought Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin. Graham had showed him around and led him to his new dorm which was done all in dark green and silver."You'll be sharing the dorm with Draco, Theo, Vincent and Gregory." Graham said. He pointed to one bed neatly made. "That is yours. You should also be informed of the Slytherin Code.""You have a code?" Harry asked curiously.Graham nodded. "We stick together and protect our own. No fighting amount ourselves and if you have a disagreement with someone in the house you keep it in the Tower, never show it outside to everyone else. You're included in this now."Harry had to admit that it sounded nice. He doubted any of the Slytherins would follow that code concerning him but it was nice that they had it. He wished Gryffindor had something like that. They tried to watch out for their own but it wasn't something official, like Slytherin has. He thanked Graham and checked that his belongings were there. After grabbing a text book to read he went into the common room and sat down, trying to ignore stares and whispers that were sent his way. After awhile most of the Slytherins drifted off to get ready for dinner and it was just Harry, Daphne, Tracey, Draco and Theo left in the common room."Is there a reason Mr. Potter that you were not at the infirmary?" Snape entered the common room and glared at Harry.Harry inwardly groaned. He had been hoping Snape would think he had gone and that Pomfrey would be too busy to mention it. He couldn't let anyone know…"I'm waiting Potter." Snape said impatiently."I'm not sick. I don't need to go to the infirmary." Harry finally said, staring down at his book."I told you, you spoiled brat, that all my Slytherins are required to have a full check-up regardless if they are sick or not. What part of my wording confused you, hmm?" Snape said sarcastically.Draco smirked as he watched the exchange. Potter thought he was so special. At least Professor Snape would make sure he knew that he wasn't special at all."Nothing confused me sir." Harry said stiffly. "I don't want the check up.""Too bad. It is my policy with my Slytherins." Snape gritted his teeth. The brat was infuriating."It's a good thing I'm not really a Slytherin then!" Harry shot back. He couldn't have that check up. If he did, everyone would know!"Detention! You are lucky that I do not take points from my Slytherins." Snape shot back. A cruel smile formed. "Perhaps I will take points from Gryffindor since you still consider yourself one. A hundred points from-""No!" Harry stood up. He couldn't let that happen to Gryffindor. He took a shaky breath. "Please sir. I just don't…please." He looked up at Snape, pleading in his eyes.Snape had to look away. Lily's eyes. "I will escort you now since I can't trust you to go on your own." Snape was curious as to why Potter was so against going. There was no way he had anything to hide as he was spoiled and coddled at home. All Snape could think was that he was doing it to get attention. Just like his father, Snape thought in disgust."Aw, poor baby Potty is afraid of the infirmary. I thought it was your home away from home, you end up there so much." Draco scoffed, causing Theo to laugh. Daphne was staring at Harry, her blue eyes narrowed in thought."Are you wearing a glamour Harry?" Daphne finally asked. It had been bothering her all day. She had known something was off during breakfast and lunch.Snape looked at Harry in surprise. He stared for a moment and with a sinking feeling realized that Miss. Greengrass was right. Without remembering that they had an audience Snape withdrew his wand. "Finite Incantatem."Harry shut his eyes as he felt the glamour fall away. He heard gasps of shock."Po-Potter?" Snape stepped forward in concern. The boy's face was bruised, eyes were glazed over, bruises on his arms, and he was very pale and much too thin. Snape couldn't believe he had missed this. I always know! He thought in shock. He could always see the signs even with students not in his house.Draco couldn't believe it. Potter looked like he had been worked over but good. What in Merlin's name had happened to him?Daphne was staring at Harry with her hand over her mouth. Who did this to him? He must be in so much pain and he didn't say anything, she thought sadly."Let's go to the infirmary Potter." Snape said quietly."I don't want everyone else to see. Please." Harry whispered, feeling humiliated. Now they knew how weak he really was. He would never live this down.Snape nodded in understanding and replaced the glamour for the moment. He then led Harry out of the room."Was he beat up here? Someone in our house?" Theo wondered out loud."Or maybe someone from another house angry that he is here." Tracey suggested.Daphne shook her head. "No, those bruises looked old. Several days, maybe even a week old. Which would mean-""His family." Draco said, still shocked. Was it possible? The boy wonder was abused?HPHPHPHP"There you are. My time is important as well you know." Poppy grumbled when she saw Severus lead Harry into her infirmary.Snape threw her a glare. He made sure the infirmary had no one else in it and then waved his wand locking the doors and casting a silencing charm so that no could overhear. "Sit down Potter." He said. He took a deep breath and removed the glamour, not surprised when Poppy gave a gasp."What happened? Was he in a fight?" Poppy began waving her wand over Harry, running several diagnostics. A parchment began forming. "These happened before school started. What happened to you Mr. Potter?"Harry stayed silent. "I fell." He finally said, wincing at how stupid that sounded."Of course. Because those injuries are consistent with a simple fall." Snape sneered. He had heard excuses like these many times before."Severus." Poppy murmured. The parchment had grown quite long. Her eyes widened. "I need to get several potions. Mr. Potter lay down now."As Poppy began hurriedly gathering vials from her cupboard, Snape read the parchment that she had produced. Potter was bleeding internally, his spleen ruptured. How had the boy been able to keep going with passing out? His magic, Severus thought. If one was strong enough their magic would work to fix them if they were hurt or sick. Potter's accidental magic had been pulled forth and was trying to heal him.Snape read the rest of the diagnostic. It was clear that Potter had been abused and neglected since he was a toddler. Severe malnutrition, dehydration, bruises, sprained bones, a broken arm, burns, cuts and currently bruises on his face, arms and side. His ribs were bruised and he had a high fever. Snape flicked his dark eyes up at Harry, who had laid down and was looking embarrassed. "Don't do that.""Do what?" Harry asked in confusion."Do not look embarrassed." Snape said flatly. He knew what to say to abuses students. But this was Potter. He was supposed to be spoiled and arrogant like his father. "The only ones who should be embarrassed are the ones who did this to you." And those who failed to notice, Snape finished silently. "Your relatives, I presume?"Harry bit his lip and nodded, for the third time in his life admitting to the abuse.Snape struggled to control his anger. He was furious at the boy's relatives, angry at Minerva for not checking her students, angry with Dumbledore for putting Harry with his relatives and obviously not checking up on him. But most of all he was angry at himself. He had promised to protect the boy for Lily. Despite treating Potter the way he did, he had done what he could to protect him at school. He had not thought that Potter needed protection at home."Can you tell me what caused these current injuries?" Snape asked as Poppy came back.Harry hesitated. "The summer started out like usual."Snape nodded. Meaning the usual abuse, he thought darkly.Harry sighed. "But then I accidently blew up Aunt Marge. My uncle hit me. I ran away before Uncle Vernon could really make me pay for it. Then Fudge sent me back even though I told him and showed him the bruise on my face. He said there was nothing wrong with having strict guardians and that basically I deserved it and should accept whatever they do to me.""What!" Poppy was lived as she returned lining up vials on the table next to Harry's bed.Harry flinched slightly and without thinking Snape put his hand on his shoulder. "It's okay Mr. Potter. No one is mad at you. What happened after that moron sent you back?"Harry gave a faint smile as he drank the first vial Pomfrey handed him. "My side was already sore from Dudley punching me and Uncle Vernon punched me in the stomach and kicked me in the side." He began to feel very drowsy. "No food just some water…chores…was locked up for while...hit and slapped...no one believes...no one cares." Harry fell asleep.Poppy's face was grim, her eyes glinted in anger. "He's bleeding internally Severus. His spleen has been ruptured. How he hasn't collapsed by now I don't know.""His magic kicked in and is trying to heal him." Snape said quietly.Poppy gave a deep sigh. "Of course. It's just been awhile since I've seen a case this bad. If he didn't have his magic Severus…""I know." Snape said. If it wasn't for the child's magic trying to help him, Potter would have succumbed to his injuries long ago."I can't believe I didn't see it!" Poppy said as she began working healing charms over Harry. "He's been in here enough the past two years, I should have done a full check up on him. I noticed he was very thin at the start of school but I figured it was because Hogwarts has such grand feasts that most children probably lose weight during the summer. But look at this!" She banished Harry's shirt where they could see more bruises and how thin the child was. "I can practically count his bones he is so malnourished."Snape took a deep breath at the sight. This was completely unacceptable! "I believe his magic cast the glamour on him no doubt answering to his fear of people finding out. If he had had a full health check as a first year we would have known about the years of abuse."Poppy nodded with a guilty look on her face. "I should just perform the scans even if their Head of House do not ask for it. I should insist to the Headmaster that it should be protocol!"Snape remained silent. He never understood why he was the only Head of House that insisted on checking their student's full health. There were abused cases in every house though most did end up in Slytherin as they had to learn cunning skills to hide their abuse. Unfortunately most of his colleagues, like the Headmaster, had a hard time fathoming that parents or guardians would hurt their child in such a way. Poppy had finally seen the truth when he was a student and did her best to help him. She had informed Dumbledore and he had tried to help as well.As Poppy healed the internal injuries on Harry repairing his spleen and spelling into him a blood replenisher, Snape picked up the bruise balm and began spreading it on the boy's face and arms. After Poppy finished, she helped him apply the balm to Harry's left side where it was a deep purple and his back.Snape saw that once the bruises began to disappear there were scars on Potter's back. He gritted his teeth to hold back his anger and summoned a scar removal cream. He applied it gently and thoroughly until the marks slowly vanished. He summoned another potion. "I would like to start him on a nutritive potion." He looked at Poppy.Poppy nodded grimly. "Yes, he will need to take that for awhile. He may need a stomach soother when he eats as his body is not used to food and it will take some time before he can eat a full meal."Snape nodded and spelled the nutritive potion into Harry. "I will make sure his meals are catered to him as he will need to start with more bland meals.""I'd like for him to stay the night so that I can monitor him." Poppy said as she spelled a fever reducer into Harry. "He will sleep through the night which is good as his body is still healing."Snape nodded. "I need to speak with Albus. I'll come back and check on him in the morning. If anything happens let me know right away." He turned and swept away.HPHPHPHP"Hello Severus. How can I help you?" Albus asked when Snape entered his office."Potter." Snape said, finally let the anger he felt make his way known.Dumbledore sighed. "It has not even been twenty-four hours. I thought you could hold out a little longer than that.""Potter is in the infirmary." Snape said coldly. "I'm afraid you neglected to inform me that he was an abused child.""I beg your pardon?" Dumbledore looked truly shocked."He's been abused." Snape said again. He held out the parchment that showed Harry's medical history.Dumbledore read silently, his normally twinkling eyes growing dark. He had known that Petunia had not cared for Harry the way he had hoped but this…he had not expected this. He had completely failed the boy."Did you ever have Potter checked on as a child?" Snape demanded."Arabella lives across the street from the Dursley's. If she had seen anything she would have told me." Dumbledore said evenly."She would have seen what Potter wanted her to see. Children learn very quickly to cover the abuse." Snape said stiffly. He had learned to as child. How strange to have something in common with Potter. He just wished it was not this. Anything but this. "How often did she see him? Was she ever in his home?"Dumbledore sighed regretfully. "No. She would occasionally babysit when the Dursley's went on vacation."Snape raised an eyebrow. "They didn't take Potter on vacation? And that did not raise any questions?""I knew Harry wasn't being cared for the way I wanted. He was thin and small even for an eleven year old. But I assure you Severus I had no idea that he had suffered all this." Dumbledore looked every bit his age as he looked at Snape. "How is he?"Severus sat down across from Dumbledore and ran a hand over his face. "Asleep right now. Poppy healed the internal bleeding and we applied bruise balm and scar removal to him. We spelled nutritive potion and fever reducer into him. He needs to gain weight and catch up on sleep." He looked at Dumbledore almost accusingly. "He said this latest…incident occurred after he accidently blew up his Aunt. He told Fudge why he didn't want to go back to his relatives, even showed him the bruise his Uncle had left on his face. Fudge sent him home anyway.""I see." Dumbledore said quietly. "We were worried about Sirius being out there and Cornelius probably thought he would be safer with his relatives despite the bruise.""You do not understand. It is very hard for a child of abuse to tell someone. Potter took the chance and not only did Fudge dismiss it, he apparently implied the boy deserved it!" Snape seethed.Dumbledore looked surprised. "I am sure Cornelius didn't-""He will not return to his relatives." Snape cut in, staring at Dumbledore.Dumbledore took a deep breath. "The blood wards-""Mean nothing if Potter is killed by his muggle relatives." Snape interrupted. "That is where this is leading. If his magic had not kicked in trying to heal him, he would be dead by now. I'd also wonder how strong those wards actually are if there is no love to sustain them. Lily gave her life for her son so he could live and be cared for. She would never stand for this! And neither will I.""I'm surprised to hear you advocate so strongly for Harry." Dumbledore remarked. He realized that was a bad move on his part when the room practically shook with Severus's anger, his magic almost crackling around him."I made a promise on my life to protect that boy. I have not treated him kindly or liked him but I have protected him. I never stand for abuse for any child and especially not Potter. Not Lily's son!" Snape hissed.Dumbledore stared back at him and then nodded. "I will need a guardian who is adequate for Harry. Someone powerful enough to protect him, to offer him strong enough protection that the blood wards did. Someone who can guide him, care for him and help him through his abuse. Someone who can truly focus on him. Unfortunately, I cannot think of someone who meets all of those requirements." He tilted his head. "Well, I can think of one person but I fear for my life if I ask him." Dumbledore kept a steady look on his Potions Professor.Snape looked away. He should have known. The truth was he did meet the requirements. He was fully invested in seeing Potter stay safe and make it to adulthood. And if the Dark Lord did come back and war started again, he would do what it took to see Potter through it. He owed Lily that. He knew her heart would break if she knew all Potter had been through. That would mean though, that Snape would have to adjust his thinking about the boy. He had only let himself see Potter as James Potter junior as it made him feel better to take points and give unfair punishments. Was it petty? Of course it was but Snape never claimed to be perfect or even a good person. He had done horrible things in the past that he could never make up for. The only thing he could do now was honor his promise he had made in Lily's memory. The only true friend he had ever had and the only woman he had really loved. Her son was hurt and Snape had to do what he could to help him. The truth was as soon as he had seen that broken child who was bruised and battered, Potter had ceased to remind him of James. James had been spoiled and loved by his family and had not known pain or rejection.Dumbledore had been watching him thoughtfully. "Of course if the person I am thinking of became Harry's guardian, then he wouldn't be able to do certain other duties that may come up in the future."Snape stiffened. He knew that if the Dark Lord came back he would go back to spying. It was not something he wanted to do but he would do it to get information that would help protect Potter. How could he be Potter's guardian and a death eater?"We do not know when Voldemort will come back. And Harry needs a guardian now. Someone who can also help train him to defend himself. I can work on other ways of getting information besides using you Severus." Dumbledore said quietly. He would have to work on getting another spy or find another way to get the information when it was time.Albus knew he had already failed Harry in an unforgivable way. He knew Severus would protect Harry with his life as well as help him deal with the abuse he had suffered. His two boys would be good for each other. They both needed a family. It wouldn't be easy though, as they were both stubborn and in the last two years animosity had built.Snape closed his eyes and Lily's beautiful face floated through. For you Lily, he thought. Always for you. He opened his eyes and looked at Dumbledore. "I'll do it. I will become Potter's new guardian."TBC: Please be kind I'm a little nervous about this chapter! =) And Merry Christmas!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you to those who have reviewed, I enjoy hearing from you! Happy New Year! =)"It must be pretty bad if he stayed the night in the infirmary." Daphne said to Draco, Tracey and Theo the next morning as they sat in the corner of the Slytherin common room. They were the only ones who knew about Harry's condition.Theo nodded. "The bruises looked pretty bad.""He was so thin." Tracey murmured. "He also looked feverish."Draco was quiet for a moment. He had hated Potter since he rejected his friendship the first day of Hogwarts. If he was honest with himself, he was jealous of him. Potter was so fawned over at school he had figured his family doted on him too. Draco had never been hit by his parents. His father could be cold and aloof and would lecture soundly if he thought Draco had brought shame to the Malfoy name in anyway but he had never hit him. His mother, though people thought the opposite, was much more warm in her affection for her son. While Draco feared disappointing his parents, he had never had cause to fear them. He knew many students in Slytherin and likely in other houses were not so lucky. But the boy hero? It seemed so unlikely. He wondered if Potter had fainted on the train because of his injuries. Draco felt an unfamiliar emotion. Guilt.Daphne was also lost in thought. She had known something was off she just wished she had figured it out sooner. She had been through it herself although not to the degree Harry had. I hope he is okay, she thought worriedly."Breakfast is going to start soon." Theo said. "Maybe he'll be there?""I hope so." Daphne said as she followed her friends out of the tower.HPHPHPHP"How are you feeling today Mr. Potter?" Snape asked as he entered the infirmary. He had decided to wait awhile before telling Potter that he was his new guardian. The boy was going through enough as it was and needed time to learn to trust him. Not that I have made that easy, Snape thought with a sigh. None of this was going to be easy."I'm fine." Harry said automatically, wanting to leave the infirmary. Merlin, he hated the infirmary. He was so embarrassed that Snape knew the truth. That probably the whole school knew by now.Snape raised an eyebrow. "I'll ask again and I do not want that programmed response. How are you feeling?"Harry stared at him with a bemused expression. "I feel better. No pain, actually. It's been awhile since I haven't felt any-"He shook his head. "I'm better sir."Snape stared at him for a moment and again realized that this wasn't just Potter, James son but a child. A child who apparently was used to being in pain. "Breakfast finished a little bit ago. Have you eaten yet?""No, I always starve my patients." Poppy came in and looked at Snape exasperatedly. She ran her wand over Harry and nodded in approval. "Your internal injuries have completely healed. All your bruises and scars have as well."Harry looked at her in surprise. "My scars are gone?" His hand automatically reached behind him to his back."The scar removal cream I make is particularly advanced. The only thing it wouldn't work on would be unique curse scars." Snape told him, his dark eyes briefly looking at Harry's forehead. He tried to not look affected by the way Potter's eyes had lit up at the news that the physical scars of his abuse were gone. If only the internal scars of abuse were as easy to heal."Thank you sir." Harry said sincerely.Snape was briefly taken off guard and simply nodded in return."Your fever is now gone. You will need to continue the nutrition potion however, every morning at breakfast until I or Professor Snape say otherwise." Poppy continued.Harry nodded resignedly. "Yes Ma'am.""You are free to leave Mr. Potter." Poppy said. "I do recommend that you rest all day.""Thank you." Harry said in relief. He wondered if he could go to the Gryffindor tower to visit his friends."Head back to the common room Potter. Your housemates have been wondering where you have been." Snape ordered.Harry gave a start at calling Slytherins his housemates. "Does everyone know?" His tone indicated that he assumed they did.Snape shook his head. "When asked, I merely said you weren't feeling well. The only ones who know are Malfoy, Nott, Davis and Greengrass and all they know is what they saw." Snape hesitated. "I did inform the headmaster, as is protocol."Harry shrugged. "He knew already didn't he? In the scheme of things, having some bruises doesn't matter."Before Snape could reply to everything wrong with what the boy had said, Harry walked out of the infirmary.HPHPHPHPHarry reluctantly gave the password to the Slytherin common room wishing it was Gryffindor instead. "Callidus." He muttered and the wall formed a door which opened. He stepped in and was aware of looks being given his way."There you are." Pansy Parkinson said in a snotty voice. "Already separating yourself from us? Is Potty to good to be a Slytherin?""He's not a Slytherin." Blaise Zabini laughed. "It's a joke that he is here."Harry looked at Blaise evenly. "That we agree on." He turned to make his way to his dorm when he was stopped by Daphne Greengrass."Are you all right?" Her blue eyes were looking him over in concern.Harry ran a hand through his hair. "I'm fine. I mean, better." He looked at her in confusion still having a hard time grasping that Slytherins were being nice to him. "You weren't actually worried were you? I kind of thought you guys would have told what you saw.""Apparently you don't know us as well as you think you do Mr. Potter." Daphne countered. "Slytherins look after their own. And whether you like it or not, you are currently a Slytherin. I thought I explained this to you already.""But everyone here hates me!" Harry protested. "For two years I have been taunted by Slytherins. And since I'm known for getting rid of Voldemort- "Daphne flinched."Are you afraid of his name?" Harry asked in surprise.Daphne nodded reluctantly. "I'm afraid he will come back someday.""You are? I thought you would want him back. I mean, I figured all your parents were his followers and…I guess I thought-" Harry stammered, feeling foolish."That all Slytherins are evil?" Daphne finished. "No Potter. Not every student in this house wants to be a death eater. Some of us act a certain way in front of others because, well, we are expected to be the bad ones." She shrugged. "Even most of the Professors treat us differently."Harry frowned. Honestly, he had not paid much attention to how Slytherins were treated by the teachers.Daphne nodded. "I do have to wonder how they will treat you." Her face softened. "Have you had breakfast?"Harry nodded. "Apparently I need to gain weight." He said with a grin."You do. You're a stick." Daphne informed him, though her tone was light and teasing."Ah Greengrass, showing your rude side." Draco drawled as he and Theo came to stand next to them.Daphne stuck her tongue out. "Shut it.""You look normal again." Theo stated. Draco cuffed him on the back of the head and Daphne glared at him."Oh sorry, I guess that came out rude." Theo said sheepishly.Harry couldn't help but laugh. He was still a bit wary as to why they were being actually nice to him though."I just mean that you show no signs of…being hurt." Theo explained with an apologetic look."It's amazing what potions can do. Almost like magic." Harry quipped.Draco and Theo snorted while Daphne and Tracey rolled their eyes."Hmm maybe you should eat again. Daphne's right you do look like a stick." Draco said, eyeing him critically. Potter's clothes hung on him like a tent.Harry shrugged. "I'm not hungry." And what do you care? He finished in his head."So do your friends know?" Draco asked bluntly.This time Theo cuffed Draco on the back of the head."Really Draco, you are lucky we put up with you because," Daphne frowned. "Wait, why do we put up with him?" She asked Theo and Tracey.Tracey shrugged. "No idea.""His Mum sends him really good treats to share." Theo answered."I thank you for your kind words." Draco made a face. He looked at Harry a little hesitantly. "I just wondered if they knew since you three are so close. And if they did why didn't they…" Why didn't they tell someone? His mind finished.Harry bit his lip. "They don't know." He admitted. The Slytherins looked shocked. "They know a little but not the worst of it. I didn't want to burden them." His eyes widened. "You won't tell them will you?""We aren't going to tell anyone. You're a Slytherin now Potter and we look out for our own." Theo said firmly.Daphne was curious as to why Harry didn't want his best friends to know and opened her mouth to ask when she was interrupted."Hey guys, what's going on?" Two younger girls joined the little group smiling brightly.Harry's emerald eyes widened in alarm."We were just telling Potter that we are glad that he is feeling better." Daphne said smoothly. "He had a touch of the flu last night.""Oh, I hate the flu." One of the girls, who looked like Daphne, nodded. "Glad you are feeling better Potter.""Thanks." Harry managed to say. They're being too nice! His mind screamed."This is my little sister Astoria. She is in her first year." Daphne introduced. "And this is Tabitha Bainbridge, also in her first year."Harry smiled kindly at them. "It's nice to meet you. Are you enjoying Hogwarts so far?"Astoria nodded eagerly. She had blonde hair and blue eyes like her sister, yet her hair was a darker blonde and her eyes more of a pale blue. "I love it, it is so exciting! Although yesterday I had History of Magic and I almost fell asleep!"Harry laughed. "Hate to tell you but that class doesn't get any better. It's a good place to catch up on homework though.""I'm still so happy to be here. I hated having to wait to start Hogwarts. I wanted to come when Daffy did." Astoria beamed. She clearly looked up to her big sister."Tori!" Daphne hissed at her little sister, her face flushing with embarrassment. "I told you not to call me that here!"Astoria blushed. "Oops, sorry Daff-Daphne."Tracey and Theo were snickering while Draco and Harry had burst into laughter."Oh that's rich!" Draco gasped."I better never hear any of you say that name!" Daphne threatened. She glared at Draco who was laughing the loudest. "Understand me Dray?"Draco returned her glare. "Don't call me that! Fine, I won't say anything."Harry was quite amused and looked at Daphne. "Dray?" He mouthed.Daphne grinned and nodded."Thanks for the laugh Astoria." Draco said with a smirk.Harry noticed Astoria blush."Hey Potter, Professor Snape wants to see you in his office." Graham Montague called to him.Harry made a face. "Great." He muttered. He looked at the group of people around him. "See you guys later.""Harry." Daphne followed Harry to the door. "I know you have issues with Professor Snape, but in this situation trust him. Believe me, he wants to help.""How do you know?" Harry asked his voice tense. Daphne just looked at him, her dark blue eyes a little sad. "Oh." Harry said as understanding hit him. He felt like an idiot. "Thank you Daphne." He gave her a mischievous grin. "Or should I say Daffy?"Daphne scowled yet her eyes were amused. "Watch it Potter."Harry couldn't help but laugh as he headed out of the common room.HPHPHPHP"Come in Mr. Potter." Snape gestured to the chair in front of his desk."You wanted to see me Professor?" Harry asked his tone wary."I take it you are still feeling well?" Snape asked, leaning back in his chair.Harry nodded. "Yes sir.""I know it has only been a day but are you finding it hard to settle in with Slytherin?" Snape asked, curious to how the child was fitting in. He wasn't naïve to think all his Slytherins would take the lecture he gave about accepting Potter into their house to heart but he was sure some of his students would. Despite what other's thought, he had some really good kids in his house."Better than I thought I would." Harry admitted. "I think I may have made some friends. Maybe."Snape nodded, looking pleased. "I thought we should discuss more of what led to your injuries." Snape said evenly. He had never in years would have thought he would be having this conversation with Potter. "As well as injuries you had in your childhood." He tapped the parchment that detailed Potter's health history."We don't have to." Harry quickly said. "It doesn't matter.""Actually it does." Snape countered. "What has happened to you matters a lot Mr. Potter. You indicated that the Headmaster knew about your relative's abuse. He knew your aunt and uncle weren't…caring for you the way he had hoped. But he did not know how bad it was.""Or maybe he didn't want to know." Harry shrugged. He really didn't want talk about this.Snape didn't say anything. The truth was he was still upset with Albus. The Headmaster should have made sure that Harry's muggle relatives were treating him properly. That was the problem with many muggle-born children unfortunately. Their parents or guardians grew to be afraid of their accidental magic and tried to beat it out of them or simply abandoned them. Snape knew Petunia had been jealous of Lily and her magic but when Albus had said she had taken in Potter he assumed that meant Petunia would revel in taking care of the boy hero of the Wizarding world. He remembered how Lily had told him that Petunia wanted to attend Hogwarts. He had assumed Petunia would view raising Potter as her chance to be a part of the world she had longed to be in as a child and therefore would have spoiled him. I should have checked as well, he thought regretfully."I would like to know. You are not the first student who has had these issues." Snape told him. "It's important to talk about it Mr. Potter."Harry leaned back in his seat and sighed. "I really don't see how it would help. They hate me and made sure I knew it. That's all.""That's all? They starved you and hurt for years. They caused cuts and burns and bruises. They caused internal bleeding. It also says here you had a broken arm when you were seven years old." Snape held up the parchment."Kids fall and break bones all the time." Harry said, his voice rising a bit.Snape narrowed his dark eyes at him. He expected the defensive attitude. It was hard to control how he usually spoke to Potter however. It was a habit for him to snap at him. "Tell me about it." He said, working to keep his voice calm.Harry stood up. "I don't want to talk about this.""Tell me about the broken arm, the truth, and I won't ask anything else about it for the rest of the weekend." Snape bargained.Harry sat down slowly, remembering what Daphne had said about trusting Snape. He would try but it was hard to imagine Snape being someone he could trust. Trusting any adults was a rare thing for him. "I was running away from my cousin and his gang and I ended up on the school roof. The teachers thought I climbed up there but the truth was I didn't know how I ended up there. My Aunt and Uncle knew and were furious. My Uncle-"He closed his eyes as the memories swam in his mind."Go on." Snape said softly."He yelled, called me a freak. He slapped me and I started crying." Harry's face turned red with embarrassment. "He got mad that I was crying and he grabbed my arm, shaking me and then threw me against the wall. Hard. There was a loud snap and my arm was really hurting. He then threw me into my cupboard and locked me in." Harry's eyes were slightly glazed as he was lost in the memory.Snape longed to have two minutes alone with Mr. Dursley. Actually, one minute would be plenty. "Your cupboard?" He asked softly.Harry nodded, still lost in thought. "Yeah, it was my room until-"Harry frowned. "Wait, you said all I had to tell you about was my arm.""Oh, that's right I did." Snape said smoothly. "Thank you for your honesty Mr. Potter. Before you go there is one thing I would like to make sure you understand."Harry had already stood up, anxious to leave. "What is that Professor?""Your relatives were wrong in how they treated you. You didn't deserve it. No child deserves it." Snape looked at him piercingly. "They are despicable for hurting you the way they did."Harry simply stared at him.Snape turned his attention to the papers on his desk. "You may go now Mr. Potter." He still didn't feel it was time to tell Potter about his change of guardian. Besides, he still had to get the Dursley's to sign the right papers. He was personally looking forward to that visit.Harry hurried to the door but then stopped short and turned around. "Thank you sir." He disappeared out the door.Snape stared at the shut door for a moment. It was not much but it was a start.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much to those who have reviewed, I really appreciate it!After his meeting with Snape, Harry realized it was lunchtime and headed to the Great Hall. He was stopped as soon as he entered."Where were you last night? We didn't see you at dinner!" Hermione said anxiously, her eyes scrutinizing him."What did those slimy snakes do?" Ron wanted to know with a scowl on his freckled face.Harry gave a little sigh and then shot them a reassuring smile. "No one did anything. I'm fine. I just felt a little sick last night. Touch of the flu or something." He said casually. He hated lying to them but it was hard to tell the truth after two years of hiding it from them."Oh." Hermione said sheepishly. "Sorry. We were worried.""It's okay." Harry smiled. "How are you guys?"Ron shrugged. "It's weird without you mate.""We miss you. Everyone has been asking how you are." Hermione added."Almost everyone." Ron practically growled.Harry looked between the two of them in confusion. "What do you mean?""It's no big deal Harry. The situation is just still new." Hermione said."Ahh." Harry nodded. "I take it McLaggen and his friends still think I should have dropped out of school instead of being put in Slytherin?"Ron and Hermione's uncomfortable look was enough to answer his question. "It's okay; I don't care what they think." He assured them. "Actually there are some nice people in Slytherin."Ron shook his head sadly. "I knew this would happen.""What?" Harry asked."Well," Hermione hedged. "Ron is worried, and so am I, that you may be tricked by them. You believe the best in people Harry and-""Don't trust them. There is no best in them." Ron interrupted. "Don't let them make a fool of you. We don't want you to get hurt."Harry shook his head. "Don't worry. I am still wary of them but I believe some are nice. I think I might even be making some friends."Ron's expression showed what he thought of that statement but before he could say anything Dean and Seamus joined them."Hey Harry!" Dean thumped him hard on the back and Harry automatically winced a little before he remembered he didn't hurt anymore. He didn't have scars anymore. Well, except for his lightning bolt scar."Are you allowed to sit with us? You deserve a break." Seamus said."I doubt it. I think I'm supposed to get used to my new house." Harry answered. How could he explain that it was actually a little easier to be around some of his housemates then them now because they knew the truth about him?"Hi Harry! Are you on your way to our table?" Astoria asked as she stopped by him, Tabitha next to her.Before Harry could answer, Dean interrupted her. "You shouldn't interrupt snake!""Dean!" Harry glared at him and then gave Astoria a reassuring smile. "I'll be right there. Will you save a spot for me?"Astoria, whose face had fallen at Dean's words, perked back up. "Sure! Come on Tabitha!"Harry turned back to Dean. "She's eleven. You don't have to be mean to her."Dean shrugged. "A snake is a snake. They're all like Malfoy aren't they?""No, they aren't." Harry answered shortly. The truth was he didn't know who Malfoy really was. He had so far been decent despite having something to use against him."Harry's right. You shouldn't be mean like that to a first year." Hermione frowned.Dean rolled his eyes."I'll see you guys later. I'm getting hungry." Harry said, offering his friends a smile and heading to the Slytherin table. He smiled when he saw that Astoria had indeed saved him a seat. Daphne was sitting with her and gave him a concerned look when he sat down."Astoria looked upset when she was with your friends." Daphne commented as she handed Harry a plate."That one boy was rude to her." Tabitha volunteered."Which boy?" Daphne demanded.Tabitha pointed Dean out and Daphne frowned. "What did he say Tori?""It's nothing Daphne." Astoria said, uncomfortable now that several of the students sitting around were listening to them."I'd like to know too." Draco scowled in Dean's direction."He called her a snake and said she shouldn't interrupt." Tabitha once again answered for Astoria.Astoria shrugged. "We are snakes. It's our symbol like there is a lion."Draco sighed. "Yes, but he didn't mean it in a good way.""It's okay. Harry stood up for me." Astoria said happily.Daphne shot Harry a look of gratitude. "Thank you." She said quietly. She lowered her voice to where only Harry could hear her. "I was actually hoping Tori would be sorted into a different house. I didn't want anyone being mean to her simply because she is a Slytherin." She shot a fond look in her sister's direction. "She loves to read so much I thought she would be in Ravenclaw.""I wonder if the sorting hat gave her a choice." Harry mused, thinking of his own sorting.Daphne shot him a surprised look. "I don't think the sorting hat does that." She paused. "Does it?"Harry shrugged one shoulder. "It did with me.""Really? I would very much like to hear that story." Daphne said as she put a sandwich on her plate. She frowned at Harry's still empty plate. "What do you want to eat?"Harry glanced at the food on the table and even though all summer he had dreamed of Hogwarts food he now felt a little sick at the thought of eating. Before he could decide food suddenly appeared on his plate. It was porridge with fruit on top and a glass of milk. Harry looked at the food in surprise and then lifted his eyes up to the Head Table. Snape was watching him and gave him a nod.Harry cautiously took a bite of the porridge and to his surprise it went down easy. It had a hint of honey and cinnamon in it yet was not heavy. It tasted good and as Harry ate small bites he was happy that his stomach was not protesting it.Daphne seemed satisfied that he was eating and returned to their conversation. "So, tell me about your sorting." She looked thoughtful. "It took awhile, if I remember correctly."Harry nodded. "Yeah. The house it mentioned I didn't want to be put in so it finally sorted me into Gryffindor."Daphne put her sandwich down. "A house you didn't want to be put in? Don't tell me…Slytherin? You were supposed to be put in Slytherin?" She looked shocked."If I was really supposed to be put here in Slytherin it would have wouldn't it? It wouldn't change its mind just because of me begging it to." Harry said. That probably came out pretty offending, he thought guiltily.However, Daphne began laughing. "I can't believe it! You were supposed to be here all along!""No, I'm a Gryffindor." Harry insisted. "It's just the hat said I could be great here or something like that. But I had met Malfoy and he reminded me of my cousin so I didn't want to be in the same house as him."Daphne glared in Draco's direction. "Prat." She sighed. "Draco is conceited but he is not as bad as he acts to the other houses.""Really? Because he called my friend Hermione a mudblood last year." Harry said frowning as he remembered how hurt Hermione had been.Daphne's eyes widened. "He shouldn't have done that. Not only is it a horrible word but if Professor Snape heard about it, Draco would have gotten into big trouble.""I thought Slytherins didn't get in trouble with Snape. I mean Professor Snape." Harry corrected himself. He had noticed that the Slytherins appeared to really respect their Head of House."Of course we do." Daphne rolled her eyes. "You're still new so you just haven't seen it yet. When he addresses us at the beginning of the year he says he does not take points or issue punishments in public due to house loyalty as well as he knows Slytherins aren't always treated fairly. But he will scold, lecture and give detention in private."Harry paused just as he was about to take another bite of porridge. "Seriously? I honestly thought-""Professor Snape is one of the strictest Professors in Hogwarts. What did you think; he would let his house run wild with no repercussions?" Theo asked as he had overheard the last part of their conversation.Yes! Harry wanted to shout. "Okay, why would he get mad at a student for saying mudblood?" He whispered the last word."Being a Slytherin does not mean taunting others or name calling. It demeans you and makes you look weak. We are supposed to show we are smarter and more cunning than that." Theo said automatically.Harry made a face. "Well, not everyone follows that. Plus Professor Snape taunts other students and calls them dunderheads." Among other things, Harry thought ruefully as he remembered all of the insults that got written on his essays."Professor Snape is strict and snarky but he also teaches one the most dangerous subjects and he has a roomful of students he has to try and keep an eye on. One wrong ingredient added or the heat turned up too high on a potion and it could explode. Never mind that there are students who goof around in his class and could cause a lot of damage. If students are afraid of him already, there is a better chance that they will behave in his class." Draco interjected as he moved over to their side of the table.Harry made a face. "You mean like students who throw the wrong ingredients into someone else's cauldron?" He gave Draco a pointed look. Theo also looked a little sheepish."Seriously? Blimey Draco you are lucky Professor Snape didn't catch you doing that!" Daphne exclaimed, shaking her head. Boys, she thought."He did." Theo muttered. "Towards the end of last year."Harry eyes widened. "He did? What did he do?"Draco looked embarrassed. "Lectured us for a half hour on how irresponsible we were being and how Slytherins knew to be smarter than how we were acting. Then he assigned lines.""That doesn't sound too bad." Harry commented. So Slytherins did get off easy, he thought triumphantly."A thousand lines with each one being the size of a paragraph doesn't sound too bad? And it had to be done by the next morning along with our usual homework?" Draco asked sarcastically.Harry's mouth dropped open.Draco sniffed. "Trying to catch flies Potter?"Daphne laughed. "I told you Harry, the only thing Professor Snape doesn't usually do is take points from us. Although I heard from some of the older kids that he has in the past though it is rare."Huh, Harry thought. Looks like many of his perceptions of how the Slytherin house was run was being proven wrong.Suddenly the Slytherin table quieted down. Harry looked up in confusion and saw Ron and Hermione approaching them."Don't tell me that because we are forced to have Potter we have to put up with them too?" Pansy glared at the approaching Gryffindors."Weasel and the –" Blaise started to say before Harry stood up."Watch it Zabini!" Harry snarled. He turned to his friends."We were wondering if you were coming to the library with us." Hermione said to him. She glanced at the Slytherin table."Sure." Harry said as he picked up his book bag. "I'm done eating." He hadn't been able to eat the whole bowl of porridge but had managed a decent portion of it.Ron grimaced as he looked at Harry's bowl of food. "Ew. Since when do you eat porridge?""Um, I just thought I would try it. It was pretty good actually." Harry hedged. "Does anyone else want to come to the library with us?"Ron looked shocked that Harry was asking the Slytherins if they wanted to come along and Hermione looked a little surprised too. She recovered quickly and nodded. "We were going to work on our transfiguration essay if anyone wants to join us."Daphne and Tracey looked at each other and then Daphne nodded. "Sure, we'll be there. I was planning on helping my sister with her potions essay so we will meet you in the library in a few minutes.""Aww I don't want to do homework today. It's Saturday!" Astoria complained."Tori, you said you needed help. Have you even started the essay yet?" Daphne asked her sister."Well, no." Astoria admitted."It's due Monday right?" Daphne continued.Astoria bit her lip. "Yes.""You will want to get started on it today. Do you really want to risk Professor Snape's wrath if you do not have it ready to hand in? Or if you hand in a substandard essay?" Draco interjected, reasoning with the first year.Astoria's eyes widened as she looked at Draco. "No, that would not be good. I'll do the essay today."Draco smiled at her and Astoria's cheeks turned pink. "Very good." Draco said approvingly."Why does she listen to him and not to me?" Daphne grumbled as she stood up from the table.Harry snickered. "You're just her sister. Draco is a boy." Harry grinned widely at Daphne's expression."No she can't have a crush on him!" Daphne looked horrified. "She's only eleven!"Harry rolled his eyes and grinned at Ron and Hermione. "Exactly. She'll get over it.""If you like we can write her an essay on all the things wrong with Malfoy. It would probably be a million page paper." Ron offered with a glare in Draco's direction.Hermione rolled her eyes and began pulling Ron away from the table. "Finally we have found a subject Ron doesn't mind writing about." As they walked away she looked over her shoulder at Harry and Daphne. "We'll see you in the library!""They seem nice." Daphne said in a slightly surprised voice as she, Tracey and Harry left the Great Hall.Harry raised an eyebrow. "Why wouldn't they be? Don't tell me you believe Gryffindor's can't be nice."Daphne flushed a little. "I guess I haven't really gotten to know any Gryffindors." She admitted. "I've made friends with a few Ravenclaws but that's it. Usually when the other students see Slytherins they either look at us suspiciously or whisper or just plain ignore us." She shrugged."I've experienced the same thing." Tracey nodded."Ron and Hermione are brilliant friends." Harry said loyally. "They've been with me through a lot. I think you two would get along with them."Daphne brightened a little at his statement. "I need to get a couple books from my dorm. We'll meet you in the library."Harry watched them go and then turned to continue his way to the library when he was brought up short. Standing in front of him was Professor Snape.Snape raised an eyebrow. "Did I hear Miss. Greengrass correctly? You are on your way to the library? And to study no less?"Harry gave a tiny scowl. "I study. What's so strange about me going to the library?"Snape narrowed his eyes at the child. "Did I say it was strange Mr. Potter? And mind. Your. Tone." He said menacingly.Harry averted his eyes. "Sorry." He muttered."What was that? Speak up Mr. Potter and please show me the respect of looking me in the eye." Snape glared at him. Insolent brat, he thought. Or a child who expects nothing but ridicule from me, he amended to himself.Harry lifted his eyes to meet Snape's. "I'm sorry." He said more audibly.Snape nodded. "I did not mean to imply that you do not study Mr. Potter. I was merely pleased that you appear to be getting along with your housemates and are studying with them.""Oh." Harry said embarrassed that he had reacted the way he did. "Ron and Hermione are going to be there too. There's not, uh, any rules against spending time with people from different houses is there?""Of course not." Snape rolled his eyes. "You are not restricted from seeing your Gryffindor friends as long as you take the time to get to know your new housemates which you appear to be doing." He looked at Harry critically. "Were you able to eat all your lunch?""Not all of it but most of it. Why did the porridge appear in front of me like that?" Harry asked."I knew your stomach would need time to be able to handle regular food again. You will notice that at each meal food will appear to you that will be gentler on the stomach." Snape informed him. "And at your breakfast your nutrition potion will appear. I expect you to take it. If anyone asks about it who you do not want to know what it is simply tell them it for a vitamin deficiency which it is, partly."Harry nodded. "Thank you sir." He hesitated. "You're being nice!" He blurted out.Snape's eyes widened and he looked around. "I am not! And do not say that out loud Potter, I have a reputation to uphold."Harry bit his lip so he wouldn't laugh. "Sorry. I just meant you're being decent.""I am your Head of House and am just fulfilling my responsibility towards you." Snape said stiffly. He turned on the spot and stalked away, his robes billowing out behind him.Harry sighed. Responsibility. That would be the only reason an adult would act like they care about him. Still, it was more than the Dursley's had ever done for him. He continued on his way to the library, ready to spend some time with his friends.HPHPHPHPSnape went to his quarters and poured himself a half glass of brandy. He knew he shouldn't have reacted so unfeeling to Potter but he didn't know how to be anything else towards the boy. Even with his own students in his house he kept a slightly cold demeanor. With the students he helped who were like Potter he made sure he did what he could to help them but he was not a warm comforting person. However, as he was now Potter's guardian he would have to change that. Guardian to James Potter's son, he groaned to himself. Guardian to Lily's child, another voice in his head whispered.Snape lowered himself onto his sofa and slowly sipped his drink. He let himself get lost in thoughts of auburn hair and a gentle laugh, two kids talking of their hopes and dreams for the future. For her, he would try harder.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for the reviews and adds! =)Studying in the library did not end up well. It started out fine with Ron and Hermione working on transfiguration and Daphne helping Astoria with her potions essay. Harry was working on his own potions essay and when Draco and Theo and Tracey entered the library, they sat with them and began working on their homework too. Harry had been surprised when Draco actually helped him with his essay."Don't just say that the potion has to be green when brewed correctly, it has to be a bright green." Draco informed Harry after he had glanced at his essay. "If the Shrinking Solution is even the wrong shade it can be very poisonous."Harry gave him a bemused look and then changed the wording in his essay. "Thanks." He muttered, still not trusting that Malfoy would be helpful without an ulterior motive.Theo snickered. "I heard last year a student did the Shrinking Solution and it was a very dark green. He actually tried it before Professor Snape could stop him!"Tracey laughed. "What did he try it on?""His partner!" Theo laughed harder. "She shrunk to where she could fit in your pocket! Professor Snape apparently yelled at him for like fifteen minutes while he made the potion to restore her. He then took five hundred points and gave the guy detention for a month! He also had to write an eight foot essay on the dangers of the Shrinking Solution."Ron looked up, his eyes wide. "Whoa! I've never heard a punishment being given out that was so harsh! It must have been a Gryffindor" He rolled his eyes, clearly believing that Snape would only punish a Gryffindor like that.Theo narrowed his eyes at the red-head. "Actually, it was a Hufflepuff. A clearly foolish Hufflepuff who didn't catch on that potion making can be dangerous. His lab partner could have died or been stuck that size forever.""Oh." Ron looked back down at his homework."I can't believe a student would do that, it's so dangerous!" Hermione exclaimed. "He's lucky he wasn't expelled!""He probably would have rather been expelled. Can you imagine having to face Professor Snape in class every week after pulling that stunt?" Draco asked as he focused on his text.Hermione looked surprised that Draco had commented on something she said without insulting her. She exchanged a look with Ron and shrugged.Ron looked at Draco warily. "Why are you sitting with us? Ow Hermione!" He complained when she hit his arm."Don't be rude!" Hermione hissed.Draco snorted. "Interesting that it is the pure-blood that is rude and the mud- Ow!" Draco glared Daphne."Don't you dare say it." Daphne threatened."Why wouldn't he say it? He's a Slytherin and they look down on muggle-borns." Seamus said from behind them. Dean and Neville were with him. "They also look down at half-bloods. And people they consider blood-traitors.""They're evil so why are you sitting with them?" Dean frowned at Ron, Hermione and Harry."We are not evil!" Astoria protested, looking hurt."Quiet snake!" Dean glared at her.Harry stood up. "That's enough. What is with you? You do realize you are bullying a first year right?" His green eyes flashed angrily.Dean opened his mouth and then closed it, looking a little ashamed. "Sorry." He said looking at Astoria.Astoria smiled brightly. "It's okay."Draco sighed. "She's too forgiving. You really need to work on that." He said to Daphne.Daphne simply rolled her eyes and watched as her sister went back to doing her essay. Her little sister really did have the kindest of hearts. She looked at Harry. "Thank you. Again."Harry nodded and then looked at Dean and Seamus. "You guys are welcome to join us if you can be civil. I mean, if Malfoy can pretty much manage it then you should be able to as well.""Hey!"Harry ignored Draco and kept his stare on his friends. Neville had already settled in beside Hermione and was taking out his Herbololgy text.Dean and Seamus hesitated. "Well-""This is ridiculous! Snakes and lions cannot be friends! You are making Gryffindor look weak." Cormac McLaggen interjected as he stopped by the table. "Are you two real Gryffindors or not?" He demanded looking at Dean and Seamus."Of course we are!" Dean exclaimed. He glanced at Harry. "Sorry Harry. We'll talk to you when you are back in Gryffindor."Cormac snorted. "Please. Potter doesn't deserve to return to Gryffindor. If I was told I had to spend some time in Slytherin I would have gone straight home instead. If you were a true lion you would have. You want to be respected again Potter? Tell Dumbledore that you either return to Gryffindor now or go home." He gave Potter a disgusted look and left with Dean and Seamus following him.Harry stared after them and realized he was shaking by the mere suggestion that he go home. What if other people started wondering why he was so adamant that he not return to his relative's? What if they figured out-"Harry? What's wrong?" Hermione asked. "Don't let what McLaggen said upset you.""Yeah, he's a jerk anyway." Ron added, wondering why Harry seemed so upset.Harry looked briefly at his friends and then looked away. "I think I still have a touch of the flu. I'll see you guys later." He mumbled and then walked as fast as he could out of the library. He heard Daphne call after him but he didn't stop. He felt pathetic and wanted to hide.HPHPHPHPHarry went to the owlery and visited Hedwig. She hooted happily when she saw him and he spent an hour petting and talking to her. He had brought up some treats for her which he also shared with some of the other owls that were there. He knew it was dinnertime but he wasn't hungry and didn't feel like facing anyone. Looking out to the grounds he squinted when he saw a dog. At first he thought it was Hagrid's dog Fang but it looked smaller than Fang. He blinked and then the dog was gone and he wondered if he imagined it. He stayed up in the owlery for a little while longer, lost in thought. When he finally headed back down he heard whispering from the portraits as he walked. He stopped and looked at them curiously. "What?" He asked a portrait which contained an old fashioned looking Wizard holding a book."Your professors have been looking for you young man." The man sniffed. "You should hurry to your dorm.""Um, okay." Harry continued on to the Slytherin dungeons. He came to a stop when he saw the Bloody Baron, the Slytherin ghost. He had never talked to him before and had always been a little scared of the ghost covered in what looked like silver blood."There you are." The Bloody Baron said and his voice was low and raspy. "Your Head of House has been looking for you. Several of your housemates have been worried as well."Harry was confused. What was the big deal? "Okay. Um, thank you sir." He hurried and said the password quickly and entered the common room. Several students were there, including Pansy and Blaise and Millicent Bulstrode."He made it back in one piece. Too bad." Blaise snickered."Once again showing his need for everyone's attention." Pansy added.Harry ignored them and continued walking through the common room. He yelped in surprise when something barreled into him."Harry you're okay!" Astoria looked up at him and beamed. "We were worried!"Harry put an arm around her. "You were? Why?" He looked up and gulped a little when he saw Daphne, Theo and Draco coming towards him with glares on their faces."What's the problem?" He asked weakly as Astoria stepped back."Where in the world were you?" Daphne demanded and Harry noticed her eyes appeared a darker blue than normal. She's even pretty when she's angry, he thought absently."You know, we are aware that a murderer is after you." Draco frowned. He still couldn't believe that he had felt actual concern for Potter."Yeah and then you disappear for hours." Theo added."How did you know about Black being after me?" Harry asked curiously. Except for Ron and Hermione he didn't think any of the other students knew he may be the reason Sirius Black had escaped Azkaban.Draco sighed. "My father. He works in the ministry, you know, and was aware that they were taking precautions in case Black comes here looking for you.""Is that where you were? Escaping from Sirius Black?" Astoria asked eagerly.Harry laughed. "No. I was in the owlery.""This whole time?" Daphne looked exasperated. She shook her head. "I forgot that you had an owl.""We thought you were hiding in Gryffindor Tower." Theo said."Potter." Graham walked up to them, looking serious. "Professor Snape said as soon as you came back to go to his office. I would have a darn good excuse for being missing for several hours if I were you."Harry felt his stomach swoop at the thought of facing Snape. "Okay. Thanks.""Oh and Potter." Graham added before Harry left. "I want to talk to you about something when you get back. Assuming that you are still in one piece that is." He smirked.Seeing the looks of pity on everyone else's faces didn't help to calm Harry's nerves. When he got to Snape's office door he hesitated. He wasn't looking forward to facing Snape's wrath, that was for sure. Although he didn't see what the problem was.Harry tentatively knocked and winced at the sharp, "Come in!"As soon as Harry entered the Potion Master's office Snape flew at him and was looming over him with a severe look on his face. "Foolish and inconsiderate child! Where were you? How dare you take off and not even let one person know where you were going. Do you have any sense of responsibility boy?" Snape snapped, his voice filled with anger.Harry flinched at the anger and the word boy, stepping back and pressing himself against the wall. He stared at Snape with wide eyes, unable to say anything.Snape saw the fear in those green eyes and immediately backed away a few steps. He was angry and had no problem with Potter knowing that but he had not intended to strike actual fear into the boy. He had been worried when Potter had not shown up for dinner in the Great Hall and when he asked his Slytherins, no one knew where he had gone after the library. He had then questioned the Gryffindor table much to their displeasure. When no one had admitted to seeing Potter he had started alerting the professors, ghosts and portraits. He had started searching himself until a portrait informed him that Potter was on his way to the dungeons. He then told his Head Boy to tell Potter to come to his office. He had figured he would need a few moments to calm himself. Apparently he needed more time."Sit down." He said, struggling to keep from still yelling. Knowing of Potter's past, he knew he couldn't come across too aggressive. He would make sure the child was aware of the errors he had made tonight though. He was also curious as to why when he had said the word boy Potter had acted like a deer in headlights.Harry sat down, keeping his eyes on Snape warily until the Professor sat down behind his desk."Why were you not at dinner?" Snape asked as he gave his charge, not that Potter knew that yet, a hard stare."I wasn't hungry." Harry answered softly."I believe Madame Pomfrey and I told you that you needed to gain weight. Obviously that would mean you are not to skip meals. You will eat three meals a day Mr. Potter no excuses. I do not care if you are not hungry or not, you will still eat something." Snape said in a tone that meant business. "You are malnourished and will not be healthy until you get your weight up. Do you understand?"Harry bit his lip and nodded. He had never had anyone be angry because he skipped a meal before. Usually it was the opposite. "I understand sir."Snape nodded. "Where were you?" He asked again."The owlery. I got upset…um" Harry paused, not wanting to complain like a baby about the altercation in the library. "I wanted to be alone. I didn't think it would be a big deal.""You didn't think it would be a big deal." Snape repeated slowly. "I do not know how things are run in Gryffindor but in Slytherin not one of my students just takes off without telling someone where they are going first."Harry frowned. "It's not like I left the grounds or went somewhere forbidden." He pointed out with just a hint of defiance in his voice.Snape's dark eyes narrowed. "I would consider watching my attitude Mr. Potter. You are on thin ice as it is." He hissed."I don't get what I did wrong!" Harry protested. "I'm sorry I skipped dinner okay? I won't skip a meal again. But I was only in the owlery!"Snape gritted his teeth. The child was simply infuriating! How did he not understand what he had done wrong? Of course, what experience had Potter really had with being accountable to an adult? Snape knew that Minerva cared about her lions but with her deputy headmistress duties as well as teaching, she didn't seem to have many rules for her Gryffindors or keep tabs on them as well as she should. After all, Potter had almost gotten himself killed the past two years. He wandered around the castle anytime he wished. Yes, Minerva may care but she tended to turn a blind eye towards misbehavior and irresponsibility. He remembered that from his days as a student.Of course Snape knew he was at fault as well. Potter did not know about the guardianship or about Black. He also hadn't properly gone over the rules of the Slytherin House as he had been distracted with finding out about Potter's abuse."I'm sure you heard about the escaped murderer Sirius Black?" Snape asked calmly. "He is of course the reason the Dementors are surrounding the school. The reason the ministry believes he may come here is-""I know." Harry said flatly."Excuse me?" Snape asked, irritated at being interrupted.Harry sighed. "I know Sirius Black may be after me."Snape raised an eyebrow. "How do you know that?""Mr. Weasley told me before I boarded the train." Harry admitted. "He said Sirius was a follower of Vold-um, you-know-who and that I may be a target.""Did he say anything else?" Snape asked, mentally cursing Arthur Weasley. Who did that man think he was to tell Potter anything? And obviously Potter hadn't taken the possible threat seriously."No." Harry shrugged. "What else is there? Besides, why would Black escape prison and risk his freedom to simply come after me?"Snape rubbed a hand over his face. "He-who-shall-not-be-named," Here he gave a pointed glare at Harry. "had many followers. There are some who took his downfall personally and blame you. They would want revenge.""Wouldn't all his followers want revenge? Why only some?" Harry asked curiously."There are those who ended up regretting getting involved with you-know-who. The group he had formed was not what many expected it to be. In fact, most were happy when he disappeared." Snape took a deep breath. "That is not the point right now. The point is there is a good chance he is after you, after being in Azkaban for twelve years he would be even more deranged then he was before. That is why I insist on knowing where you are. If you want to visit the owlery within curfew hours that is fine, but you must let someone know. Preferably a prefect, the head boy or girl, or me. Am I clear on this? You will not leave this castle except for your Care of Magical Creatures class or to attend Quidditch games."Harry couldn't help feeling depressed. It sounded like last year when students had to be escorted everywhere only this time it was only him that had to be watched. He said so to the Professor."I'm sorry that it is such a bother to have people looking out for you." Snape couldn't help but sneer."I didn't mean that!" Harry denied. He wasn't trying to sound like an ungrateful brat but of course what else would Snape see him as? Snape hated him.Snape tried to reign in his temper. "You will follow my rules or else I will restrict you to your common room and dorms only, save for meals."Harry looked away and nodded. "Yes sir."Snape was silent for a moment. "What upset you in the library?" He asked suddenly."Oh, um…" Harry sighed. "Some kids were saying things that upset me.""What things?" Snape asked."Stuff about me being in Slytherin. That I should have gone home instead." Harry mumbled. "I got anxious I guess that they would start to wonder why I didn't want to go home and figure out..." He trailed off and shrugged."I see." Snape said slowly. Potter would be afraid of everyone finding out about the abuse as well as have an underlying fear of being sent back to his relative's. "You remember I said you would not be living with your relative's anymore correct?""Yes." Harry answered, looking up at his professor. "I haven't heard anymore about that though. Dumbledore might still insist that I go back. For the wards, especially if Black isn't caught by summer.""Professor Dumbledore," Snape stressed, eyeing Harry in disapproval. "is in agreement that you will not be returning to your relative's. Arrangements are being made for a new guardianship for you.""Who?" Harry asked, his eyes wide. He really wasn't being made to go back?"Does it matter as long as it isn't the Dursley's?" Snape asked curiously.Harry shrugged. "Not really. Even Filch would probably be better than them. Maybe."Snape looked amused and decided to test the waters. "Would I even be better than them?""Well yeah, I mean, you hate me too but you wouldn't starve or-"Harry stopped. He stared at Snape. "You?""I do not hate you." Snape said stiffly. He may have thought he did but now was realizing he didn't even know the boy. He hated his father and that Potter could remind him of James but mostly he hated that the child represented everything Snape had lost. And Snape knew it was his own fault for being so foolish in his youth."You don't?" Harry's mouth dropped open. If that was true then Harry would hate to see who Snape really did hate."No. You infuriate me but most children do." Snape hesitated. "You need a guardian who will protect you no matter what as well as make sure you are properly cared for and trained to defend yourself…" He took a deep breath. "I can do that for you. The Headmaster knows he can trust me to protect you.""So, I mean, you're willing to?" Harry was shocked. Snape as his guardian? Well, no one would want to mess with him if he had a fearsome guardian like Snape, he supposed."Yes." Snape answered. "I will need to go and have your relative's sign over guardianship but I certainly do not mind doing that." His eyes gleamed dangerously.Harry would have felt bad for the Dursley's if he didn't hate them so much. "They'll be mean to you. They won't even fake politeness, they hate magic." He thought he should warn Snape.Snape raised an eyebrow. The boy was warning him as if worried Snape would get his feelings hurt by the muggles. "I do believe I can handle them." Was all he said in response. "As you are to be my ward we will need to go over a few things but we can do that at a later time once the guardianship is official. The only point I would like to discuss now is that no, I would not starve you or hit you." He met Potter's eyes. "I have a temper yes, but I have never hit a child. I believe I scared you earlier when you arrived here but I would not have hurt you. I was worried and it came out in anger.""I didn't mean to flinch away as if you would hit me." Harry said, his face turning red. "It's just when you called me boy, it reminded me of my Aunt and Uncle. I was either boy or freak."Snape wanted to kick himself. His own father had called him the same, had rarely every used his actual name. "I did not mean to remind you of them. I will strive to not call you that again. As you know, I do have a temper and say things without thinking at times. I will work on it but don't expect it to change overnight. I've never been a guardian before so I will be learning as I go." He waved his wand over his desk and a bowl of chicken broth and a sandwich appeared along with a glass of milk. "You did not eat dinner so you will eat now while I grade papers and then you may return to the common room. If you intend to play Quidditch this year, you will need to gain weight to do so."Harry picked up the sandwich. "I can't play this term anyway." He said with a hint of sadness in his voice."Why not?" Snape asked as he kept his eyes on the papers he was grading. "I believe Mr. Montague may want to speak with you about that actually.""I can't play against Gryffindor." Harry said after he had swallowed his bite of sandwich.Snape rolled his eyes. "I figured as much. I talked a solution over with Mr. Montague and Mr. Malfoy. The decision is purely yours. Do not be pressured into anything and don't worry about offending anyone. As the Headmaster has pointed out many times, Quidditch was supposed to be a friendly rivalry." Though I still want my house to win, Snape thought with a smirk."I'll talk it over with them." Harry said as he finished his food. "Thank you for dinner. And I'm sorry for disappearing like that; I really didn't mean to cause any trouble.""I know." Snape admitted. "We can finish talking at a later time. It is getting close to curfew."Harry stood up and turned to go. He paused. "About the guardianship, I'm surprised but grateful not to have to go back to the Dursley's. I'll um, try not to infuriate you too much." He gave a cheeky grin.Snape snorted. "We'll see. As I said, we will talk more after the guardianship is official. Good night Mr. Potter.""Goodnight sir." Harry offered a smile and then left the office.TBC:A/N: Pretty please review if you get the chance!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for your support of my story! =) You guys rock!Harry re-entered the common room and made his way to where Daphne, Theo, Draco, Tracey and Graham were sitting by the fire talking.Daphne was the first to notice him. "Well, you don't look any worse for wear." She commented as Harry took a seat next to her."It wasn't so bad actually." Harry said thinking of how Snape was willing to be his new guardian so that he didn't have to go back to the Dursley's."Did you get into trouble?" Draco asked curiously."No." Harry answered with a chuckle. "I just got lectured on letting someone know where I am going and that I am not to leave the castle except for Care of Magical Creatures class and Quidditch games.""Speaking of Quidditch, what would you say to playing seeker on our team?" Graham asked eagerly.Harry hesitated and looked at Draco, expecting him to protest. Draco just was looking at him expectantly."I can't play against Gryffindor." Harry said finally."So predictable. We already realized that." Draco said as he rolled his eyes. "I would play seeker when we play Gryffindor. I will play chaser for the other games.""You already play against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw so it shouldn't matter which house you play seeker for." Graham reasoned."It does seem silly to not play for a whole term. Why should you give up something you enjoy?" Daphne said quietly. With Harry's abuse and being resorted, he should at least still get to play Quidditch.Harry thought for a minute. He really did miss playing and would love to be up in the air again. And Graham was right; he did play against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw already so what would it matter for him to play against them as part of the Slytherin team? He wouldn't play at all against Gryffindor so they wouldn't be mad right? He really would love to play…"I guess that would be fine. Brilliant actually, I do miss flying." Harry said, his eyes lighting up at the thought of being in the air again."You live with muggles right? So you haven't flown since before summer?" Graham stood up and began pacing slightly. "You need to join our practices as soon as possible. Professor Snape said you lost weight because of your flu so you need to gain it back. We all have to keep healthy in order to play which means healthy weight, plenty of sleep as well as keeping our grades up." Graham stopped pacing and looked at Harry. "Failure to meet any of those requirements means you can't play. Not just you, those rules apply to all of us.""Sounds fair." Harry said, wondering if McGonagall had those same rules and he had just not heard of them."Great!" Graham began to look excited. "Our team will be amazing! I'll let you know the practice schedule tomorrow!" He walked away, muttering ideas to himself of new line ups.Draco, Theo and Tracey drifted up to their dorms a few minutes later and it was just Daphne and Harry in the common room. "So, how are you doing?" Daphne asked a little hesitantly. "I mean, really doing?""I'm okay. I guess. I mean, I feel good. It's nice not to have injuries." Harry smiled ruefully.Daphne gave him a sad look. "Have you talked to anyone about your relative's? Like Ron and Hermione?"Harry shook his head. "No. I don't need to talk about it. I've spoken a little with Professor Snape and my friends don't need to know.""You mean your other friends." Daphne corrected him with a little smile. "We're your friends too now."Harry didn't say anything. He was still wary of everyone, especially Malfoy and Nott who had shown him in the past how much they hated him. Daphne had been nice from the start, Tracey and Graham as well.Daphne sighed. "I guess you need longer to realize that." She shook her head. "I still think you should tell Ron and Hermione. You'll probably feel better if you do."Harry disagreed. He would just feel more weak and ashamed than he already did. Besides, enough people knew about it already.HPHPHPHP"Ten points to whoever can first answer my questions. Just shout out the answer." Professor Sinistra said to her third year astronomy class. "What is a Nova?"Thanks to all the time spent in the library, Harry had been keeping up with most of his homework better than usual and automatically called out the answer. "A star that shows a sudden increase in brightness and then slowly returns to its original state over a few months.""Good job Harry!" Hermione whispered from a few seats down."When did you get here?" Ron said in surprise when he saw she was sitting next to him. Hermione ignored him."Well, very good Mr. Potter te-five points to Slytherin." Professor Sinistra said primly as she prepared to call out another question.Harry frowned. "I thought it was ten points for the correct answer."Professor Sinistra waved her hand dismissively. "I changed my mind. You gained points for your house, be happy about that.""But that isn't fair, you said-" Harry started to protest."Fine, ten points from Slytherin for arguing with a teacher." Professor Sinistra smirked and went back to asking questions to the class.Harry gaped at her. How unfair was that? "I never truly realized how prejudiced professors were against Slytherin before." Harry muttered, ignoring Daphne shaking her head."This is just how it is," Daphne hissed."What did you say Mr. Potter?" Professor Sinistra said with a glare.How could I have not ever seen this before? Harry thought he stared at Sinistra. "I believe you heard me Professor. If I was still in Gryffindor you would have awarded me the ten points I earned."Professor Sinistra stared at him and her face darkened. "You may leave my class Mr. Potter and I will be talking to Professor Snape about this, I assure you!"Harry rolled his eyes and got up to leave. Why had he never realized how blatant the treatment was against Slytherins? To not award him the points he earned just because of the house he was in? "Perhaps I will be talking to the Headmaster about the way you treat students from certain Houses. He might be interested." He stared at her defiantly for a moment and then left the classroom, the rest of the students staring after him in shock.He paused halfway down the hall. Snape was in class and he wondered how bad of a lecture he would get. Maybe he should make good on his threat to talk to the Headmaster. He thought about visiting the owlery again but then remembered that he was supposed to let someone know where he was so he figured it would just be better to go to the common room.There were a few older students studying and Harry gave them a nod as he sat in the corner of the room."Hey Harry, why aren't you in class?" Graham asked as he walked by with a pile of books in his arms."Um, I was asked to leave." Harry admitted.Graham frowned. "Why?"Harry told him what happened and Graham chuckled. "Ah yes. Professor Sinistra is not a fan of ours. There really is nothing you can do about it. It's best just to not react.""But it's not fair!" Harry retorted. How could they not react to it?Head girl and also Graham's girlfriend Megan Rowstock had overheard and laughed. "A lot of things are not fair." Megan said gently. "So many assume we are horrible people just because we are in Slytherin. And it seems the only bad witches and wizards people focus on are the ones from Slytherin. Of course, You-Know-Who didn't help the situation but there are dark wizards from other houses yet they don't get labeled like we do."Harry nodded. Sirius Black came to mind. He was also finding he was starting to be able to tell those in Slytherin that supported Voldemort from those who didn't."I wish I had realized the outright unfairness earlier. I feel bad that I didn't." Harry said regretfully. "I was thinking of talking to Dumbledore about it." He added.Graham and Megan exchanged a look. "We like the Headmaster; he's a good man and a very powerful wizard." Graham said slowly. "But sometimes it appears that he is like the rest. Remember your first year when Gryffindor won the house cup? It wasn't that you won that bothered us, well, most of us. It was the way it was announced.""Everyone was so excited to think we had won. The Great Hall was decorated in our colors and everything." Megan added. "Then Professor Dumbledore added more points and suddenly the Gryffindors won. It was embarrassing to have it happen like that and the younger years especially were so disappointed. If the Headmaster had awarded the points beforehand it would have been better. To make a house think they won and then take it away in front of the whole school made us feel like we didn't matter."Harry stayed quiet as he remembered that day. He had been so excited that Gryffindor had won, especially since he had lost them so many points during the year. He hadn't really thought about how the Slytherin students would feel. "I'm sorry." He offered.Graham and Megan looked surprised "it wasn't your fault, although some of students blamed you." Graham said ruefully. "But it's just the way things are.""It shouldn't be. It can change." Harry argued, though he wondered how it could. He was being treated differently for being temporarily in Slytherin. The houses really shouldn't be so divided. They all had good things about them. He was seeing that now.The door burst open and students began coming in talking and laughing."Potter that was brilliant!" Theo said enthusiastically. "Professor Sinistra was really thrown by what you said. She barely lectured, just had us read.""I have to hand it to you, sticking up for Slytherin like that was pretty cool." Draco admitted.Daphne beamed at him. "No one has ever done that to a professor before! We've all wanted to!" She grinned."It makes losing ten points worth it!" Tracey added.Harry grimaced "I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean for that to happen. I just got mad." He explained."Sure you didn't Potter." Pansy said as she and Blaise passed by. "We know that you are acting like you are sticking up for Slytherin yet still trying getting points taken away.""He's not clever enough to pull that off Parkinson." Draco rolled his eyes.Harry snorted. "Gee thanks." He told him."It would be a very Slytherin move though." Daphne teased him."I'll earn the points back." Harry promised. And he meant it.HPHPHPHP"So I got a visit from Professor Sinistra today." Snape said leaning back in his chair and regarding Harry thoughtfully. He had thought it was crazy to have a Potter in Slytherin but a Potter sticking up for Slytherin? He never would have believed it. It definitely wasn't a James characteristic but it was Lily one. She would often remark about the unfairness she would see among the houses.Harry looked at him nervously. He had known as soon as he had gotten summoned after dinner what this conversation would be about. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude to her. I just lost my temper.""Because she took points? She usually does from my Slytherins." Snape said. "Of course I have taken points if a student gets a question wrong so I can't really complain."Harry looked confused. "I didn't get a question wrong. She said she would award ten points to the first student to answer the question she called out and I did. Then she awarded Slytherin five points only and I, um, got a little upset." Harry confessed. "I said she was prejudiced and she took ten points from me." Harry braced himself for an insult or lecture.Snape's face darkened. And there it was. The flagrant unfairness with which his students were treated. If it had been any other house they would have received the full ten points. He noticed the way Potter was holding himself and tried to relax his features. "I am not angry at you Mr. Potter. Yes, you shouldn't be disrespectful to a Professor but I can see why you would be upset. I am, however, quite angry that Professor Sinistra lied to me.' His eyes narrowed. "Unfortunately there is not much you can do in these situations except tell me when they occur and let me deal with it.""I'm sorry. I'm not trying to lose Slytherin points, honest." Harry said hoping Snape believed him.Snape raised an eyebrow. "I did not think you were. If some of your peers are accusing you of that I can talk to them.""No that's okay." Harry assured him. He didn't want to seem like a tattletale or something. "My friends thought it was brilliant actually." He grinned a little."Ah Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley? Snape asked with a nod."No, my friends here in Slytherin." Harry responded, surprising himself. Huh. He really did feel like he had friends here. Who would have ever thought?Snape felt a little surprised to hear that but was satisfied. He never would have thought it possible but was quite pleased that his future ward was fitting into Slytherin. "I am gratified to hear that you are making friends here." He admitted."Me too." Harry gave a brief chuckle. "I thought I would be alone and hated and after this past summer especially…" He trailed off. "Sorry I didn't mean to bring that up.""Your relatives? On the contrary I would like to speak of them more. You need to talk about it Harry." Snape said, his tone as gentle as Harry had ever heard it.Harry's eyes widened. "You called me Harry?"Snape rolled his eyes. "Is that not your name?" Merlin, when had the child become Harry? Snape sighed. However if he was to be Pott - Harry's guardian he should start getting used to calling him Harry. Except for in class of course. Or except for when he was frustrated with the child which would most likely be quite often.Harry smiled slowly. "Yes it is." His smile faded. "I hate thinking about the Dursley's let alone talking about them. They hated me and they hurt me, the end.""No it is not the end." Snape shook his head. "You will never be able to truly move on until you talk about what you went through. I know of what I speak Harry."Harry was quiet. Did that mean…He didn't know if he should ask though. "I didn't understand why they hated me so much." He said slowly. "When I was little I didn't understand why I did all the chores and was told it wasn't good enough or why I would make the meals and most of the time was not allowed to eat any of it. Or why I had to sleep in a cupboard when Dudley had two bedrooms…""Excuse me?" Snape burst out. A cupboard? Lily's son slept in a cupboard?"What?" Harry asked."You slept in a cupboard?" Snape said, struggling to keep his anger under control.Harry nodded, a red flush heating his face. "Yeah, the cupboard under the stairs. My Hogwarts letter was even addressed to it. It was my bedroom until I was about to start school here. I would get locked in when I did freaky things or didn't finish the chores in time."Merlin I need a calming draught, Snape thought as he rubbed his temples. Here he had deluded himself into thinking the child had been coddled and treated like royalty and the boy had been living in a cupboard. "You didn't do freaky things, you did accidental magic. Your relative's knew that and chose to treat cruelly because they are afraid of magic. Or jealous perhaps." He added that as he thought of how Petunia had acted towards Lily as a child. "And locking a child in a cupboard, never mind having that be your room, is despicable.""I know." Harry said with a sigh. "I didn't then, but I know that now."Snape nodded. "You are also aware that you did not deserve any of their horrible treatment?"Harry nodded after a moment.Snape regarded him for a moment. Harry sounded a bit unsure and that would have to be dealt with. The first thing he had to accept was that nothing he could do would warrant that type of treatment. And nothing he had done had warranted my treatment of him, he thought with guilt. Lily would have his head if she was here."Should I apologize to Professor Sinistra?" Harry asked, obviously not wanting to talk about the Dursley's anymore.Snape decided not to press for more information. Harry had opened up a little more and that was enough for today. It would take time but eventually he would be able to talk about everything and accept that he was not to blame. Snape would make sure of it."Yes, apologize when you see her again. Even though she was in the wrong you still need to be respectful to your professors, even when they don't deserve it. Remember, if a professor treats you unfairly like that you tell me and let me deal with it. Didn't you go to Professor McGonagall when I was unfair to you?" Snape asked."No." Harry answered."You didn't?" Snape asked disbelievingly. He had assumed Potter would have complained about the detentions and loss of points. Of course, seeing as how Potter didn't talk tell about his abuse it made sense if he didn't. He had been taught not to complain or tell the truth because in his mind no would care or listen.Harry shrugged. "No I didn't see the point. Other students probably have though." He grinned.Snape gave a smirk. "No doubt. Now, can I trust that you will come to me if something like this happens again?"Harry's first response was to say he could handle himself but he stopped himself. Snape was actually trying to be helpful and he was almost his guardian now. Harry couldn't say he trusted him, not yet at least, not fully but he seemed sincere in wanting to help him. "It's not my first instinct but I will try to." He said instead.Snape nodded. "Thank you." He replied. He knew Harry's trust in adults, especially him, would come with time. He felt progress was being made in that direction however and was fairly content in how things were going. He was doing it for Lily and truth be told, he was also doing it for Harry. The boy was very much different than what he had thought him to be and Harry deserved a better childhood than what he had been given. Snape just hoped he could help make up for it.TBC: Please review if you get the chance!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: A little angst for Harry involving two friends but he won't be upset for long =)Harry was heading outside for his first Quidditch practice when he ran into Ron and Hermione. "Hey Harry! Where are you going? The library's that way." Ron said."Oh sorry guys, I won't be able to study with you." Harry said, feeling bad that he had forgotten to tell them he wouldn't be able to study with them today.Ron frowned. "Why do you have your Quidditch gear with you?""Um, I have practice." Harry said a little nervously."You have practice." Ron repeated."Oh, you're playing with the Slytherins? That's good Harry; you deserve to have some fun." Hermione said approvingly."Are you completely mental?" Ron practically shouted. "It's one thing to befriend some of them. I mean, you do have to live with them but to play Quidditch with them? To play against Gryffindor?""I'm not-" Harry tried to tell Ron he wouldn't be playing against Gryffindor but Ron wouldn't give him the chance."Are you turning your back on your true house? Have you been corrupted already?" Ron practically snarled."Ronald!" Hermione said disapprovingly.Ron rolled his eyes. "It's like something is wrong with both of my best friends. Hermione, you can't see that your cat is trying to kill Scabbers and Harry is turning into an actual snake!""Crookshanks is doing no such thing and Harry is making the best of a difficult situation!" Hermione retorted."Wait-"Harry started."He spends more time with them than with us and you know it! Hermione, you even mentioned how you wondered if we were being replaced." Ron glared at Harry.Harry's eyes widened. "I'm not replacing you! I'm just making more friends. You've studied with them in the library, you know they are nice.""We know they are acting nice." Ron corrected him. "We don't know if their intentions are good. They could be setting you up for something!""They're not!" Harry exclaimed. "Trust me if they were out to get me then they would have told everyone about-"He stopped. He had almost blurted out about his abuse. He knew it was irrational but he just couldn't tell them."About what?" Hermione pressed."Nothing." Harry shook his head. "Not everyone in Slytherin is nice to me but many of them are." He noticed the hurt expression on Hermione's face and frowned. "What's wrong?'"There is something going on with you and they know about it. Why can you tell them and not us?" Hermione asked sadly."I-there's nothing going on Hermione." Harry said, shaking his head. "Everything's fine.""Nothing's fine! You're becoming a true Slytherin and apparently you are hiding something from us!" Ron exploded. "I can't believe you're going to play against Gryffindor!""I'm not you prat!" Harry yelled back. "I will play seeker against the other two houses but I won't play at all against Gryffindor!""So? You're still playing them as a Slytherin!" Ron huffed."I am a Slytherin right now! And why should I give up playing Quidditch? I play against Hufflefpuff and Ravenclaw anyway." Harry threw his hands up."It's Quidditch! The Slytherins are the enemies." Ron insisted.Harry took a step back. "Well, I guess that means I'm the enemy too." He looked at Hermione who still looked upset. "And I'm sorry but if something is going on with me, it's my right to tell someone when I am ready." Harry sighed. "I don't want to lose you two. But even when I am back in Gryffindor, I am still going to be friends with Daphne, Theo, Tracey and even Draco.""He's Draco now!" Ron exploded again, looking to Hermione in exasperation.Harry gritted his teeth and turned to leave. He was already late for his first practice with the team and nothing was going to be resolved with tempers running so high. He walked away without another word.HPHPHPHP"Geez Harry, you're flying as if a dragon is chasing you!" Graham laughed as he signaled for the team to land."Calm down a bit won't you?" Draco added as he smoothly landed next to Harry. "You almost took a bunch of out! Which is fine when playing the other houses."Harry ran a hand through his hair. "Sorry. I guess I'm a little upset and it showed up in my flying." Actually, more than a little upset Harry thought ruefully.Graham shrugged and grinned. "Either way great game everyone! We are definitely ready for our match against Hufflepuff. And Harry, seriously you are amazing on a broom. A true natural no doubt about it.""Thanks." Harry smiled a bit. It had felt great to be back up in the sky."It's obvious to anyone with a brain that whatever made you late is what you're upset about. So what happened?" Draco asked as they began walking back to the castle."It was nothing." Harry muttered, thinking of how Ron had made him feel guilty for making new friends and playing Quidditch with them. And then there was Hermione who was upset because she knows that he is hiding something. It's my right to tell or not tell, Harry thought stubbornly. That decision had been taken from him before when Snape had removed the glamour.Theo and Draco glanced at each other. "It's not nothing, but you can tell us when you are ready." Draco said finally."Unless someone threatened you or something." Theo said with a questioning look at Harry. "Because if that is the case-""No, no one threatened me." Harry shook his head. He hesitated. "It's just Ron and Hermione are mad at me right now."Draco rolled his eyes, not seeing Astoria and Tabitha coming up behind him. "Who cares what the weasel and mudblood think." Draco said. His silver eyes widened when Harry's face turned red with anger and he took a step towards Draco. Theo punched him in the arm. Hard. "Ow!""How could you say that!" Astoria cried and the three teenagers saw Astoria and Tabitha standing behind Draco. Tabitha looked like she was going to cry and ran off down the hallway.Astoria glared at Draco. "You're awful! How could you say that bad word! Tabitha is a muggle-born!"Draco looked in the direction the little girl had run off and sighed. "It just slipped out. My Dad uses it and-""It's wrong and you know it." Astoria's eyes filled with tears. "I thought you were nice." She looked sadly at Draco and then took off after her friend.Draco saw Theo and Harry glaring at him. "It just slipped out okay?""Like it slipped out last year?" Harry asked angrily."I was raised with referring to muggle-borns as being mud- that word." Draco tried to defend himself. He knew it was pointless though. Professor Snape would have his head on a platter when he found out. He had been lucky last year that his Head of House never heard about it but this time he didn't think that would be the case."Yeah, your dad is a great role model." Harry said sarcastically, thinking of how Lucius had treated Dobby and tried to get rid of Dumbledore.Draco's temper rose. "What do you know of having a dad? And hey, at least I don't get hit!"Silence. Theo looked furious and Draco looked shocked, as if he couldn't believe what he had said.Harry felt numb. This was what he had expected when the truth about his abuse was discovered. This was the Malfoy he knew and hated."I-I didn't mean that." Draco stammered."Sure you did." Harry said flatly. He walked away, his heart beginning to pound and he felt shaky. He decided to go to the one place that always calmed him. The owleryHPHPHPHPSnape found him there an hour later. Harry was sitting on a bench and was petting Hedwig who was perched on his shoulder. He looked up when he heard someone enter. "Sorry, I forgot to tell someone I was here."Snape regarded him silently for a moment. "That is not my concern at the moment." He said finally. "At least I know where to check for you before I start to worry. I heard what happened and wanted to check on you.""I'm fine." Harry said dully. He looked up and saw the disapproving look on Snape's face. "Okay, I'm upset.""And you have every right to be." Snape said as he stood in front of Harry and leaned back on the balcony. "What Mr. Malfoy said to you was deplorable. Quite unforgivable actually."Harry shrugged. "How he acted is exactly how I would expect him to act. I knew he was appearing too nice. Well, sort of nice.""Mr. Malfoy, though he likes to act otherwise, is not as terrible of a person as you are likely thinking right now." Snape said slowly. "He-""Of course you are taking his side! Unbelievable! The bullies get away with everything!" Harry stood up and glared at Snape."Be quiet!" Snape glowered. "And do not interrupt me! Sit down, I was not finished." He took a deep breath. "I do not condone what Mr. Malfoy said to you or the word he used regarding muggle-borns. In fact, I am quite disgusted with his behavior. Unfortunately, Mr. Malfoy was raised to believe he had to act a certain way. I believe it is a mask he wears and why he tries to act so superior. However, it certainly does not excuse his behavior and I assure you I will not be lenient with him.""It doesn't matter." Harry said as he stood up again. Hedwig flew back to her perch. "It's just words.""Words can hurt very much." Snape said and was briefly reminded of the look on Lily's face when he had flung mudblood at her. "And it does matter. As I said, you have every right to be angry.""You should talk to Tabitha." Harry said suddenly. "She heard Draco say that word and Astoria said she is a muggle-born.""Yes I know she is. I will be talking with her." Snape said, once again reminded of how he had underestimated the child. Potter had had something cruelly said to him and was worried about the feelings of a first year. "I would like you to return to your dorm, it is getting late."Harry nodded and followed his Professor back to the Slytherin dungeons. Once they entered Harry saw Daphne and Astoria comforting Tabitha whose eyes were red from crying. He saw Theo and Tracey quietly talking to each other and Draco sitting alone on the sofa. Draco looked up and Harry was surprised to see clear regret in his eyes."Mr. Malfoy, wait for me in my office." Snape said and his voice was like ice.Draco got up and walked past them. He paused by Harry. "I'm sorry." He whispered. He continued out of the room."Tabitha, may I speak with you for a moment?" Snape asked in a gentle voice. He guided Tabitha over to the corner of the room and began softly speaking with her.Harry went over to Daphne and Astoria, Theo and Tracy joining them. "Are you all right?" Daphne asked Harry."Sure, I'm okay." Harry answered, looking over to where Snape was still talking to Tabitha. She was nodding to whatever he was saying and looked a bit happier."I can't believe Draco!" Tracey said. "We put up with his attitude way too much.""He's mean!" Astoria said, looking very sad."Oh Tori." Daphne said as she put her arm around her little sister. "Sometimes people say cruel things in the heat of the moment. But you are correct, what Draco said was very mean and he should not have said it.""I hate Draco and I am never going to speak to him again!" Astoria said, crossing her arms.Harry couldn't help but smile at the childish scowl on her face. He caught Daphne fighting a smile as well.Tabitha came back over looking much happier than earlier."Tabby, are you feeling better?" Astoria asked her friend worriedly.Tabitha nodded. "Yes. Professor Snape said he can tell already that I am a bright witch and that being a muggle-born or not doesn't make you better or smarter and doesn't impact on how gifted a witch or wizard is." She smiled happily. "He said Draco was just being a dunderhead!" She and Astoria broke into giggles.Harry laughed with everyone else. He was impressed with what Snape had said to Tabitha. Before this term he had been sure that Snape cared about pure- blood status. He had also assumed that all Slytherins were pure-bloods. Now he knew that there were half-bloods and muggle-borns here as well. There were so many of his perceptions on Slytherins and Snape that were being changed.After Astoria and Tabitha left, Theo turned to Harry. "Draco bringing up your abuse was completely out of line. I thought he was getting better with his superior attitude but I guess I was wrong." He sighed. "He's going to end up just like his father."Tracey shivered. "His dad is scary. I wouldn't want to get on his bad side."Harry smirked to himself, remembering that he was already on Lucius Malfoy's bad side after tricking him into freeing Dobby. Suddenly he frowned. "You don't think that Mr. Malfoy hurts Draco do you?"Theo shook his head. "No, I don't think so. From what Draco has told me, Mr. Malfoy will make him feel shamed if he thinks Draco isn't honoring the Malfoy name. I think he is cold to Draco and makes Draco feel like he is always disappointed in him but I don't believe he hurts Draco physically. I've been to the Malfoy Manor and Mr. Malfoy is strict and distant with him. Mrs. Malfoy is nice though.""So Draco is trying to act like his father would want him to." Daphne said slowly. "He's still wrong to say the things he says."Harry nodded but found himself feeling a bit of pity for Draco. He also wondered who the real Draco was. The boy who acted like everyone was inferior to him or the boy who showed concern for Harry and kept his secret?HPHPHPHPThe door shut behind Draco as he left the office and Snape gave a deep sigh. Had he gotten through to the boy? He hoped so. He would hate for Draco, or any of his Slytherins, to go down the same path Snape had. He also strongly suspected that Lucius didn't want that either. Now that he knew he wouldn't have to pretend to still be a death eater he could be more direct in his approach against warning students from following that path. He had told Draco that he needed to be true to himself and not be what he thought his father wanted him to be. He had also told Draco that despite what some people thought, being a Slytherin did not mean being a bully and it was a dishonor to the house of Slytherin for him to act as such."By trying to be what you think your father wants you to be you risk losing your friends. Is that what you want? You show weakness when you act as you did today Draco. You show cowardice. Truth be told, I expect better from you!" Snape had said sternly."I didn't mean to say it! It just slipped out." Draco had defended himself. "I didn't mean it at all.""Your actions show otherwise." Snape had said coldly. "I will not tolerate it. I have enough Slytherins that act like spoiled children that I have to deal with. I had hoped it would be different with you! I had hoped you would grow out of it by now Draco!" He knew he was being harsh but he needed to be. He had sent Draco back to his dorm with orders to apologize to Harry and Tabitha as well as a lengthy essay to write and seven hundred lines, both to be completed in two days. He had known Draco as a small child and knew there was a good kid in there. Unfortunately, since Lucius kept himself so distant from his son, Draco was interpreting that as Lucius being disappointed in him. But it was a façade; Lucius like to keep himself distant as he thought it made him seem more powerful. It was not because he wanted to keep acting like a Death Eater.Oh, Lucius like to act like the part. He enjoyed having people fear him but what Lucius valued was power. Lucius had that now in the ministry and Snape was fairly sure that the last thing Lucius would want was the Dark Lord returning. Many Death Eaters were relieved when the Dark Lord vanished and was presumed dead. Not many enjoyed being tortured on a regular basis simply because their Master was bored. And many including Lucius hated having to grovel at his feet and be treated as a common house-elf.Snape had hated it too. Of course, he had realized his mistake not long after he had joined the Death Eaters. But once you were in, you were in. He had tried to convince himself that he wanted to stay and that he would have revenge on those who had hurt him in the past and would finally be respected. Instead he was forced to watch and participate in horrible acts that still haunted him to this day. However, the main regret was the prophecy. Because of him Lily was gone. He had not even thought that the prophecy was real as he had never taken divination seriously; he had just wanted to appear to be a good servant to the Dark Lord by giving any information even if it was something as ridiculous as a prophecy from Sybill Trelawney. Once he had realized that the prophecy was being taken seriously and that Lily's son had been targeted, he had tried to save her by going to Dumbledore begging him to protect her and her family. He had become a spy for Dumbledore to try and make up for all his mistakes as well as because he didn't want the Dark Lord to succeed. When he had vanished Snape had hoped it would be forever. However, Harry's first year showed that wasn't the case and the Headmaster was convinced the Dark Lord would return someday. Snape had already prepared himself for the fact that when that happened he would return to his duties as a Death Eater so that Dumbledore would have an advantage. Now however, Snape was doing something much more frightening. He was going to become a guardian to a teenager.TBC: Review if you get the chance! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for the reviews! I hope you like this chapter!A/N: If any of you read my Always series, the first chapter of the third story is now up! =)"Welcome to your third year of Defense against the Dark Arts. I am Professor Lupin." Remus smiled at the class. "I understand that last year you did not learn much defense from your, um, professor."Snickers greeted that statement as they were all reminded of Lockhart's incompetence. "Lockhart was such a dolt." Someone muttered and they laughed again.Remus fought a smile. "Yes well, moving on. We will be studying boggarts today. Does anyone know what a boggart is?" He nodded to the student raising her hand. "Yes Miss…""Granger. Hermione Granger." Hermione said. "A boggart is an amortal shape-shifting non-being that will take on the worst fear of whoever views it.""Correct! Five points to Gryffindor." Remus said approvingly. "Now, the way to repel a boggart is a simple charm. Repeat after me, Riddikulus!""Riddikulus!" The class obediently repeated."This class sounds ridiculous." Blaise muttered. He narrowed his eyes when Harry threw him a dirty look."Very good. Now the way to change the form your boggart turns into is to imagine something humorous. Laughter is the key to getting rid of a boggart as it confuses them. Whatever form the boggart takes, imagine it instead as something funny." He gestured to the cabinet which was shaking randomly. "Who would like to go first? How about you Mr.-""Longbottom. Neville." Neville said nervously."Do you know what your greatest fear is Neville?" Remus asked.Neville looked embarrassed. "Professor Snape." He admitted. Giggles were heard behind him and he blushed more. The Slytherins just rolled their eyes though some look amused.Remus laughed. "Yes, Professor Snape is a bit scary. Now, I believe you live with your Grandmother correct?"Neville nodded. "Yes but I wouldn't want the boggart to turn into her either!"Remus smiled. "All I want you to imagine is your grandmother's favorite outfit. Get a clear picture of it in your head and when your boggart appears, point your wand and say the charm while still focusing on the outfit. All right?"Neville nodded and took out his wand. Remus opened the cabinet and suddenly Professor Snape walked out and headed straight for Neville, a glower on his face. Neville pointed at him and incanted, "Riddikulus!"The class burst into laughter as Professor Snape was suddenly wearing a dress, a purple hat and carrying a red handbag. The boggart began looking around in confusion.The Slytherins tried not to laugh as they respected their Head of House but it was hard not to chuckle at sight of their Professor in old woman's clothes. Harry bit his lip trying not to grin and saw Daphne doing the same. Their eyes connected and they both ended up laughing."All right whose next?" Remus turned on some music as everyone began lining up.Ron stepped up and the boggart changed to a huge spider causing many students to yelp with fear. Ron said the charm and suddenly the spider had skates on all eight legs. Ron burst into laughter at the sight.Harry was still laughing at all the funny boggarts he had seen when it was his turn. The room began to get very cold and the boggart slowly changed into a dark shape, dressed in a hooded cloak of black cloth. Harry froze as he felt cold inside and a woman's scream once again filled his mind. "Not Harry, not my baby!" There was a flash of green and a high pitched laugh.Harry vaguely heard yelling and the next thing he knew he was lying on the ground, surrounded by his friends and Professor Lupin. "Harry, are you okay?" Remus asked as he helped Harry sit up.Harry wasn't. He now understood what he was hearing. His mother. He closed his eyes. "Harry?" Daphne said softly, putting her hand on his arm. "You're all right now.""He's not all right, he fainted didn't he?" Ron snapped, clearly not appreciating that Harry's new friends were edging him and Hermione away from Harry. "This is the second time!""What a baby, fainting like that." Pansy snickered as she stood watching with the rest of the class."Shut up Parkinson!" Draco glared at her.Pansy frowned and huffed, looking away.Harry opened his eyes and stood up, feeling shaky. He shook his head when Professor Lupin offered him a bar of chocolate. He felt like he was going to be sick and didn't want to eat anything."Harry, you need this." Remus said softly, his brown eyes clearly worried. "Just one bite at least?""N-no." Harry still felt chilled and backed away."I think you should go to the infirmary." Remus decided. "Class is dismissed." He put his hand on Harry's shoulder and began guiding him out of the room. His friends followed."What happened?" Poppy demanded when her infirmary was suddenly filled. She noticed Harry's pale face. "Mr. Potter?""We were studying boggarts in class and his turned into a dementor." Remus told her quietly."Those disgusting creatures should not be even near this school, let alone on its premises." Poppy said as she ran her wand over Harry. "Has he had chocolate?""He wouldn't eat it." Remus said."I feel sick; I don't want to eat anything." Harry said, his teeth chattering a bit. He felt so cold and full of sorrow. He could still hear his mother's voice in his head.The door opened and Snape walked in with Theo and Tracey behind him. "Great job teaching Lupin." Snape snarled. "Even I haven't had a student sent to the infirmary in the first class." He looked at Harry, concern in his eyes. "You will feel better when you have the chocolate.""I feel sick." Harry said softly, hating that he felt so weak.Snape lifted his wand and whispered a spell and instantly there was a mug of hot chocolate on the table next to Harry. "Sip that slowly and be careful, it is hot." Snape said and handed the mug to Harry. Harry took it and the first sip swiftly filled him with warmth. Wow. Now this was hot chocolate."Are you feeling any better?" Snape asked, pleased to see some color come back into Harry's face.Harry nodded. "Yes sir. Thank you." He took another sip and felt more warmth flood through him. He felt less cold and less sad. He looked up at Snape. "I heard her." He whispered. "Just like on the train, only more loudly."Snape frowned. "Heard whom?""My Mum." Harry answered, looking down at his mug of hot chocolate. He didn't see the way Snape stiffened. "I didn't know who the scream was on the train but this time I heard her. She was pleading for my life and then there was a flash of green and laughter." He looked up, his emerald eyes deeply grieved.Snape stared at him for a moment. Harry had just heard his mother's last moments? Dear Merlin. Snape wouldn't be able to stand it if it were him. Without even realizing he was doing it, he put his hand on Harry's shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. "I'm so sorry Harry." He murmured. "After you finish your drink, head back to your common room with your friends. We will talk later, all right?"Harry nodded.Snape instructed his students to make sure Harry got back to the dungeons, that he was to rest and that he would be there to speak to him soon. He ignored Ron and Hermione who were standing in the corner of the room looking confused to Snape's behavior. Snape went right up to Remus. "Are you completely incompetent?" He hissed."I didn't mean for this to happen." Remus said, looking upset. "I did not think his boggart would turn into a dementor! In fact, I had planned to stop him before he faced the boggart.""That worked out really well didn't it Lupin?" Snape said sarcastically. "Would you like to know what he experienced? He heard Lily's last moments!"Remus's eyes widened. "No. I wasn't aware that…" He trailed off. "Poor Harry.""I believe the boggart turning into the Dark Lord would have been less traumatizing!" Snape continued, glaring at Remus. "That child has been through enough and he does not need this as well!"Remus frowned. "What do you mean he has been through enough?"Snape rolled his eyes. "Ask the Headmaster." He said shortly.Remus nodded. "I will. Severus, I still do not understand why Harry is in your house. I hope you aren't treating him as if he is James. Even if he is like James-""He is not." Snape interrupted. "Unlike Potter senior, Harry does not bully students or think he is the center of the universe." If Snape had been told before school started that he would have been saying these things, he would have laughed his head off.Remus stayed silent. "I'm glad he's not." He said finally. He sighed. "I'd like to talk to him. Tell him about his parents. I'm not sure what his relative's told him but I could tell him stories of when they were in school."At first Snape wanted to say absolutely not as he did not want Harry near the werewolf. Having Lupin working here just brought back more bad memories of his school days. But he realized that Harry should know about his parents. Snape could tell him about Lily as a child and someday he probably would but there was nothing positive he could tell the child about his father, except for the fact that James had died trying to protect his family. Harry deserved to hear good things though and Lupin could provide that. "Perhaps," Snape said slowly. "You could teach Potter to cast a Patronus. It is advanced but I think he could do it and even if he could not produce a fully corporeal one he could do enough to help him. It would give you a chance to share your stories." He ignored the beaming smile on Poppy's face. Honestly, his reputation was going to be completely ruined before this year was out he just knew it. Hmm, perhaps he should issue out even more detentions and loss of points. That should help plus it was always fun.Remus smiled. "That is an excellent idea Severus, thank you. I will discuss it with him during our next class." He hesitated. "Obviously you are a very good Head of House to Harry, I apologize for insinuating otherwise."Severus inclined his head and then turned and stalked out of the room. He had wasted enough time with the annoying wolf.HPHPHPHPA couple of days later, Harry sat in the common room idly thumbing through his charms text. He was having a hard time concentrating as his mind was preoccupied with Dementor's, the fight with Draco, and concerns of what would happen when summer came around. What if Snape changed his mind about being his guardian? Snape had seemed adamant about it when they had talked after the Dementor incident, but as it wasn't official yet Harry still worried."Sickle for your thoughts." Daphne teased as she stood in front of him.Harry smiled ruefully. "Too many thoughts, I'm afraid.""Hmm." Daphne looked thoughtful. "Do you want to go take a walk? It's a nice day out and we can talk about anything or nothing." She shrugged. "It's a good way to clear your mind."Harry stood up. "Sounds like a good idea to me. I can't concentrate on my homework anyway.""Are you looking forward to your first Quidditch match this year?" Daphne asked as they walked out of the castle."Yeah. I love playing. Although with Ron's reaction I am a little nervous." Harry admitted. "What if everyone else has the same reaction? I don't want to upset anyone but I really do want to play.""You shouldn't feel guilty for playing. It's Quidditch; it's supposed to be fun for everyone. And you're still being loyal to Gryffindor by not playing against them." Daphne pointed out. She grinned mischievously. "I admit though, I'm looking forward to seeing you play as a Slytherin. Hufflepuff won't know what hit them!"Harry laughed. "Hufflepuff doesn't get a lot of credit but they have some solid players.""Not as good as our players!" Daphne sang out, making Harry grin. They stopped by Hagrid's hut and Fang came running out to greet Harry."Hey boy!" Harry said, petting the large yet sweet dog. "Daphne, have you met Fang?""Um, not officially." Daphne reached out her hand for Fang to sniff before she gently scratched him behind his ears."Ello Arry! Ello Daphne!" Hagrid greeted them."Hi Hagrid. How do you like teaching so far?" Harry asked.Hagrid grinned. "So fer it has bin wonderful! I have something special planned fer yer next class!""I like Hagrid but that makes me a little nervous." Daphne said after Hagrid and Fang had left. They continued their walk to the lake."Me too." Harry admitted with a chuckle. He watched the squid floating over the lake."Harry, how are you really doing?" Daphne asked after awhile.Harry ran his hand through his hair. "I don't know. So much has changed in such a short time. Mostly good changes though but it is a lot to take in." He sighed. "I'm worried that other people will find out about the Dursley's. I don't want anyone else to know. I know you guys and Snape won't say anything but well, what if someone had overheard Draco? I'd never live down the fact that I let my relatives hurt me."Daphne looked him straight in the eyes. "You did not let them do anything! You're a child and they failed in their responsibility to you. Believe me, I know how easy it is to assume the blame but-""You know?" Harry asked, remembering her making a comment like that before when she told him to trust Snape.Daphne sighed and nodded. "My Dad." She admitted. "He wasn't a nice man. He was also a big supporter of You-Know-Who. My Mum hated that he was and they fought about it a lot. She refused to join and after You-Know-Who's downfall he got more violent. As I got older I saw them argue and he..." She trailed off. "He hit her." She whispered. "He began hitting me when I tried to stop him and he slapped Astoria once. Mum took us and left but he wouldn't leave us alone. He wanted to take up where You-Know-Who left off and got into a fight with other Death Eaters who wanted to do the same thing. He was killed in a fight with them." Tears fell from her eyes. "I was so relieved that he couldn't hurt us anymore. Isn't that awful? He died and I was happy about it."Harry put his arm around Daphne. "No, it's not awful." He said softly. "You and your family were finally safe from someone who was hurting you and may have done even worse to your family."Daphne nodded. "I know. And honestly I don't consider him my Dad anymore. My Mum eventually remarried to a good man and he has been a great Dad." Daphne smiled slightly. "He's a muggle which was another reason Astoria was so upset about Draco's comment.""Oh." Harry's eyes lit in understanding. "Poor kid. So how does he feel about magic?""My Dad? He's fine with it. My Mum told him everything before they got married and he is super supportive." Daphne answered. "I told you this because I want to you know that I do understand a bit of what you have been through, being hurt by someone who is supposed to love you."Harry shrugged. "The Dursley's never wanted me though.""They took you in didn't they?" Daphne pointed out. "If they took you in then they were essentially agreeing to take care of you and have you be a part of their family. They didn't do that obviously and they should be ashamed of themselves." She looked intently at Harry as if willing him to accept what she was saying."You sound like Snape." Harry teased."Professor Snape is good at helping kids through abuse. He talked to me when he found out I was having nightmares about my biological Dad during my first year. He's helped a lot of kids actually, whether it be just talking it out or removing them from their home." Daphne said. "That is why he is respected by us. He might not be warm and cuddly but he does care."Harry held back a snicker at the comment of Snape being warm and cuddly but he did nod in agreement to what Daphne was saying. Snape had been more than helpful to Harry and he was even willing to take him in to keep him from the Dursley's. Harry hadn't respected the man before but he did now. "Can you keep a secret? I mean, it's not official yet.""I won't tell anyone. What is it?" Daphne asked curiously."Snape is going to be my guardian." Harry told her.Daphne's blue eyes widened. "That's wonderful! You'll never have to worry about your relative's again and he will protect you!" She threw her arms around him. "I'm so happy for you Harry. I know he is strict and well, scary but he really will watch out for you."Harry held her and absently noted her hair smelled of vanilla. She pulled back and he smiled at her. "I believe he will too." He admitted. "It's so weird to think that after the last two years of animosity between us. But I've been learning that many people aren't what I thought they were.""Ahh like Slytherins? Well, most Slytherins." Daphne amended. She wrinkled her nose. "Pansy and Blaise and their group are not a good example of what it means to be a Slytherin.""Daphne, thank you for telling me about your past. It helped." Harry said after a moment.Daphne titled her head to one side. "Do you think any less of me? Do you think I'm weak now?"Harry looked startled. "Of course not! It wasn't your fault and there was nothing you could do…" He trailed off."There was nothing you could do either. I know it will take time for you to believe it and I understand that you have been through more than I even know but I still think you should tell Ron and Hermione." Daphne said softly.Harry sighed in exasperation. "Why?""Because it will bother you until you do." Daphne said matter-of-factly. "You three are close and it must be hard to keep something like that from them.""I'll think about it." Harry said finally."Ready to head back? I have to make up something to predict for Divination." Daphne rolled her eyes."Yeah, me too." Harry said. He made a face. "I should never have signed up for that class. I mean, our first lesson and she predicts my death."Daphne laughed. "Right, the grim." She shrugged. "Ignore her, I heard that she predicts the death of a student every year and is always wrong." She grinned. "I suppose we must broaden our minds and look beyond!" She said, mimicking Professor Trelawney.They were almost back at the castle when they stopped suddenly."Hey Potter is it true that you are playing Quidditch on the snakes team?" Sixth years Cormac McLaggen and Alexander Williams had walked up to them and were sneering at them."I'm playing on my House team yes." Harry narrowed his eyes. He remembered how Cormac had acted when it was announced Harry would be put in Slytherin."They're supporters of You-Know-Who! They want him to return!" Cormac continued angrily. "They are all Death Eaters in training.""No, not all of them are." Harry said firmly."Unbelievable. Already he is sticking up for them. You've been corrupted Potter." Alexander said in disgust. "We expect better of our hero.""I'm not anyone's hero nor do I want to be!" Harry said angrily."Why don't you two just keep walking?" Daphne added."Shut up Death Eater wannabe!" Alexander hissed."Don't talk to her like that!" Harry stood in front of Daphne protectively."How can you be friends with them? How can you even stand it?" Alexander said in disgust."Yeah, you may be forced to be in Slytherin but if you were a true Gryffindor you wouldn't befriend any of them. And you certainly wouldn't play Quidditch on their team!" Cormac spat out."Just tell us that they are slimy snakes that can't be trusted and we'll know you haven't been corrupted." Alexander said, crossing his arms over his chest."I have nothing to prove to you." Harry said coldly. "Let's go Daphne." He turned and began walking away."No! Harry, behind you!"Harry quickly turned around with his wand out. "Protego!"The curse Cormac threw hit the shield."Are you crazy!" Daphne yelled at Cormac."It wouldn't have killed him. He needs a shock to get him back on track." Cormac said as he put his wand away."Mr. Potter why do you have your wand pointed at another student yet again?" Professor McGonagall demanded. She had just rounded the corner to find them."I was protecting myself Professor." Harry answered.Professor McGonagall looked around. "Protecting yourself from what?""McLaggen threw a curse at Harry!" Daphne said, glaring at Cormac and Alexander.Professor McGonagall stared at the two sixth years. "Is this true gentlemen?""No Professor. I just told Harry to be careful around the Slytherins just in case they tried to prank him and he pulled his wand on me." Cormac lied."That's not true!" Harry protested. "Daphne saw!""She's in his House of course she will lie to protect him!" Alexander said with a smirk on his face.Professor McGonagall sighed. "Mr. Potter, this is not the first time you have attacked students this year." She said finally."I didn't attack him Professor!" Harry couldn't believe it. Suddenly he remembered what his housemates said about Slytherins not being treated fairly."You had your wand trained on him Mr. Potter. I have to go by what I see." Professor McGonagall said regretfully. "Twenty points from Slytherin and I will be speaking to Professor Snape about this."Harry stared at her, shocked and hurt by the injustice. Without another word he turned and walked away, ignoring Professor McGonagall's call for him to come back.Harry walked up to the owlery, a place he liked to go to think. Daphne was with him but kept silent, sensing that he needed to think."It's not fair. It's just like with Sinistra." Harry finally said. He chuckled ruefully, even though he didn't find the situation funny. "I guess that's childish of me to say. I know things in life are not fair.""I know you do." Daphne said softly. She smiled as Harry pet Hedwig. "She is a beautiful owl.""This is Hedwig. She was my first birthday present that I remember getting." Harry said, looking at his familiar fondly. "Hagrid got her for me when he took me to get my school supplies."Daphne looked at him sadly. The first time he remembered getting a gift was when he was eleven? And by someone who was a stranger to him?They were both quiet for a moment. "What happened with McGonagall that just happens to us. Just like in class with Professor Sinistra. In Slytherin, if it's something like this, something unfair, no one gets mad. Now if a Slytherin actually deserves the points they lose that's a different story. Then everyone gets upset, especially Professor Snape as we lose enough points unfairly as it is."Harry shook his head. "It wasn't right. You were my witness and she didn't care. I mean, this time I used my wand simply to protect myself and not to throw a hex and I still got in trouble."Daphne touched his arm gently. "I know. Don't worry about it Harry it's not worth getting upset over.""Thank you." Harry said as they began walking to their tower."For what?" Daphne asked curiously."For listening to me. It helped. Again." Harry told her."Talking things over does help, whether it is something that is upsetting you or something bad that happened to you." Daphne hinted."I thought Slytherins were supposed to be subtle." Harry rolled his eyes as they entered their common room."I don't think subtle always works with you." Daphne threw him a grin.Harry laughed, feeling much better than he had earlier.TBC: Review if you can! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Hope you enjoy this chapter! "We're down twenty points." Blaise said suddenly standing in front of them, staring at Harry. "Know anything about that Potter?""Yes." Harry said shortly."I knew it! He is going to spend this term losing Slytherin as many points as possible!" Pansy accused him."I am not!" Harry yelled. "What I am is sick of being accused of things I didn't do!""Lay off Parkinson and let him explain." Draco said, standing up from where he had been studying on the sofa.Harry looked at him in surprise. He was surprised Draco was still sticking up for him after their fight."I would like to hear his explanation as well." Snape had entered the room during the yelling. "I heard you pulled your wand on Mr. McLaggen?""You pulled a wand on a Gryffindor?" Draco asked incredulously."No. I used a Protego when he cast a hex at me while my back was turned." Harry answered, aware that they had the attention of everyone in the common room. He wondered if Snape would not believe him as well.Snape narrowed his eyes. "Did you not tell Professor McGonagall this?"Harry looked at him, a hint of sadness and confusion in his eyes. "I did. She didn't believe me. Daphne was there and backed me up but she still didn't seem to believe me. Apparently because of what happened on the first day of school she said she had to go by what she saw.""Do you think that is the only reason?" Daphne asked quietly.Harry was silent for a moment. "And maybe because I am a Slytherin now." He admitted. He hated thinking that would have anything to do with it but after his experience with Sinistra he had to admit it was a possibility. McGonagall had basically ignored Daphne.Snape's face darkened. "Did she cast a spell on the wands to see what had been cast last?"Harry shook his head.Snape glared at the wall. Once again, a Slytherin gets attacked and a Gryffindor gets away with it. And the fact that even Harry was not exempt from this unfairness surprised him. It looked like he would have to have a talk with McGonagall just like he did with Sinistra. "Thirty points awarded for defending yourself." He said finally.Harry's eyes widened. Snape had given him points? That was a first.Snape rolled his eyes and smirked. "Don't look so shocked. You handled the situation correctly so the points are deserved.""Thank you Sir." Harry smiled. Snape gave him a nod and then left the common room.Feeling better, Harry went to join his friends when Draco intercepted him."May I speak with you for a moment?" Draco asked quietly."Okay." Harry said, curious as to what Draco would say.Draco took a deep breath. "I'm really sorry for what I said. I didn't mean it at all. I blurt out stupid things sometimes. Well, a lot of times. And it's weird, I mean I thought I hated you but you're actually not too bad to be around."Harry raised an eyebrow. "Um, thanks?""I thought I was supposed to act a certain way you know? I thought that was how my father wanted me to act." Draco gave a shrug. "I honestly don't know what he expects from me. All I do know is that I regret what I said. And I hope you can forgive me." He looked a little uncomfortable, as if he wasn't used to apologizing.Harry studied him for a second and then nodded. "I forgive you."Draco threw his hands up. "Honestly Potter you are just like Astoria. Way too forgiving. Aren't you going to make me wait or grovel or something?""Nope. I believe you mean it." Harry said trying not to laugh at Draco's flabbergasted expression. "Did you apologize to Tabitha?""Yes. She forgave me, especially when I promised to bring her and Astoria sweets from Hogsmeade." Draco said smugly.Harry laughed though he remembered that he wouldn't be able to go to Hogsmeade. He could ask Snape since he was going to be his guardian, he supposed. But he had a feeling that with Sirius Black still on the loose he wouldn't get the answer he wanted."Did Draco apologize for being a stuck-up, spoiled mean little-""Yes. Everything is fine now." Harry interrupted Theo. Theo looked satisfied."It's almost time for dinner." Tracey said."Great! I'm starving!" Theo led the way out of the common room. "We should really think of a way to get back at those Gryffindors Harry. We can't let them get away with treating you like that."Before Harry could answer Graham swept in front of the little group, stopping them in their tracks. "Absolutely not. You know Professor Snape will find a way to deal with them. Plus, if you get into trouble you could get suspended from Quidditch. We play Gryffindor in a couple of weeks and we can get back at them by winning.""I'll be playing seeker then, I'll make sure we win by a lot of points." Draco said confidently.Theo snickered. "You haven't won against Gryffindor yet." He quickly side stepped Draco's punch. "I'm just kidding! Even though it is, well, true."Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing as the look on Draco's face suggested that would not be a good idea. He knew he would be conflicted during the Slytherin and Gryffindor game. He was a part of Slytherin and wanted them to do well but he was also still a Gryffindor and wanted them to win too. He supposed he would be happy with whichever team won that day and feel bad for whichever team lost. "As you won't be focused simply on besting me, you should do well." He told Draco.Draco made a face. He had been told off last year by the Quidditch captain and Professor Snape that he needed to play with skill and speed and not just try to make Potter look bad. His father had also mentioned it that day he had come to watch a match and Draco had humiliated himself in trying to beat just Potter and not put his mind in the actual game. Hopefully now he could show what he could do on the field. He may not be as fast as Potter but he knew he could play quite well."First things first. Our game against Hufflepuff." Graham rubbed his hands together in anticipation. "Tomorrow we are going to show everyone why Slytherin is not a team to be underestimated."Harry grinned. He was excited to play again. He just hoped he did his new team proud.HPHPHPHPHarry hovered above the ground with his eyes searching for a flash of gold. So far they were a little bit ahead of Hufflepuff and if he could get the snitch, they would win. When he had flown up into the sky with the Slytherin team he had heard some booing and jeers from some of the students but was trying to ignore it. He really didn't see what the hostility was about but he couldn't please everyone he supposed.He cheered with the rest of his teammates when Draco threw the Quaffle through the hoop, scoring Slytherin ten points. He concentrated on looking for the Snitch when suddenly it grew dark and cold. Thinking a storm was starting, Harry looked up and felt his heart drop. It wasn't clouds that were making everything dark and cold it was the Dementors. They began to swarm right above him and he once again froze, hearing his Mum screaming and pleading for his life."Step aside silly girl!" "No not Harry! Kill me instead!"Harry couldn't think, couldn't concentrate on anything except his mum's voice. The next thing he knew he had fallen from his broom and there was nothing he could do to save himself. He vaguely heard yells and gasps and the last thing he remembered as his fall felt slower was a bright light surrounding him.HPHPHPHPHarry began to stir back into consciousness and the first thing he heard was Snape's voice and he sounded angry."This is completely unacceptable; get rid of those creatures Albus! He could have been killed!""Severus, if I could get rid of them I would. The ministry insists on having them here until Sirius is caught. I have alerted them to what has occurred and they promised it would not happen again.""As if they can control them." Snape scoffed. "They are more harmful than helpful. They should not be here and they should not be around Harry!""It almost seems like they are especially attracted to Harry." Another voice said thoughtfully. Professor Lupin? Harry wondered drowsily, still not able to open his eyes. "I would guess the crowd of so many people was hard to resist but why focus on Harry?""Unfortunately, Harry has many bad memories for them to feed on." Dumbledore said regretfully."Many bad memories? It would just be the night James and Lily were killed although that was horrific enough, of course." Professor Lupin said sadly."Harry has more in his past than that terrible night I regret to say." Dumbledore said quietly. "But that is for him to share with you if he chooses."Harry finally was able to open his eyes and saw the Headmaster and the two Professors standing next to his bed in the infirmary. He groaned. "One year. Just one year." He mumbled."One year what Harry?" Snape asked in confusion, stepping closer to hear Harry better and handing him his glasses."I'd like just one year to not end up in the infirmary." Harry said, struggling to sit up a bit. He bit back a cry as his muscle's protested."I would not mind that as well. Perhaps next year that could be your goal." Snape said dryly and then called for Poppy."He's awake, very good!" Poppy bustled over and began running diagnostics over him. She then handed him a vial. "Take this pain reliever Mr. Potter. Thankfully, the Headmaster cast a cushioning charm to absorb your fall but it was still a jolt to your body. No broken bones or sprains though. The potion should take care of any lingering soreness."Harry drank the potion and the lingering pain immediately went away. He sighed in relief and handed back the vial. "Thank you Madame Pomfrey."Poppy nodded. "Rest for awhile more and then you can leave."Harry leaned back against his pillows. "What happened? I mean, I know the Dementor's showed up but what happened with the game?""That is not important Harry. What is important is that you are all right." Snape said, side stepping the question. He hesitated. "Did you hear your mother again?" He asked softly.Harry paled a bit as he remembered. "Yes." He whispered. "He was telling her to get out of the way and she refused, asking him to kill her instead." Tears filled his eyes to his horror and he looked away, not wanting to cry in front of anyone. "She sounded so desperate." He added in a thick voice.Snape inhaled at that and closed his eyes briefly as a wave of grief went through him. Lily. He opened his eyes and found himself looking into teary emerald eyes. Familiar eyes. He put his hand on the back of Harry's neck gently in a gesture of comfort. Harry leaned back into his hand and few drops fell down his cheeks. "Is there really a way to repel them? Because I can't take another run in with them."Professor Lupin was looking at him with pain in his eyes. "Yes, as I told you the other day there is a charm I would like to teach you. It is what Professor Dumbledore used to get rid of them today. The Patronus Charm. It is advanced but as Professor Snape told me, you could likely pick it up or at least enough to help if another situation like this arises."Harry looked at Snape curiously. "It was your idea for me to learn the Patronus Charm? Why-why don't you teach me?" He asked, a part of him wondering if it was because Snape didn't want to spend any more time with him than he had to."I have no problem teaching you." Snape said smoothly, seeing the insecurity in Harry's eyes. "However, Professor Lupin is not only adept to teach you but is also able to provide you with something that I am not."Harry looked from Professor Lupin to Snape in confusion. "What?"Professor Lupin stepped forward. "I, like Professor Snape, went to school with your parents. In fact, your father was one of my best friends and Professor Snape thought you might like to hear stories about him. I was friends with your mother as well."Harry's face lit up. "That would be brilliant, thank you!" He looked at Snape and smiled. "Thank you." He said again, knowing that Snape had hated his father although he still didn't know why. And yet still Snape had arranged for him to have lessons where he could also hear about his parents.Suddenly the infirmary doors opened and a group of students came in.Poppy sighed. "It is not visiting hours, honestly!""We just want to know if he is okay." Graham said. With him were Theo, Draco, Daphne, Tracey and a couple of other Slytherins from the team.Before Poppy could answer Ron and Hermione entered. "Harry? Are you all right?" Hermione asked worriedly."Why are you two here?" Draco asked snidely."If you are here just to upset him-" Daphne started."We're not! We were worried about him. He could have died!" Ron protested, glaring at them. He looked at Harry. "No matter what, you are our best friend. We just want to make sure you are okay.""And also to say that we are sorry for the other day." Hermione added, regret clear in her eyes.Harry gave them a reassuring smile. "It's okay. I'm okay. I'm glad you're here. All of you.""You can take the boy out of the lion's den but you can't take the lion out of the boy." Draco muttered. "Forgives way too easily.""So what happened with the game?" Harry asked eagerly after he shot Draco a glare.Graham exchanged looks with Draco and Theo. "Well, we lost. Diggory caught the snitch before he realized you were falling. Madame Hooch said it counted even though Diggory offered to do a rematch.""Oh. I'm really sorry." Harry said dejectedly. He agreed it was fair that Hufflepuff won but if he wasn't so weak around those stupid Dementors…"Don't be sorry. It wasn't your fault." Graham said reassuringly."What happened to my broom? Did someone grab it for me?" Harry asked as he adjusted his glasses."Um," Graham hedged."Well, you see-" Theo began and then trailed off."Your broom kind of…um…" Daphne looked at her friends helplessly."There once was a Whomping Willow that tore apart a broom." Ron started."Ron!" Hermione hissed.Harry paled and looked at Snape. "My broom got destroyed?""Better the broom than you." Snape said not without sympathy."Can it be fixed?" Harry asked hopefully.Snape shook his head regretfully. "No, the damage is too great. We'll look into getting a replacement all right?""Until then there are the school brooms." Graham said, though his tone made it clear he didn't think that was such a good thing."You could use one of our brooms when you play." Theo offered and Draco nodded in agreement.Ron was staring at them like he couldn't believe they were being so generous. He glanced at Hermione who was watching the exchange curiously with a small smile on her face."Thanks." Harry said softly. He couldn't believe his broom had been destroyed and all because he couldn't handle the Dementors. He had to learn that Patronus Charm."You've all seen him and now you may go." Snape said firmly. He wanted Poppy to do another check over Harry to make sure he was okay. He could also see the emotions over the boys face; he was too easy to read at times. He obviously was thinking badly of himself because of how the Dementors affected him."We just got here!" Ron complained.Snape leveled him with a scowl. "Do I appear to care? Go now. All of you!"The Slytherins said goodbye to Harry and obediently left the infirmary while Ron and Hermione lingered, hoping to still talk to Harry.Before Snape could take points Harry gave his friends a reassuring smile. "I'm okay and I will talk to you guys later.""We're glad you weren't hurt." Hermione said as she pulled Ron with her out of the infirmary.HPHPHPHP"How long do I have to stay here?" Harry asked, desperately wanting to leave the infirmary. Merlin, he hated it here."Until Madame Pomfrey says you can go." Snape answered. "I would like her to check you over again and make sure-""But I'm fine!" Harry practically whined."Do not throw a tantrum; you are not a two year old!" Snape snapped. "And do not interrupt me. You will stay here until I am satisfied that you are truly all right. Am I understood?"Harry gave a defeated sigh. "Yes Sir." He mumbled.Snape glared at Remus who was smiling at them. "Something to say Lupin?"Remus shook his head. "No." He was still smiling. "I should go though. I'm happy you are okay Harry. I will let you know soon when we will start our lessons all right?""The sooner the better." Harry told him with a faint smile.After Remus had left Snape called for Poppy. "Would you check him over one more time?"Poppy ran her wand over Harry to cast a diagnostic. "Are you feeling any pain Mr. Potter?""No Ma'am." Harry answered.Poppy looked satisfied. "You are free to go then Mr. Potter. I do suggest getting a good night's rest." She looked at Snape. "You may want to provide a vial of dreamless sleep for him after today's events."Snape nodded. "Good idea. Thank you Poppy." He gestured for Harry to follow him. "You will go to the common room and rest until dinner. I would ask you to go rest in your dorm and take a nap but unless I put a sticking charm on you I doubt you would. After dinner it is back to the common room and I want you to go to bed at a decent hour.""A sticking charm? Dreamless sleep? A nap? I'm not a baby." Harry complained."You do an excellent imitation of one." Snape remarked as they walked.Harry huffed. "I need to learn that Patronus Charm right away. Then those things will leave me alone."Snape stopped walking and turned to Harry. "It does take time to learn the Charm." He cautioned. "Do not think after one lesson that you will be able to ward off the Dementors. You must have patience when you are learning it."Harry shrugged. "I know. I just wish they would catch Sirius Black and send those things away. What do I do if they come to the next game I play? I already cost Slytherin a win.""That was not your fault. I told you; the important thing is that you are all right." Snape said. "As for the Dementors, the Headmaster will make sure they do not come near the students again." Or else, Snape thought furiously. "Go rest and I will see you at dinner.""Thank you Professor." Harry offered him a grin and went to the common room.TBC: Please Review! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Hope you enjoy this chapter! =)"Harry, are you okay? You fell from so high up!" Astoria ran up to him and hugged him.Harry smiled down at her. "I'm fine Astoria. I'm not hurt at all.""What did Madame Pomfrey say?" Daphne asked as Harry walked over with Astoria holding his hand."That I'm fine." Harry sighed at the determined look in Daphne's eyes. "To rest. I'm supposed to rest and take dreamless sleep tonight." He rolled his eyes at the thought.Daphne pushed him onto the sofa. "Then rest. And I think the Dreamless Sleep is a good idea.""You don't need to fuss Healer Greengrass." Harry joked."I do not fuss." Daphne said indignantly."Do you want a blanket Harry?" Theo joked."How about a stuffed animal? Astoria probably has some." Draco snickered.Astoria gasped. "I do not!" She protested. She suddenly smirked. "You're the one with a stuffed dragon."Draco's mouth dropped open. "How did you-I mean, no I don't!" He sputtered. His face turned red and he glared at her. "Who told you that?""Theo." Astoria answered smugly."Boy I'm hungry. Isn't it time for dinner yet?" Theo asked nonchalantly. He sighed at Draco's glare. "I only told her after you were being a prat.""That means it could have been anytime this year." Tracey joked. She, Daphne and Harry began laughing."It was after he said that bad word." Astoria informed them."I only had that dragon my first year. My Mum slipped it into my suitcase without my knowing." Draco said stiffly.Harry and Theo exchanged a grin. "Of course that's what happened." Harry said smoothly."Yeah we believe you." Theo laughed."Anyone speaks of this and I will ruin you!" Draco hissed at them, his silver eyes flashing."Okay, we've been warned. So dinner anyone?" Harry smirked as he stood up. He grinned at Astoria. "By the way, you totally just made my year." Astoria grinned at him in return."Some great seeker you are." Millicent shot at him when Harry walked by her, Pansy and Blaise."Please, he did it on purpose. He wants Slytherin to lose." Blaise sneered."No I don't." Harry said shortly."Ignore them." Daphne said as they continued walking. "They're always unpleasant.""I can't blame them for being suspicious. I can't believe I ruined the game like that." Harry shook his head."It's just a game." Tracey commented."We'll win the rest, no big deal." Draco said breezily."Harry!" Hermione rushed up to the group of Slytherins when they entered the Great Hall. "Madame Pomfrey released you already? That's good, that means you're really okay.""Of course I am." Harry said exasperatedly."Guess I'm not the only one who fusses." Daphne smirked."Isn't your table over there?" Draco asked rudely."Don't you know how to be a gentleman?" Daphne asked.Draco shrugged. "When the situation calls for it.""Can Ron and I talk to you for a moment?" Hermione asked, ignoring Draco."Sure." Harry walked with her to where Ron was waiting."Hey mate." Ron said quietly. He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. "I was a complete prat the other day. I'm sorry. Hermione is right; you have been making the best out of a difficult situation. I guess I just reacted like that because I didn't expect you to get along with any of the Slytherins.""We were worried about losing your friendship." Hermione added.Harry looked at them in shock. "You will never lose my friendship! I love you guys.""Oh Harry!" Hermione threw her arms around him. "We love you too!"Ron rolled his eyes. "Girls!" He muttered.Hermione threw him a look and then turned back to Harry. "Whatever is going on with you," She began slowly. "We're here for you. You were right; it is up to you who you tell. We know something happened with you and we were scared for you. We're here if or when you want to talk about it."Harry gave her a grateful smile. "Thanks. I will tell you but I'm just not ready yet."Hermione took a deep breath and glanced at Ron. "Okay.""Do you want to sit with us?" Ron asked as he looked at all the food on the tables. "I'm starving!""Um, I don't know if it is allowed to eat at another House's table." Harry said thoughtfully. "I mean, I've never seen anyone else do it.""Me either. I don't remember reading anything about it in the Hogwarts rule book." Hermione said with a contemplative expression. "I'll have to-""Research it in the library." Ron finished for her with a resigned expression on his face.Hermione nodded. "Exactly. And I'll need-""Me to help." Ron sighed."Stop that." Hermione frowned.Harry grinned. He hadn't realized how much he had been missing them. "I'd offer to help but I have to rest this evening. Pomfrey and Snape's orders.""Lucky sod." Ron breathed under his breath.Harry laughed and promised to meet up with them tomorrow before heading to the Slytherin table. As soon as he sat down he began filling his plate."Everything okay?" Daphne asked as she took a bite of her chicken salad.Harry nodded. "Yup. And things will be even better once I learn the Patronus Charm.""You're going to learn how to cast a Patronus? That is very advanced." Daphne said, impressed."Why can't all of us learn it?" Draco asked enviously."Because the Dementors don't affect us the way they do Harry." Theo answered easily."I'm hoping to at least learn enough to help ward those creatures off, I doubt I'll be able to cast a true Patronus." Harry said. He felt better knowing he at least was doing something about the Dementors but what he was really looking forward to was hearing about his parents. It was about time that he learned more about them.HPHPHPHPSnape ate slowly, his eyes on his Slytherin table. Harry looked to be in good spirits as he talked with his new friends."Harry appears to be doing well." Minerva commented as she took a sip from her goblet. "I've been meaning to talk to you about him."Severus's eyes narrowed. He had been waiting for this. "I am sure you have. I have been meaning to talk to you as well." He said in a dark tone.Minerva raised her eyebrow slightly. "Oh? What about?""About your unfair, unjust treatment of Mr. Potter." Severus answered smoothly.Minerva's eyes widened. "What unfair treatment? Is this about the points I took? He had his wand trained on another student! The beginning of the year I had to stop him from hexing a student."Severus struggled to keep his temper under control. "The beginning of the year he was being bullied as well as suffering the effects of his summer and he reacted. Hexing another student is wrong, yes, but bullying should be treated the same. Were the Ravenclaws he almost hexed even reprimanded for their behavior to him?"Minerva frowned slightly. "I don't know." She said honestly. "I never talked to Professor Flitwick about it."Snape rolled his eyes. "Of course not.""I treated the situation as I saw fit." Minerva said stiffly. "I had to go by what I saw. He had his wand trained on two students.""Yes, and one of those students had cast a hex at him. Harry used Protego to defend himself! Miss. Greengrass tried to tell you this from what I heard." Snape said angrily."My students said that that didn't happen." Minerva said a little uncomfortably. "Therefore, I went by what I saw.""Gee, if only there was some way to test the wands to see what had been cast last." Snape said sarcastically. "Priori Incantato, perhaps?""I-." Minerva flushed. "I should have done that." She said finally. She sighed. "I was on my way to a meeting when I came across the students and I've been busy and tired, I honestly didn't even think of doing that. I should have, of course." Minerva said quietly."Yes you should have!" Snape snapped and his voice was a tad louder. "Do you know how Mr. Potter and Miss. Greengrass took your behavior? That because they are Slytherins, they must be liars. You didn't doubt your precious Gryffindors did you?""Severus."Snape looked over and saw that Dumbledore had been listening to their conversation. Dumbledore had a solemn look on his face. "Perhaps this should be discussed privately.""Why?" Snape countered. "Minerva is not the only one to show unfairness to my Slytherins is she?" He cast a nasty look at Sinistra, who quickly averted her eyes. He turned back to Minerva. "Do you know how hard it is to try and explain to my students why they are treated the way they are? I know my students are not perfect and there are times that they do things that do warrant points being taken or detentions given. But plenty of times they are punished unfairly.""You are guilty of this as well Severus. My Gryffindors get treated unfairly by you." Minerva shot back with a triumphant look."Despite what your little lions tell you, they actually do deserve chastisement for not being prepared for class or for goofing off. Although I do admit I treated Mr. Potter quite unfairly." Severus nodded. "I do know better now. But one reason I am hard on the other students is to make up for lies they have told or things they have gotten away with regarding my Slytherins. The students in my House need to know that someone is looking out for them.""I agree Severus." Dumbledore stated. "And this is something that should be addressed during our next faculty meeting."Severus snorted. It should have been addressed many years ago in his opinion. Such as the time he was treated as the villain after Black's little prank that almost got him killed.Minerva looked at Severus regretfully. "I should have checked the wands. I will be talking to my students and I will of course apologize to Mr. Potter." Suddenly her eyes narrowed. "Wait, what did you mean when you said Mr. Potter was suffering the effects of his summer?""Ahh Minerva. We will have to talk about that in private." Dumbledore said with a sigh. "As you will be Harry's Head of House again next term, it is something you should know."Severus ignored Minerva's questioning look and went back to eating his dinner. He wondered if once he was Harry's guardian he could insist that Harry stay in Slytherin. The truth was, Harry appeared to fit into his House and he frankly he didn't trust anyone else with looking after the child properly. Merlin, how things had changed.HPHPHPHPHarry entered Professor's Lupin's classroom for his first lesson. He was excited and nervous to finally learn some real defense this year. Last year Defense had been a joke and except for Snape's Expelliarmus they had learned nothing in Lockhart's class."You're here, wonderful." Remus smiled at his childhood friend's son. "Are you ready?"Harry nodded. "I'm ready. So how do you conjure a Patronus Charm?"Remus gestured for Harry to take a seat and leaned back in his char. "What I am going to try to teach you is a very powerful defensive charm, one of the most powerful known to wizard kind. It is also very difficult to do. In fact, many adult witches and wizards are unable to produce it. There is an incantation which will work only if you can concentrate on a single very happy memory.""A happy memory?" Harry asked uncertainly. Well, that ruled anything from his childhood out."I know it sounds too simple to defeat such horrible creatures but it can be harder than it sounds. The memory has to be strong. Very strong. You have to let the happiness of that memory consume you in order to produce a corporeal Patronus. Most can only produce a non-corporeal Patronus."Harry frowned. "Does a non-corporeal one not work?""It helps to ward off Dementors though it is not nearly as strong. It can however be enough to help you get away from them but it will not hold them off for long. The Patronus is a spirit guardian. You do not know what form of animal your Patronus will take until you cast it. A non-corporeal Patronus does not resemble any living creature; it only produces a smoky light." Remus answered. He tilted his head to one side. "Do you feel ready to try it?"Harry nodded determinedly. "I'm ready.""The incantation is Expecto Patronum." Remus said."Expecto Patronum." Harry repeated.Remus nodded and stood up. "Now I wasn't about to bring in a real Dementor, of course, so we will be using a boggart." Remus walked over to a trunk that was sitting in the middle of the room. He looked at Harry. "Do you have your happy memory firmly in your mind?"Harry thought frantically. The first time riding a broom stood out to him. That feeling of freedom and finally feeling like he was good at something. "Yes." Harry said."Okay, wand at the ready." Remus instructed. When Harry had his wand out he opened the trunk and a Dementor floated out.Focusing on his memory, Harry started the incantation. "Expecto Patronum!" He shouted. The Dementor began getting nearer and Harry started to feel cold. "Expecto-" He heard his Mum's screaming. "Expecto Patr…" The blackness and cold overcame him as her screams grew louder."Harry! Wake up!"Harry opened his eyes and saw Professor Lupin kneeling next to him. "Here, take a couple of bites of this it will help." Remus handed Harry a large square of chocolate.Harry took a bite and felt instantly better. "That didn't go well." He said dejectedly.Remus helped him up. "I would have been shocked if you had cast a Patronus on your first try. Remember, this is very advanced magic. What was the memory you used?""The first time I rode a broom." Harry answered, eyeing the trunk which was shaking from the boggart inside."That's not nearly strong enough." Remus frowned slightly. "The memory needs to be the happiest you ever felt." He looked at Harry curiously. "Are you having a hard time thinking of something that is happy?" There was concern in his voice."Um, no." Harry lied. "That memory was just a really fun one. Um, I'll think of another one." He quickly thought and remembered the day when he found out he was a wizard and that he would be able to be away from the Dursley's for most of the year. He remembered the feeling of relief and joy at that. The only thing that topped it was when Snape had told him that he wouldn't have to ever go back to the Dursley's, that they wouldn't have guardianship over him anymore. He was going to have a guardian who actually gave a care if he ate enough, did his homework, if he was safe. The little things most kids probably took for granted he was going to finally have himself. If that wasn't a happy memory he didn't know what was. "I'm ready."Remus looked uncertain for a moment and then nodded. "Okay. Here we go." He opened the trunk and once again a Dementor floated out.Harry ignored the cold and the screaming and focused on his memory. "Expecto Patronum!" The Dementor paused and then continued coming towards him. "Expecto Patronum!" He shouted loud and clear. A silvery mist shot out of his wand and he worked to keep his arm steady as the Dementor began to back away. Remus held the trunk open as the boggart was forced back into it by Harry."Excellent!" Remus beamed. "That was excellent Harry! Amazing actually, considering your age." He handed Harry another piece of chocolate.Harry took it and leaned against the wall, feeling exhausted. "I think I've had enough. For today, I mean."Remus nodded. "You did very well. Sit down and rest, the magic you just performed can be very draining when you are not used to it."Harry dropped into a chair and ate his chocolate. "It wasn't a full corporeal Patronus." He said."Harry, even casting a non-corporeal Patronus is something to be proud of. Especially since you are only thirteen." Remus said. He sat down across from Harry. "Now, to the other reason for our lesson. Your parents. Unless you are too tired to talk about them." He said in a teasing voice.Harry perked up. "No, I would really love to hear about them. I only know a few things that I was told when I came to Hogwarts.""Didn't your relatives tell you anything about them?" Remus asked.Harry snorted. "No. Well, not truthful things." He looked at Remus eagerly. "So what can you tell me about them?"Remus hesitated and decided not to comment on his relatives just yet. "James was one of my best friends. Almost everyone liked him. He had a quality that everyone just seemed drawn to and he enjoyed being the center of attention." Remus smiled in memory. "He also had a habit of getting into trouble. He was quite the prankster.""Really?" Harry grinned.Remus laughed. "Oh yes. He was usually able to charm his way out of trouble though. He was also an excellent Quidditch player. He loved the game and helped Gryffindor win many games. He'd be quite proud to know his son has followed his footsteps."Harry smiled softly. "What about my Mum? Were they friend's right away?""No." Remus snickered. "James liked her even in first year but Lily didn't like him. She thought he was an attention seeking prat, as she would put it."Harry laughed. "Really? When did start liking him then?""Sixth year is when they became friends. James had been chasing her for so long but it wasn't until he started to grow up and mature that she saw him differently. They started dating their seventh year." Remus said. "Your mother was one of the kindest people I have ever met. She was a good friend to me during a very dark time in my life. She was also one of the brightest students in our class.""What was her favorite subject?" Harry asked."She was exceptional at Charms and I think Potions was also a favorite of hers." Remus answered. "Both James and Lily were extremely loyal and brave. And they were so happy and excited when they were expecting you.""They were?" Harry asked softly, a small smile on his face."They loved you very much Harry." Remus told him. "They really did.""I know." Harry said, looking down at his hands. He was silent for a moment and then looked up curiously. "Wait, did you know me as a baby?"Remus grinned. "Yes. I even babysat you a couple of times."Harry groaned though he was laughing. "That's not embarrassing at all." He smiled at Remus. "Thank you for taking the time to tell me about them.""You're welcome Harry. I'm glad Severus thought of it." Remus cast a tempus. "It's almost time for dinner. We'll meet again in a few days to practice more."Harry stood up. "Sounds good. Thank you again Professor." He left the room feeling happy with the stories he had heard about his parents as well as hopeful that maybe with more practice he would be able to improve his Patronus. He wondered if he would be able to do it and if he did what form his Patronus would take.HPHPHPHPAfter dinner Harry was laughing with his friends when Snape swooped in and called him over. Harry went over to him briefly running in his mind anything he might have done wrong. "Yes Professor?""I just wanted to ask how your lesson went." Snape said."Okay I think. I can't cast a corporeal Patronus yet but I cast a non-corporeal one." Harry said. "I didn't know it would feel so draining."Snape nodded. "You are calling on powerful magic so your magical core will be slightly drained which is why you do not want to push yourself. Casting a non-corporeal Patronus on your first lesson is quite impressive however so do not feel so dejected.""He told me a little about my parents." Harry blurted out. He didn't know why he did as he knew Snape hated his dad.Snape stiffened slightly but inclined his head. "Good, I'm glad he did."Harry relaxed. "He said my Mum was really bright and that she excelled in Charms and Potions."Snape looked away for a moment. "She was extremely smart and talented. I was partnered with her a few times in our Potions class and she had a natural ability for the subject."Harry's curiosity perked up with interest. So while Snape had hated his father, it sounded like he had thought well of his mother. He wanted to ask more questions about it but Snape had already started talking again."You best be on your way. I'm sure you have last minute homework to scramble together." Snape gave him a knowing look."No…" Well, actually Harry did have some homework due tomorrow that he hadn't started yet. "I just need to, uh, finish a couple of things."Snape snorted. "Of course.""Oh, Professor?" Harry hesitated. "My relatives didn't sign my Hogsmeade form. I was wondering if you were able to? The first outing is this weekend."Snape looked regretful. "As I am not your official guardian yet, my signature would not be accepted. I am still waiting to get the papers drawn up and have your relatives sign them. All of that will be done by the next Hogsmeade weekend and by then I will be able to sign it. It may be better this way as Black is still out there. Hopefully by the next outing he will have been caught.""Oh. Okay." Harry's face fell."I know it is unfair." Snape said quietly. "Your safety is my priority however. But as I said, you will be able to go on the next Hogsmeade visit. Provided you behave yourself of course. Trips to Hogsmeade are a privilege, not a right." He gave a smirk."I know." Harry shrugged. "It's okay. I understand."Snape nodded and was impressed that Harry was taking it so well. In the past he would have assumed that the boy would throw a fit at not being able to go on the field trip. He changed the subject. "By the way, if I see you eat more desserts than actual food again I may have to hex everything you eat to taste like broccoli." He smirked at the disgusted look on Harry's face."Yuck. I hate broccoli. I thought I was supposed to gain weight?" He protested though he couldn't help laughing."You are, preferably in a healthy way." Snape rolled his eyes. "You best run along and finish your homework.""Yes sir." Harry turned to walk away but paused. "Sir? Since you partnered with my Mum in school, could you maybe tell me about her sometime? The only things I heard about them growing up were that my parents were drunks and my Mum was a freak."Snape inhaled his breath. "I'll make you a deal. I'll share some stories of her if you share more of your childhood with me."Harry made a face. That wasn't fair. Snape knew how much Harry wanted to learn anything he could about his parents. "Deal." He muttered. Sneaky Slytherin. "Goodnight Professor.""Goodnight Harry." Snape responded and turned to go to his quarters. Harry's comment about the Dursley's made him all the more anxious to visit them. He wanted their guardianship removed from the child they had abused. He also couldn't wait to have a word with them. In fact, he was very much looking forward to it.TBC: Let me know what you think! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you for the reviews! They make me so happy! =)Harry and his friends were outside working on their astronomy project. It was a nice day, cool but the sun was out and Harry had thought it would be more fun to work outside than in the library. Hermione and Ron were supposed to have joined them but they had gotten into a fight over their familiars so Hermione had stayed in the library to work and Harry didn't know where Ron had stomped off to."Your friends are pretty dramatic." Draco smirked as he leaned back on the grass, his hands behind his head.Harry shrugged and closed his Astronomy book. "They'll get over it. They fight and then they're friends again. It's what they do.""I don't get why Weasley is so upset. It's a cat's instinct to chase a rat." Draco closed his eyes.Daphne began pulling at the grass. "I think he just wants her to make sure her cat doesn't get into his dorm to go after the rat." She made a face. "I sound like a nursery rhyme." She sprinkled the grass onto Draco's face."Hey!" Draco batted at the grass on his face and glared at Daphne.Harry laughed. "I think Daphne wants to make sure you don't fall asleep before finishing our project." He commented."Precisely." Daphne grinned."We should take a break anyway. We could go to the lake and see if the squid is there." Tracey suggested."Fine with me. After this I have to work on Divination and I am more than happy to put that off." Harry said. Practically every time Trelawney looked at him she predicted his death.Suddenly Neville ran up to them. "Harry! You should come! He was in…and Ron…portrait slashed." Neville said breathlessly.Harry got up. "Take a breath. What happened?" He asked his friend in concern."It must be something big to make Longbottom run that fast." Draco remarked as he stood up as well."Be nice!" Tracey hissed."Why?" Draco asked with a shrug."What's going on?" Daphne asked, standing next to Harry."Ron found your guys' dorm ransacked. He heard a noise and saw Sirius Black running out of the room!" Neville said shakily. "He broke into the dorm he thought you would be in!"Harry felt frozen for a moment. Sirius Black had gotten into the castle? How? He looked at Daphne when she grabbed his arm, shock on her face."How could he have gotten into the castle?" Daphne asked Neville. "Did they catch him?"Neville shook his head. "No. The only ones who saw him were Ron and the Fat Lady.""Is Ron okay?" Harry asked worriedly."He looked really pale." Neville said, looking a little nervous as Draco, Theo, and Tracey also stood around him."I'm going to go see if he is okay." Harry said, already heading back to the castle."We'll come with you." Daphne said. "You shouldn't be alone anyway."When they got to Gryffindor Tower, they saw a group of students and Professors standing at the top of the stairs. The Portrait was empty and had a great big slash on it. Harry searched the nearby portraits and could see the Fat Lady peeking out from one across the stairs."Harry! Did you hear what happened?" Ron called when he saw Harry. He began making his way towards him with a gaggle of students following him."Yeah, you okay mate?" Harry asked. He saw Hermione standing off to the side with a worried expression on her face.Ron nodded. "It was crazy! I walked into the dorm and it was completely torn apart! I heard a noise and turned around and he was running out the door! He looked like a mad man, just like in his posters!""Did he say anything Ron?" Dean asked eagerly."Weren't you frightened?" Lavender asked, standing close to Ron.Ron looked around at all the students watching him and puffed out his chest a bit. "No, there wasn't any time to be frightened. He didn't say anything, he just ran away.""He was probably afraid you would hex him!" Lavender exclaimed, her face lit up in admiration."Well, of course I started to follow him, to stop him, but he was too fast." Ron said with a regretful sigh. He glanced over at Harry and winked.Harry stifled his laughter and Hermione huffed and rolled her eyes."I'm glad I had Scabbers already with me." Ron added, gesturing to the rat that was hiding in his book bag. "I couldn't risk a certain cat killing him." He threw a look in Hermione's direction."Crookshanks is not-" Hermione started angrily but was interrupted when Snape walked up to the group."All students will return to their dormitories to await further instructions from your Head of House." Snape announced in a loud voice. He glared when some students protested, clearly wanting to stay and hear more about the break in. "If I have to repeat myself…" Snape said in a low yet dangerous voice. He didn't even have to finish his sentence before students began scattering in different directions. He looked at his Slytherins. "Go straight to the common room. Harry, you are not to be alone. All of you be on guard. Am I understood?""Yes sir." Harry nodded to Ron and Hermione and then left with his friends. Draco and Theo were on either side of him with their wands clenched tightly in their hands. Daphne and Tracey were walking ahead of them. Harry sighed as this reminded him of last year when students had to be escorted everywhere because of the chamber being opened.When the quintet entered the Slytherin common room, students immediately began surrounding them. "Is what we heard true? Did Sirius Black attack you Potter?" Blaise asked as he stood with Pansy, Millicent, Gregory and Vincent. They had their usual sneers on their faces but looked curious as well."No. I didn't even see him." Harry answered shortly."We all have to stay here until Professor Snape comes to talk to us." Theo told Graham who nodded in understanding."All right, no one leaves. We wait for further instructions from our Head of House." Graham said firmly to everyone. He helped his girlfriend go around and comfort the younger students who looked afraid."Seriously, you just cause problems wherever you go." Pansy said in disgust. "Now we're prisoners.""Shut up Parkinson." Daphne said, her eyes narrowed."Daphne!" Astoria ran up and threw her arms around her sister. Tabitha was right behind her. "Is that bad man really somewhere in the castle?"Daphne hugged her sister. "He might still be." She admitted and kept her arm around Astoria in order to comfort her."Don't worry Astoria. You're safe here." Draco reassured her."What about Harry?" Astoria asked softly. She gazed at Harry with a worried expression on her face. "Isn't he after you?"Harry exchanged a look with Daphne. "Well, he may be after me." He said reluctantly. He didn't want Astoria to be scared for him."Mr. Potter will be safe as long as he adheres to the rules."Snape had entered the room and was surveying his students. "Miss. Rowstock, Mr. Montague, please make sure all the students are in here and not in their dorms. I want everyone present."Snape looked at Harry. "Are you doing okay?" He asked quietly."Yeah, it's just…how did he get in the castle?" Harry asked. "I thought the Dementors were here to stop him from doing that.""I don't know." Snape answered in frustration. "He should not have been able to step one foot inside this castle."Once everyone had gathered Snape addressed his students. "In the unlikely event that you have not heard, escaped murderer Sirius Black has been seen this evening in Hogwarts."Murmuring broke out among some of the students but they quickly quieted down at the stern look on Snape's face. "In order for the castle to be thoroughly searched tonight, all students will be sleeping in the Great Hall. There will be sleeping bags provided. Tomorrow morning you will be able to return to the dungeons." Snape gave them all a serious look. "Curfew for all students is now seven o'clock. You will also not travel in the castle alone. I want you in groups as you go to classes and meals. During the day you will continue to be in groups during your free time. If you need to go to the library and do not have anyone to go with a Prefect or Head boy or Head girl will accompany you."Groans and protests broke out and Snape only endured it for a moment. "Enough! You will follow these restrictions without fuss! I expect to be obeyed and will be extremely displeased if I find out any of you have gone off on your own or are out past curfew." He glared at them until he was satisfied that they understood how serious he was. "Get ready to head to the Great Hall for bed. You have ten minutes."Snape stopped Harry before he could go to his dorm. "As serious as I am about these regulations for all of my students I am more so for you. No roaming the castle at night like you have done for the past two years.""I haven't done that at all this year." Harry pointed out in a hurt voice."I realize that. I am simply clarifying." Snape returned smoothly. "You are Black's target. Nothing can be worth jeopardizing your safety.""I know. I'll be careful." Harry shook his head. "I can't believe he got into the castle. I could have so easily been there when he showed up."Snape took a deep breath. The same thought had crossed his mind. "It would seem being sorted into Slytherin has helped you more than once."Harry looked at him in confusion. "Huh?""So eloquent." Snape smirked. "I do believe your grades have never been better.""Oh. Well, yeah. They have been." Harry admitted. He grinned a little. "See, I have heard that my new Head of House can get pretty upset if one of his own students doesn't give their best at their schoolwork."Snape fought a grin of his own. "Indeed."HPHPPHPHalf an hour later all the students were gathered in the Great Hall and in their sleeping bags. The Prefects, Madame Pomfrey and Hagrid stood guard in the room while the rest of the staff went in search for Sirius Black. Harry tried to fall asleep but he couldn't. He hated feeling like the threat of Sirius Black was his fault. Everyone had to be extra careful because a maniac was after him. Harry tossed and turned but could not sleep. His mind kept wondering how Black got into the castle. If the Dementors couldn't stop him, Harry wondered if they would be sent back to Azkaban. He hoped so.Harry shut his eyes when he heard footsteps come near him and the voice of Percy Weasley. "Did you find him Professors'?""No. There is no sign of him. I am confident that he is not in the castle anymore." Dumbledore said with a sigh."He should never have been able to get into this castle to begin with!" Snape said darkly."How did he get in?" Percy asked in a loud whisper."We do not know." Dumbledore answered. "Thank you for helping to keep watch Percy, you must be tired. Go on to bed now.""Yes sir. Goodnight." Percy sounded a bit disappointed but walked away."It is interesting that Black was able to get in here undetected. It is almost as if someone is…helping him." Snape said slowly with a trace of sarcasm."Severus." Dumbledore sighed. "I know what you are alluding to and I do not think Sirius had any help getting into this castle.""You know of my concerns in this issue Headmaster." Severus said stiffly. "He could very well be getting help from-""I trust everyone on staff Severus." Dumbledore interrupted. "You must as well or else or you would not have suggested the lessons."Snape gave a harsh laugh. "I don't believe Harry is in any immediate danger from that one Albus. But that does not mean-""I trust everyone on staff." Dumbledore repeated. "And I trust that you are keeping Harry safe."Snape huffed in annoyance. "I am doing my best of course. I am not prepared to let anything happen to my soon-to-be-ward."Harry's mouth curved into a smile. Soon he would never have to think of the Dursley's again and would have a real guardian. One who would protect him unlike the Dursley's who would leave him out in the open with a large bow and a come get me sign for Sirius Black to find. He did wonder about Snape's concern. It sounded like he thought a person on staff had helped Sirius Black into the castle. From what Dumbledore said about his lessons that could only mean Professor Lupin. Not that that made any sense to Harry. Professor Lupin had been best friends with his parents so there was no way he would help Black into the castle to hurt the son of his best friend. Although with Harry's history with DADA professors…perhaps it was something to look into.HPHPHPHP"All righ' everyone, step closer. I have an exciting new creature to show yeh!" Hagrid said jovially, gesturing for everyone to step forward."Better not be another book that bites us." Pansy grumbled.Harry shot her a glare and smiled encouragingly at Hagrid. He had to admit he was a little nervous at whatever Hagrid had in store for them as Hagrid tended to favor some….interesting creatures. Fluffy came to mind and Harry shuddered a bit."Something wrong?" Daphne asked."No. Just wondering what is in store for us today." Harry laughed.Daphne grinned. "At least this class is never boring." She joked."That's for sure. If I get eaten, my father will be very displeased." Draco said, looking at Hagrid suspiciously as he seemed to be trying to coax something out of the Forbidden Forest.Theo snorted. "Dear Mr. Malfoy, we regret to inform you that your son has been eaten by an exotic flobberworm."Draco shot him a dirty look as his friends snickered."Who here has heard of a Hippogriff?" Hagrid asked the class.Hermione raised her hand. "A Hippogriff is a magical creature whose body resembles a winged horse with the upper head and body of an eagle.""Very good Hermione! Five points to Gryffindor." Hagrid beamed. "Now, hippogriffs are easily offended. Yeh never want to insult one 'cause it may be the last thing you do." He made a noise and a hippogriff walked out."Wow." Daphne whispered."Cool!" Draco breathed."This is Buckbeak. Hippogriffs are very proud so you want to be very polite when you meet one. The hippogriff has ter make the firs' move. When yeh walk towards him, yeh bow and wait. If he bows his head back then yer allowed to touch him." Hagrid told them. "If he doesn' bow to yeh, then run 'cause those talons hurt." He looked eagerly at his students. "So who would like to try firs'?"The students exchanged uncertain looks with each other, no one wanting to be the first to volunteer. Harry felt bad as Hagrid's face fell so he took a deep breath and stepped forward. "Ah 'Arry! All righ', step a little closer and bow."Harry took a few more steps and stopped as Buckbeak was staring at him with intense orange eyes. Harry bowed and then slowly looked back up. Buckbeak stared for a second and then lowered his head."Wonderful!" Hagrid clapped. "Now yer can stroke him."Harry still felt a little apprehensive but he continued to approach Buckbeak and slowly raised his and to pet the soft gray feathers. "Hi Buckbeak." He said softly, smiling as Buckbeak nuzzled his head into Harry's hand."I've never seen him take to somebody new so fast!" Hagrid grinned and without warning lifted Harry and plopped him on Buckbeak's back. "Now yeh can ride him!"Before Harry could respond Buckbeak took off in a run and then soared into the air. Harry clutched Buckbeak's feathers in alarm at first but then relaxed as they began flying over the lake. It was like being on his broom! Harry laughed, loving the feel of the wind on his face and he stretched out his arms. It felt like he was truly flying! Buckbeak lowered and dragged his talons in the water. Harry let out a whoop as Buckbeak responded to Hagrid's call and flew them back to the class.Harry slid off and grinned at Hagrid. "That was brilliant!" He pet Buckbeak on the head. "Thanks Buckbeak!""Good boy Buckbeak!" Hagrid went to get a treat for the magical creature.Blaise stepped forward with a sneer on his face. "You're not all that are you? He looks like a bloody chicken!" He stalked to Buckbeak and roughly grabbed him. "Stupid bird.""Don't do that!" Hermione called out in alarm."Blaise back off!" Harry said angrily."Stop!" Hagrid yelled when he saw what Blaise was doing.Buckbeak suddenly reared up on his hind legs and screeched, crashing down into Blaise. "Ow!" Blaise fell down and clutched his arm. Hagrid hastily threw dead ferrets for Buckbeak to go after."Hagrid he needs to go to the infirmary!" Hermione pointed to where Blaise was holding his bleeding arm.Hagrid scooped up Blaise who was moaning. "He killed me! He killed me! Just wait until my parents hear about this!""Class dismissed!" Hagrid called over his shoulder and hurried towards the castle with Blaise who was still yelling about telling his parents.Harry watched them go with a feeling of apprehension. He didn't have a good feeling for Hagrid. Or for Buckbeak.TBC: out of curiosity and for another story I am working on, who is your favorite pairing for Harry? I was never 100 percent behind him and Ginny but sometimes I like her so I was wondering what your thoughts were…

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for all the reviews and encouragement! I really do appreciate the time you take to review! =)"Hagrid should be fired!" Pansy exclaimed."It was Blaise's own fault!" Draco argued."Hagrid told us how to approach Buckbeak and he didn't listen." Harry added."We shouldn't be studying such a dangerous creature anyway!" Pansy shot back. She began walking to the castle. "I'm going to check on Blaise.""Blaise really is an idiot." Theo commented as they watched her stalk off."His parents could make trouble if he complains to them." Daphne sighed.Harry shrugged. "It's not like there isn't a ton of eyewitness's who saw him disregard Hagrid's instructions.""Blaise is such a baby. Did you see his arm? It was just a scratch." Tracey rolled her eyes.Draco rubbed his hands together. "Well, as we have a free period now…Quidditch anyone?""I'm in!" Ron said eagerly. He looked at Harry. "We can use Fred and George's brooms."Hermione frowned. "You should ask permission first.""Fred and George won't mind." Ron said with a dismissive wave of his hand."No, I mean to use the Quidditch pitch. With the new rules and everything we should ask a teacher." Hermione specified."No problem, we can ask Hagrid." Theo pointed to where Hagrid was walking back towards them."Yer still here?" Hagrid asked in surprise. The rest of the class had taken off already."How is Blaise?" Hermione asked curiously.Hagrid sighed. "Madame Pomfrey said he would be fine. It was jus' a scratch but Blaise is kicking up a fuss.""Don't worry. It was his own fault; he was warned not to provoke Buckbeak." Harry said in a comforting tone."Um, Professor? We wanted to go flying since we have free time." Theo said. "Is that okay?""Oh sure! I'll keep an eye on yer' all." Hagrid said, smiling at his remaining students. "Get yer brooms and I'll wait for yer on the pitch. Stay together now.""Thanks Hagrid!" Harry and his friends headed towards the castle to get their gear. When they got to the pitch Harry, Draco, Theo, Ron and Daphne immediately got on their brooms and began playing. Hermione and Tracey were not a fan of flying so they sat in the stands and watched.They were playing with the school's practice snitch and Harry was speeding towards it as it flew to the ground. He could vaguely hear shouts of alarm but ignored it and just before making contact with the grass he caught the snitch and zoomed his broom upward, just in time."Brilliant!""Awesome!""You could have been a splatter on the ground you prat!"Harry snickered at Daphne's admonishment. He had done that move before so he was pretty confident that he wouldn't end up eating grass."Have you lost all sense Potter!"Harry looked up and gulped. Snape was standing at the edge of the pitch with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face. He flew over to him and landed smoothly in front of his soon to be guardian. "Hi Professor.""Hi Professor." Snape mimicked. "What do you think you are doing? Why are you not in class? Doing risky moves like that without proper supervision is not wise Harry!""I'm not alone." Harry protested, gesturing to his friends who were coming towards them, apprehensive looks on their faces. "And Hagrid is supervising us."Snape raised an eyebrow and gave a pointed look to where Hagrid was throwing dead ferrets to Buckbeak; his back turned to the pitch."Um…" Harry bit his lip.Snape rolled his eyes. "Wonderful supervision. You may as well have a first year watching over you.""Hagrid trusts us." Harry defended his friend. "And he would have heard us yell for help if we needed it.""I take it class was canceled after Mr. Zabini was attacked?" Snape asked with a sigh."He was only attacked because he is an idiot." Harry said bluntly."We were all told how to approach Buckbeak safely and Blaise ignored all of Professor Hagrid's instructions." Daphne told Snape.Snape frowned. "He is insisting on contacting his parents after being attacked by the hippogriff." He told them, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. In his opinion, Zabini was simply being a spoiled little brat."What will happen to Hagrid and Buckbeak? It wasn't Buckbeak's fault, I was able to approach him and even ride him." Harry said, glancing over to where Hagrid was still playing with the hippogriff.Snape paled slightly. "You rode the creature? You rode him on your first day of learning about hippogriffs?" He glared in the direction of Hagrid."It was great! It almost felt like I was flying on my own!" Harry enthused, not noticing the look Snape was sending in Hagrid's direction.Snape's glare softened a little at the happy and carefree look on Harry's face. There was a time when he would have been more than happy to wipe that cheerful look off of the child's face but now…"Well you've all had your fun." Snape said in a firm voice. "It is almost time for lunch. Stay together as you head back into the castle." He watched them safely enter the front doors and then went to talk to Hagrid to get his version of Zabini's attack.HPHPHPHPDuring Potion's class Blaise walked in with his arm in a sling moaning about the pain he was in. Pansy kept cooing over him and talking badly of Hagrid in a loud voice.Harry felt his hands clench into fists as he watched Blaise's fake hurt act. There was no way he was in pain from a scratch that surely had been healed by Pomfrey."I only hope I am able to have full use of my arm soon." Blaise said sadly. "How am I going to chop up my ingredients?""I'll help you." Pansy said in a simpering voice. "That joke of a Professor should never have had that dangerous creature!""Buckbeak is not dangerous!" Harry said, standing up angrily. "If you had followed Hagrid's instructions-""Hagrid is a moron and when my parents hear about what happened he will most likely be fired and that stupid animal destroyed." Blaise said nastily."You're pathetic." Harry said in disgust."And you're the boy-who-should-have-died!" Blaise returned heatedly.The classroom door slammed shut and Professor Snape advanced on Blaise. "Mr. Zabini. Is there a reason for you abominable behavior?" He asked in a threatening voice.Blaise paled a bit. "Sir, Potter keeps sticking up for that stupid bird! Look what Buckbeat did to me!" He held up his arm."It's Buckbeak you dunderhead." Draco snickered."I do wonder Mr. Zabini why you are wearing that arm sling when Madame Pomfrey told me your little scratch was completely healed." Snape stared down Blaise. Now that he did not have to spy, he didn't have to pretend to favor any of his Slytherin students and could now call them out when they behaved badly.Blaise flushed. "It was still hurting so I thought…""Take off the sling and stop wasting everyone's time." Snape snapped as he walked up to his desk and began writing on the board. "You will also see me after class."Blaise's face was red as he removed his sling to show an unscratched arm. He sat down and crossed his arms across his chest, sulking.Harry shared a grin with his friends and then began taking notes on Snape's lecture. "The Girding Potion is used to increase one's endurance which can last a number of weeks. A word of warning, if you experiment with this potion the maximum dosage is no more than two of the vials. The color when you are finished should be golden. The ingredients are on the board. Begin now."Daphne began setting up while Harry went to get the ingredients they needed. "When is your next lesson with Professor Lupin?" Daphne asked as she added a set of fairy wings to the cauldron.Harry adjusted the heat until the potion turned turquoise. "I'm not sure. I was going to ask in our last Defense class but Professor Lupin seemed tired, like he might be sick or something. I was the last one to leave and Snape came in and handed him a potion of some sort.""Oh. Maybe a pepper-up or something." Daphne said as she stirred. "I'm sure he will feel better soon.""I hope so. I need more practice." Harry said, suppressing a shiver as he thought about the Dementors. A game against Ravenclaw was coming up and he wanted to be ready, just in case. He didn't want to fail his team again.HPHPHPHPProfessor Lupin wasn't in Defense the next class; instead they had Professor Snape as a substitute. He appeared a little upset and assigned them an essay on werewolves which Hermione had protested."Sir, we are not supposed to study werewolves yet." Hermione called out."When did she get here?" Ron asked in an exasperated tone.Harry frowned. He didn't remember seeing her earlier either."You were not called on therefore you will not speak. Do it again and I will take points." Snape said shortly.Hermione's face fell and Harry couldn't help but shoot a glare at Snape. Snape matched his glare with a fierce one of his own and Harry rolled his eyes and looked away."Who knows what an animagus is and how it differs from a werewolf?" Snape asked the class.Hermione's hand shot up but Snape ignored her and looked at the rest of the class. "No one knows? Pity, it doesn't seem as if Professor Lupin is doing his job."Harry opened his mouth to object but Draco shook his head at him. Harry raised his hand instead."Mr. Potter? Do you have an answer for us?" Snape asked with some surprise."No. But clearly Hermione knows the answer; it seems a pity not to ask her." Harry couldn't help but grin as he said the same thing he had in his first Potion's class when Snape kept asking him questions he didn't know the answers to.Snape narrowed his eyes but after seeing the humor in Harry's, he smirked as he too remembered that first lesson. "I should take points for your cheek Mr. Potter but I will be lenient this once. Miss. Granger, go ahead and answer the question.""An Animagus is a person who can change into an animal whenever they please. Werewolves, who are made when they are bitten by another werewolf, can only transform into a wolf at the full moon." Hermione said as she tried to hide her surprise that Snape was letting her answer.Snape nodded reluctantly. "Correct. Five points to Gryffindor." He had a pained look on his face as he said it.Harry couldn't stop the huge smile on his face when Snape actually gave points to Hermione. His smile faded however when throughout the class, Snape ended up taking ten points from other Gryffindor students. He lingered when class was dismissed after being assigned an essay on werewolves.Snape raised an eyebrow. "Yes?" He asked innocently.Harry threw up his hands. "Why do you do that? You ask questions about something we haven't studied yet and when Hermione knows the answer you ignore her.""I do believe I awarded Miss. Granger five points for her correct answer." Snape pointed out smugly."Yeah but made sure double that was lost during class." Harry huffed. "Why do you do that?""Habit." Snape gathered his papers from Lupin's desk. "If Miss. Granger could know the answers to my questions then there is no reason anyone else couldn't.""I guess." Harry muttered though he doubted anyone else read a year ahead like Hermione did. "How sick is Professor Lupin? I was hoping for another lesson on learning the Patronus.""He should be fine by Saturday. If not I can give you your lesson." Snape answered. "It probably works out best for you to have your lesson then anyway.""Why?" Harry asked but he knew the answer instantly. "Oh. Because of Hogsmeade."Snape nodded. "It will distract you while your friends are gone." He hesitated. "I should be getting the guardianship sorted out sometime this week." He said in a more soft voice.Harry brightened. "I haven't scared you off yet?" He joked."Please. It takes more than one teenager to scare me." Snape said as if offended. He tilted his head as if in thought. "Well…"Harry laughed. "I'll do my best not to completely terrify you." He offered."How generous." Snape said with a ghost of a smile. "Now off with you. And remember what I said about not eating-""More desserts than actual food." Harry finished."Disrespectful brat." Snape muttered as Harry ran off laughing. There was amusement in his voice and he couldn't help but wonder how things had changed so fast.HPHPHPHP When Saturday came around Harry did his best not to show his disappointment at not going to Hogsmeade with his friends. He didn't want to make them feel like they couldn't show their excitement so he nodded and smiled as everyone began discussing what shop to go to first."Remember Draco you promised to bring us back stuff." Astoria and Tabitha kept reminding the blonde."I know." Draco said in a resigned expression. "I will, don't worry."Astoria looked satisfied and went off with Tabitha."You guys have a good time. I'm going to go see if Professor Lupin is feeling better to give me a lesson." Harry told his friends. He smiled and thanked them when they offered to bring him back sweets from Honeydukes.He left the common room and began making his way to the Defense classroom when a noise made him stop."Psst"Harry looked around. "Who's there?" Most of the upper years had already left for Hogsmeade.Fred and George Weasley stepped out of the shadows with identical grins on their faces. "If it isn't our most favorite Slytherin." Fred said."Our only favorite Slytherin." George joked.Harry rolled his eyes and laughed. "What's up?""We know you aren't able to go to Hogsmeade today." George began."And we wondered if you were going to try and sneak out." Fred added.Harry shook his head. "I thought about using my cloak." He admitted. "But I'd probably get caught." Never mind that if he did in fact get caught, Snape would kill him."We have something-""That could make sure you never get caught."Harry stared at the blank parchment George was holding out. "Gee guys, this looks great." He said dryly. "Thanks."George snorted. "This, Harry, is the secret to our success."Fred pointed his wand towards the parchment. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."Harry watched in fascination as words began to appear. Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot  Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's Map.Fred unfolded the parchment and Harry's eyes widened. It was a map of the entire school. "It shows everyone's names and where they are!" Harry exclaimed incredulously. This could have been very helpful in the past to when a Professor or Filch was close by."It shows every classroom and hallway as well as the grounds. The best thing though is that it identifies each person as well as all the secret passages that are hidden in the castle." George told him. "We nicked it from Filch first year." The twins looked very proud of this."We owe the Marauders so much." Fred nodded. "Whoever they are.""May I direct your attention to this particular passageway? Beneath the one-eyed witch statue near the stairs to the Defense classroom is a passage that leads directly to the cellar of Honeydukes. The password is Dissendium." George pointed it out on the map. "It's one of the many that the Professor's do not know about. These are the four that Filch knows about so that is where your cloak will come in handy.""And the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor is caved in. It also led to Hogsmeade." Fred told him.Harry couldn't take his eyes off the map. It was amazing. He could even see where the Headmaster was. "It looks like Dumbledore is pacing in his office." He commented."He does that a lot." Fred responded.George handed the map to Harry. "We are passing this down to you.""We have it memorized anyway." Fred snickered. He pointed his wand at the map. "To clear it again all you have to say is Mischief Managed." The parchment immediately cleared.Harry grinned as he took the parchment. Between this and his cloak he would be able to go anywhere! "Thanks guys!""So how is it going in Slytherin?" George asked seriously. "It looks like you've made some friends."Harry nodded. "Yeah I have. Even Malfoy isn't so bad once you get to know him.""Shocking but we'll believe you." George laughed."Daphne Greengrass is really pretty." Fred grinned when Harry blushed."She's a friend like Hermione is." Harry insisted. He felt mortified as his face grew hotter.George patted Harry on the back. "Sure Harry. It's just our poor Ginny will be devastated."Harry scowled at their teasing as they walked away laughing. He knew that last year Ginny had had a little crush on him but he was sure she was over that. As for Daphne, well, Harry really did like her. She seemed to understand him. And she was really pretty. Harry glanced at the parchment in his hands. He wondered who the marauders had been. Between this map and his invisibility cloak he was sure he would be able to sneak into Hogsmeade and meet up with his friends. He just wondered how his friends would react. With Sirius Black out there he could imagine Hermione being worried about it and Daphne as well. He also really didn't want to upset Snape. In the past he wouldn't have cared but after everything Snape was doing for him, becoming his guardian for Merlin's sake, he couldn't really bring himself to deliberately disobey the man. But it sure was tempting. It couldn't hurt just to go and see Hogsmeade for a little while. He could stay under his cloak and then his friends wouldn't even know. Weighing the options in his mind he hurried to the Slytherin common room where the third years and up were already gone. He went to his dorm and took out his cloak. He stuffed it in his pocket and went to leave only to be stopped by Astoria and Tabitha."Hey Harry since you can't go to Hogsmeade either do you want to play gobstones with us?" Astoria asked hopefully.Harry hesitated. "I'm, um, going to see Professor Lupin. Maybe later?"Astoria looked disappointed but nodded. "Okay."Harry continued on his way and once he was alone in the hallway he took out his cloak. He said the incantation for the map and was about to put the cloak on when he heard someone clear their throat behind him. Harry swirled around and his eyes connected with accusing blue ones."What do you think you are doing?" Daphne asked her hands on her hips. Her eyes fell suspiciously on his cloak and map.Harry sighed. Even with an invisibility cloak and a secret map of the castle he still got caught. And he had a feeling that Daphne wouldn't think his idea to sneak into Hogsmeade was as brilliant as he thought it was.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: I forgot to thank everyone for their ideas on who Harry should be paired with. It wasn't for this story that I was asking but another story I am working on where Harry is sixteen. In this story Harry is only thirteen and while he may develop a crush, he's too young to fall in love…at least in my opinion lol"Well?" Daphne demanded."Um, I was just going to…uh" Harry scrambled to think of something but he didn't need to."You were going to sneak to Hogsmeade." Daphne sighed. She shook her head. "Do you know how much trouble you could get into if you do that? Or how much danger? What if something happened to you in Hogsmeade yet everyone thought you were safe here in the castle?"Harry was quiet for a moment. He hadn't thought of that. "It was a stupid idea." He said finally. "I just wanted to feel normal for once and experience Hogsmeade with everyone else.""Yeah, I know." Daphne said softly."Wait, why aren't you at Hogsmeade?" Harry asked curiously.Daphne shrugged. "I felt bad for you." She admitted. "I've been to Hogsmeade before with my parents so it's not something new for me.""But its different going with your friends isn't it?" Harry pointed out. He couldn't help but feel touched that she had stayed behind for him."It's no big deal. I'll go next time, as will you hopefully." Daphne said. She stared at him. "Unless you are still going to sneak out?" She asked hesitantly."No, I'm caught." Harry laughed. "I'll stay."Daphne looked relieved. "Good. So what do you want to do?"Harry looked at the map and handed it to her. "Do you want to explore the castle?"Daphne's eyes widened as she looked the map over. "This is amazing! Where did you get it?""A friend." Harry answered. Or two, he mentally added. "So what do you say?""Are you kidding? Definitely yes!" Daphne said excitedly. "Where should we start?""There is one on the fourth floor behind the mirror but apparently it's caved in. I was still going to look at it though." Harry said as he took the map back and studied it."Let's go!"They threw the cloak on themselves just in case and made their way to the fourth floor. Once they found the mirror Harry whispered "Dissendium." The mirror moved down and revealed a small opening but after casting Lumos Harry and Daphne could see that it was filled with stones. "Too bad. What a waste of a good passageway." Harry said with a sigh. After a moment the mirror moved back to where it had been."There is another one beneath the Whomping Willow although I don't really want another run in with that particular tree." Harry made a face.Daphne looked confused for a moment before she smiled slowly. "Oh. The flying car incident.""The flying car catastrophe is more like it." Harry said ruefully. "It seemed brilliant at the time though but wasn't worth almost getting expelled over.""Hmm how many times have you almost been expelled now?" Daphne teased."Too many to count?" Harry grinned. "All threats were by Professor Snape, ironically enough.""What is going on with the guardianship? It's still happening right?" Daphne asked in a whisper as they passed Filch who was mopping the corridor.Once they were safely past the grumpy caretaker Harry threw the cloak off of them and studied the map again. "Yes. Professor Snape said it would probably happen sometime this week. He's just waiting for the official papers and then he has to get the Dursley's to sign it." His emerald eyes met her sapphire blue ones. "I never want to see them again but I have to admit I wouldn't mind being a fly on the wall when they face Snape."Daphne laughed. "Me too. They deserve to be in Azkaban if you ask me.""Snape said I could press charges but I said no. If I did that then the truth would come out for everyone to know. I get enough unwanted attention as it is." Harry shrugged."I can understand that." Daphne said gently. Wanting to cheer him up she took the map from him and changed the subject. "The one-eyed witch is a passageway?""That's the one I was going to use to get into Honeydukes." Harry replied."Well…we can go look at it at least." Daphne said with a grin. "As long as we don't use it…"They hurried towards the Defense classroom until they came beside the one-eyed statue. "Dissendium." Harry incanted. Harry and Daphne both watched in fascination as the hump on the statue's back opened to reveal a short slide into a tunnel."Bloody brilliant." Harry breathed."Hmm even if it isn't safe to use this now it definitely has possibilities." Daphne remarked, eyeing the passageway with interest. When Harry looked at her in amazement she shrugged. "I'm not a complete goody-goody you know."Harry laughed and they watched as the statue closed back up. "Yeah, I know Greengrass." He glanced back at the map and noticed an unfamiliar name headed towards out of the castle.Daphne playfully slugged him on the shoulder. "Whatever Potter."They were busy laughing and Harry forgot about the name on the map. They didn't notice Professor Lupin come up behind them. "Excuse me you two but what are you doing?"Professor Lupin eyed the statue first and then his eyes landed on Harry and Daphne suspiciously. When he saw the map in Harry's hand he immediately grabbed it. "What are you doing with this?" He asked harshly.Harry watched in shock when Professor Lupin knew how to erase the map. "Yes, I know what this is. And if it fell into the wrong hands it can be quite dangerous."Harry felt guilty and exchanged a look with Daphne who looked like she felt guilty too. "We were just using the map to explore." Harry said softly."As I said this could be very dangerous. What if Sirius Black got a hold of it? He would know exactly where you are at every minute of the day!" Remus said in a strict voice. "Harry, your parents sacrificed themselves to protect you so that you could live. Being this irresponsible with your safety is a poor way to repay them."Harry sucked in his breath at that.Daphne frowned. "Professor Lupin-"Remus rubbed his hand over his face. "Professor Snape told me you were planning to come for a lesson so I've been looking for you." He said more softly."I was but-" Harry started.Remus once again interrupted. "I don't know how this came to be in your hands but I will be confiscating it. Now, I will take you to Professor Snape."Harry and Daphne silently followed their irate Professor to Snape's office. When Snape opened the door he looked surprised. "What is wrong?""I found them wandering the castle. I did not think that was safe as we do not know if Sirius Black can get back in." Remus informed him."Miss. Greengrass why are you not in Hogsmeade?" Snape asked."I wanted to keep Harry company sir." Daphne answered. "I've been there before and I didn't think it would be a big deal if I stayed here.""It's not but you should have let me know. I like to know where my Slytherins are as you both know. And Harry, I had thought you were going to have your Patronus lesson today." Snape raised an eyebrow in question."I was but then I bumped into Daphne and we decided to explore the castle a bit." Harry mumbled.Snape's dark eyes landed on the blank map in Remus's hands. "What is that?"Remus gave a loud nervous laugh. "This? It's just a spare bit of parchment." He slipped the map into his pocket."Then it is nothing to howl with laughter about is it?" Snape gave a wave of his hand. "Thank you for delivering my Slytherins, you may go."Remus nodded and turned to leave. He glanced at Harry, his eyes kinder than they had been just a few minutes earlier. "If you still want to have a lesson, I'll be in my classroom the rest of the afternoon.""Thank you Professor." Harry gave a small smile."Sit down." Snape said to them curtly. He leaned against his desk regarding them thoughtfully. "Were you trying to sneak into Hogsmeade?" He asked finally."No." Harry answered automatically. He didn't need to mention that he almost had done just that. "We were using my cloak to explore the castle." Being halfway honest couldn't hurt. If Professor Lupin didn't feel the need to mention the map then Harry figured it wasn't important enough to mention."Miss. Greengrass, is there a reason you did not inform me that you were staying in the castle?" Snape asked with a raised eyebrow."I was going to but then I ran into Harry and I forgot. I'm sorry sir." Daphne said softly."You both know the danger that is out there and the safety precautions we are trying to take." Snape said slowly. "Hogsmeade weekend was very close to being cancelled as it is. Even if Harry was not there no one would put it past Black to harm any of the students. This is a man who betrayed his friends and killed thirteen people with one curse."Harry stared at Snape wide-eyed. "Thirteen people with one curse?"Snape nodded. "Yes. Someone who could do that would think nothing of killing students in order to get what he wants.""Didn't Sirius Black go to Hogwarts?" Daphne asked curiously. "I think I heard that from my Mum. It was something of a scandal because he didn't end up in the house the rest of his family had been in.""That happens though doesn't it? The Patil twins ended up in different houses." Harry pointed out."It happens but it is rare." Snape answered. "And yes, Black ended up in Gryffindor while the rest of his family was in Slytherin. Despite being placed in a house known for bravery and chivalry he showed at a young age that he was capable of murder.""Was he in school when you were?" Harry asked with surprise. "Did he know my parents?"Snape stared at him for a moment. "Yes. He was in the same year as your parents and I.""Oh." Why hadn't Harry been told this piece of news? "Wait." Snape had said Sirius had betrayed his friends. Harry stood up. "Was he friends with my parents?" He demanded loudly."Control yourself and sit down." Snape warned him."No! Was he friends with my parents? Did he betray them to Voldemort?" He ignored the wince from both Daphne and Snape when he said the monsters name. "Was he?""I told you to sit down." Snape said in a firm voice. "Watch how you speak to me Harry even if you are upset." He warned. He may have gone a bit softer as far as Harry was concerned but that did not mean he would tolerate disrespect."I just want to know the truth." Harry sat down. "Please?"Snape debated on how much to tell the boy. Harry didn't need any more upset in his life; he had enough to deal with as it was. "Yes he was a friend of your father's." He admitted. "And later a friend of your mother's.""He betrayed them?" Harry whispered. "He got them killed?"Snape shut his eyes for a moment and then nodded. "Yes." He decided not to tell Harry about Black being his godfather just yet. Harry looked like he had reached his limit as it was."And no one thought to tell me this?" Harry stood up again and scowled at Snape. "No one thought it was important for me to know?""Harry calm down. How could have knowing helped anything?" Daphne tried to reason with him.Harry threw up his hands. "It makes more sense as to why he is after me! He got my parents killed and wants to finish his work by killing me too!" Harry almost yelled."Miss. Greengrass you are excused. Go straight to the common room." Snape ordered. "Tell no one of this conversation. Harry will be there shortly."Daphne stood up. "Yes sir." As she past Harry she whispered, "Don't lose your temper. It will be okay."Harry stood there breathing hard. He had though Black was some insane follower of Voldemort who wanted to avenge his master but he had also gotten Harry's parents killed. He was part of the reason Harry had grown up with abusive relatives and had had his heritage held from him."Before we talk more, you will work on clearing your mind." Snape said. He glowered when Harry glared at him. "Do. It. Now."Harry huffed but shut his eyes and tried to clear his mind. "How am I supposed to clear it?" He asked exasperatedly."It is your mind Harry, only you know how it works." Snape said stiffly. He relented after a couple of seconds. "Think of something calming. You like to fly, think about soaring in the air."Harry obeyed and soon his thoughts were of soaring through the air feeling carefree. His breathing immediately slowed down and when he opened his eyes he was feeling calmer. "I'm still upset." He said quietly.Snape nodded. "I know but now we can talk more rationally, yes?"Harry nodded and sat back down."Sirius Black was your parents' friend, your father in particular. They trusted him so much that Black was their secret keeper when they were targeted by the Dark Lord." Snape said slowly, trying to decide on how much to divulge. He knew in time he would need to tell Harry about his own part in his parents' deaths, but he couldn't bring himself to do it yet. He wouldn't blame the child for hating him."They were under the Fidelius Charm and the secret keeper was the only one who knew their location. When the Dark Lord attacked it was obvious that the only person who could have told him where to look was Black. He was later confronted by another friend of your parents named Peter Pettigrew. That was when Black incanted the curse that killed so many, including Pettigrew. All that was left was a finger of Pettigrew's."Harry paled. "Oh." He whispered, feeling sick. And now that crazy man was after him.Snape regarded him with concern and then went to his floo. Harry was too busy thinking about what he had just learned that he only vaguely heard Snape calling for something from the kitchens. Pettigrew. Wait, wasn't that the name he had seen on the…"Here." Snape handed Harry a bottle. Harry took it and read what it was. Butterbeer. He looked up at Snape curiously. "It is a popular drink that your friends are most likely enjoying in Hogsmeade today." He told him.Harry popped the top off and took a cautious sip and then drank more deeply. It was the best drink he had ever tasted, even better than pumpkin juice. It tasted a bit less-sickly sweet than butterscotch and was delicious. He once again forgot about the name on the map. "Wow. This is really good!" He said with a grin.Snape sat down behind his desk. "I thought you would like it. Now, do you remember the deal we made?"Harry was confused for a moment but then it came to him. "You'll tell me about being lab partners with my Mum if I tell you more about my childhood." He said slowly.Snape nodded. "That's right."Harry sighed. "What more can I tell you?""You spent twelve years with them, I'm sure there is plenty more. I know this is difficult to discuss but you can talk to me about anything." Snape said sincerely."Okay. Um, well I had to do pretty much all of the housework and yard work. During the summer they would lock me out of the house until all of the yard work was finished. It was really hot and I didn't get any food or water until after I was done." Harry stared at his bottle of Butterbeer which was halfway finished. "I would usually be really sunburned after. It hurt."Snape kept his anger under control. He wanted Harry to talk about his childhood though Snape hated hearing about how he was treated. It made him sick to think he had thought the boy spoiled and instead he was being hurt for twelve years. "I would imagine it would. Being overheated and dehydrated is quite dangerous.""Yeah, I would feel sick afterwards. But if I complained I got in trouble." Harry murmured."Which would mean you were confined to your cupboard?" Snape asked, already knowing the answer."Yeah." Harry replied. He looked at Snape hopefully. "Now it's your turn right?""It is." Snape wondered where to start. He wasn't sure if he was ready to tell Harry that he had met Lily when they were nine years old. "The potion's Professor I had liked to have students pair with someone from an opposite house. I don't usually do that myself because I do not feel like refereeing during class." Snape smirked a bit. "I was partnered with Lily. We had no problems being of different houses and we both had an interest in the subject. She was so full of creativity and life that she was always able to get me talking which was not an easy feat. I was more of a loner in school and kept to my studies, which I'm sure comes as a great shock to you."Harry suppressed a smile. "Astonishing." He said in a straight voice though his eyes were sparkling with amusement.Snape shook his head a bit yet a slight smile graced his face. "She truly was a natural. She didn't even need to look at the instructions most of the time; the subject came so easily to her. She even was able to add to or enhance the potions especially if she incorporated her charms skills. Charms was her favorite subject, she was easily the best in the class." His eyes had a faraway look to them. "She was very kind. To everyone." He said slowly as he remembered the girl who had stolen his heart. "She thought it was ridiculous that some would act as if you could only be friends with those in your own house. She said she would be friends with whoever she wanted no matter what anyone thought. Lily also saw the unjust treatment Slytherin would receive and that upset her." Snape slowly grinned. "She said what was on her mind and could have a fiery temper when she wanted to. She hated bullies and had no problem calling them out on their behavior."Harry listened and was almost memorized by how his mother was being described. "Aunt Petunia said she was a good for nothing freak." Harry sighed. "She never said anything nice about her own sister. I think that hurt more than their treatment of me you know? The lies they told me about my parents.""As we have discussed, they are deplorable people. The way they treated you, the things they said to you show how sick of human beings they are if you can truly call them human." Snape said in disgust. "Their attitude is all them, not any of it was your fault although they obviously did their best to make you feel that way.""Yeah they did." Harry agreed ruefully."You had mentioned before that you tried to tell the Minister of the treatment you suffered. Had you ever told anyone else?" Snape asked. He was still furious that Cornelius Fudge had ignored that Harry was being abused and sent him back to the Dursley's. How that moron had ever been elected was beyond him.Harry was quiet for a second. "Yes. Once when I was little." He finally admitted. He hated this memory. "My teacher saw a couple of bruises I had and asked me about them. I was young and didn't know what to say so I just said that I had gotten in trouble with my relative's. She called my Aunt who told her that I was a liar and would even cause injuries on myself to get attention. She must have been really convincing because my teacher held me after school and lectured me on what a selfish child I was and how horrid I was to lie about my relative's. Then when I arrived home…" Harry met Snape's eyes, pain clear in his eyes. "I got slapped around a bit and shouted out and then locked in my cupboard for the weekend. They also threatened to drive me somewhere dark and isolated and leave me there if I ever told anyone again. I didn't want to be at that house but I was seven and didn't want to be left alone on the street either."Snape had to look away so that Harry wouldn't be scared by the murderous look he knew he had on his face. Oh, he could not wait to visit the creatures that called themselves the Dursley's. Harry may not want to charge them with abuse, which Snape understood, but that did not mean they would get away with their mistreatment of him. No, they would suffer. And Snape would enjoy every second of it.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for the reviews! They truly make me happy!Harry, Draco and Theo were heading outside for Quidditch practice when the sounds of shouting drew them towards the Gryffindor stairs."He's a murderer and you know it!" Ron was yelling at Hermione. They had a small crowd standing around them, watching in amusement."He is not! He is just misunderstood!" Hermione argued back."Who are they talking about? Sirius Black?" Theo asked in confusion."Crookshanks going after Scabbers is simply a natural behavior for a cat. Besides, I do not believe he killed your rat." Hermione huffed.Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh honestly."Harry walked over to Ron and Hermione. "What's going on?"Ron pointed at Hermione. "Her cat killed Scabbers!""His rat probably ran away from him because he is so maddening!" Hermione said in frustration."He didn't run away! His cage was wrecked and there was blood!" Ron's face was red with anger.Hermione threw her hands up. "You didn't find his body only a few little drops of blood. He probably hurt himself breaking out of his cage.""Say what you will, I know your cat ate him. But of course, Hermione Granger is never wrong!" Ron looked to Harry. "Right Harry?"Harry hesitated. He really did not want to be in the middle of their fight. "Well, we don't know for sure that Crookshanks ate Scabbers-" Harry began."You're on her side?" Ron fumed."No, I'm just saying that we don't know what happened. Maybe Crookshanks did eat Scabbers but-""He did not! And even if he did, Ron hated Scabbers anyway! You were always complaining about him." Hermione interrupted."That doesn't mean I wanted him dead!" Ron shot back. "You just better keep your killer cat away from me or else!""Are you threatening Crookshanks?" Hermione demanded."Let me think." Ron cupped his chin thoughtfully. He then glared at Hermione. "Yes I am!""You stay away from my cat Ronald Weasley. Unless, of course, you want me to hex you with the knee-reversal hex I read about. You wouldn't have much luck ever riding a broom properly again!" Hermione said smugly.Ron opened his mouth but then shut it. "Just keep that fur ball away from me." He turned and walked away."He is unbelievable!" Hermione seethed. She seemed to finally notice the crowd watching and her face turned pink. She glanced at Harry and then hurried away in the opposite direction that Ron went.Harry felt torn. It did sound like Scabbers had been eaten by Crookshanks but Hermione could be right, Scabbers could have run away and cut himself on his cage. He felt bad for both of his friends but he also really didn't want to get in the middle of their argument."Wow." Draco turned to Harry and Theo. "I think I may have lost some brain cells after watching that."Theo snickered. "I think Granger is right. There would have been more evidence if her cat had eaten Weasley's rat. Like parts of the rat left."Draco looked green. "That is disgusting. Can we go to practice now?"Theo cast a tempus. "Blimey, we're late! Let's go!"When they arrived on the pitch, Graham glared at them. "Gee thanks for joining us." He said sarcastically. He waved off their explanations. "Get in the air. Harry, you're using a school broom?"Harry nodded as he lifted up into the air. He missed his Nimbus; it had been so much faster than the school broom he was now using. Draco had already offered to trade brooms during the official game which Harry was happy about. The school brooms were pretty old and had a tendency to swerve on their own or shake when you rode too high.Harry was watching the team practice runs, waiting for Graham to release the practice snitch when he saw something out of the corner of his eye. He turned and sitting near the pitch was a black dog. A black dog that resembled the grim Trelawney had said she had seen in his teacup the first day of class. The same dog he had seen when he had been in the owlery. Harry frowned as he remembered seeing a similar dog in Surrey.Suddenly the snitch flew by him and Harry shot off after it. The broom he was on was a little harder to control and not as smooth to ride but Harry was still able to catch the snitch ahead of Theo who was acting as the opposing seeker. The team played several more runs before Graham finally blew his whistle. Harry flew his broom to the ground with the rest of his teammates."Good job!" Graham nodded as everyone smoothly landed. "We play Ravenclaw in a few days and I think we are ready. From what I have seen though, they have a pretty strong team this year. So the night before make sure you get a good night's sleep and in the morning eat a light yet healthy breakfast.""Don't worry Captain, we'll get our eight hours of beauty sleep and eat our fruits and veggies." Miles Bletchley, one of the chasers, joked."You better. I want to see everyone at their best." Graham responded. "Practice dismissed!"Harry, Draco, and Theo began heading to the locker room to get changed. Harry stopped walking and scanned the grounds, looking for signs of the mysterious dog."What's wrong?" Theo asked."Have you guys seen a dog around here? Besides Fang, I mean?" Harry asked.Draco looked around. "I haven't." He made a face. "Hagrid didn't get another huge slobbering dog did he?""I haven't seen any other dogs either." Theo said. "Why?"Harry gave a shrug. "I thought I saw one. It doesn't matter. Let's go. I have to be at Professor Lupin's office in twenty minutes.""I still wish all of us could learn to cast a Patronus." Draco said as they continued walking. "What form does yours take?"Harry snorted. "No idea. I can't cast a corporeal Patronus yet. I have only cast a non-corporeal one and it took all the strength I had to do it. Hopefully it's enough to keep away a Dementor if one comes around me again.""I doubt the Headmaster will tolerate them crashing a game again." Theo said. "He looked really angry after you, um, fell."Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly. "You can say it. I fainted."Theo shrugged. "Either way, I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will keep them away."Harry hoped so. He was only taking these Patronus lessons as a precaution. He didn't want to be in a situation where he actually needed to use the charm. He had had enough of Dementors to last a lifetime.HPHPHPHP"Hello Harry." Remus smiled when his student entered his office. "Feel ready for another go at your Patronus?"Harry nodded and was relieved to see that Lupin didn't appear to be angry about the whole map incident. "I'm ready. You do have plenty of chocolate on hand though right?"Remus gave a chuckle. "I try to regularly keep some on me at all times." He walked to the trunk which held the boggart and glanced back at Harry. "You have your happy memory?"Harry found himself thinking of several happy memories. It was still when Snape had said he would be his guardian but now he also thought about his new and old friends, exploring the castle with Daphne, Snape talking about his mother…"Expecto Patronum!" He yelled as the boggart turned Dementor came at him. Once again a silvery smoke came out of his wand and he forced the boggart back in his trunk."Excellent! I could almost see a form taking shape that time." Remus beamed.Harry fell into a chair, breathing hard. He took the chocolate offered by his teacher. "Sorry, I'm still tired from practice.""How is it being on the Slytherin team?" Remus asked as he sat down as well. "From what I have heard you were Gryffindors star player. They must miss you.""I miss Gryffindor." Harry admitted. "But I also feel comfortable in Slytherin. And believe me; no one could be more shocked by that than me.""And everyone is nice to you there?" Remus asked curiously.Harry gave a snort of laughter. "No. But not everyone in Gryffindor is nice to me either. I don't think one house can be all good or all bad you know? I mean, Sirius Black was a Gryffindor."Remus looked away. "True." He said finally. He gave a slight shake of his head and relaxed a bit. "So then you feel ready for your upcoming Quidditch game?""Yeah I feel ready, as long as I don't get distracted. Like today I almost missed flying after the snitch because I saw a strange dog on the field. It's weird," Harry said thoughtfully. "It looks like a dog I saw earlier this year as well as in Surrey."Remus paled. Harry didn't notice as he was looking with interest at the lesson plan on Remus's desk. "Do you think it could be a stray?" Harry asked as he finally looked up.Remus had composed his features and simple gave a nod. "Most likely. I would suggest staying away from it if you see it again. In fact, let me know if you do. It probably has owners looking for it."Harry hesitated. "In my Divination class, Trelawney said she saw the grim in my teacup and that it meant someone was after me. And now I am seeing a strange dog that looks like the grim…" He trailed off."Professor Trelawney has been predicting death and doom since before I was a student here. I don't believe her predictions are known for being true." Remus gave him a reassuring smile."She's always predicting my death." Harry grumbled."Perhaps you should have signed up for a course that would have actually taught you something instead of that useless class you did sign up for." A sneering voice said."Severus, come in." Remus said, nodding to what Snape was holding. "Thank you for bringing it."Snape handed him the goblet. "I wouldn't want you forgetting to take it." There was a little bit of sarcasm in his voice.Harry looked curiously at the goblet which was had a light blue smoky look to it. "What is it?""A potion I take to help with a little condition I have." Remus said smoothly. "Professor Snape is kind enough to make it for me."The look on Snape's face was anything but kind. "You best drink it before you go anywhere, say, a stroll in the moonlight perhaps." Snape turned his back on Remus and looked at Harry. "Divination is a waste of time. Professor Trelawney can hardly dress herself properly, never mind actually teach anything. I'm not happy that any of my Slytherins decided to take that course. I doubt you ever had any interest in being a seer, so why are you in that class?"Harry shrugged. "It sounded easy." Oops, that was obviously the wrong thing to say. Snape's eyes narrowed."Well, we wouldn't want you to tax your brain would we?" Snape said caustically. "It's not like you are here to get an actual education."Harry threw him a mild glare. "Why is it offered if it is so useless?""A question I ask the Headmaster every year." Snape rolled his eyes. "If you decide to challenge yourself with a real class, let me know before Christmas break so that I can arrange it.""Like muggle studies?" Harry asked innocently.Remus snorted.Snape narrowed his dark eyes. "A muggle born or in your case, raised, has no need of that class."Harry thought about what Hermione had said. "But to study it from a wizard's point of view-""Spare me." Snape glanced over at the trunk which was shaking due to the boggart trying to get out. "How are the lessons going?""Okay. It's draining though." Harry said ruefully."He is doing very well. He can cast a non-corporeal Patronus which is on its way to being fully corporeal." Remus put in proudly.Snape gave a curt nod to Remus and then turned back to Harry. "Good. I knew you would catch on quickly." He regarded Harry for a second, noting that the child was still pale from facing the boggart and had not eaten any of the bar of chocolate that was in his hand. He sighed and waved his wand and the bar became a mug full of hot chocolate. "Drink up and do not be late for dinner. Is someone coming here to walk with you back to the dungeons?""I can walk him." Remus offered.Snape ignored his colleague and stared at Harry.Harry nodded. "My friends are coming soon."Snape gave a nod of approval and left."It's somewhat odd to see you and Severus getting along." Remus remarked as he sipped at his potion."Why?" Harry asked, thinking Lupin must have heard about the animosity that used to be between him and Snape."Your father couldn't stand him and you look so much like him, well, it is kind of surreal." Remus admitted. "When I think of the pranks that were played…" He shook his head.Harry could only imagine the pranks that were played on his father by Snape. "My Mum got along with Snape." He shrugged."Oh, yes. For most of Hogwarts anyway. That was part of the problem. James liked your mother and was jealous of her friendship with Severus." Remus's eyes had taken a faraway expression as he remembered his school days. "That's why he was so against Severus and always pulling those pranks on him. Well, the pranks were usually Sirius's idea. He hated Slytherin and knew Severus was into the Dark Arts."Harry stiffened as he heard Sirius's name being mentioned. And his dad was the one who was mean to Snape? That couldn't be right. "So what did Snape do to deserve being pranked on?" He asked slowly."They just didn't like him. Peter went along with it too. I felt bad because I just stood there and let it happen." Remus said with regret in his voice. "Some of the pranks were pretty cruel. Severus tried to defend himself but there were four of us so…"Harry stood up so fast that he knocked the chair he had been sitting in over. "You guys ganged up on him? You played cruel pranks on him? No wonder he hated me! I remind him of the boy who obviously bullied him!" Harry felt sick to his stomach at the thought.Remus's eyes widened as he realized he had shared too much and how Harry would interpret it. "Harry, I'm sorry. I got caught up in remembering. Your father was a good person, honest." He said urgently. James had grown up into a fine man and Harry needed to believe that."Does a good person bully someone? Did my dad do that for all of Hogwarts? What kind of pranks were they? And how could you and he have been friends with Sirius Black?" Harry stared at his professor, his eyes hard.Remus stood up. "Harry, please calm down. First, your dad was a good person. He just didn't get along with Severus. And yes, some of the pranks were pretty bad. But he did grow up and mature. Lily wouldn't have fallen in love with him if he hadn't, trust me on that." Remus took a deep breath. "As for Sirius Black, in school he hated the Dark Arts as I said. It was a shock that he turned out to be a supporter of you-know-who. We were all best friends but he and James were like brothers. That's why James named him your godfather, he trusted-""What!" Harry looked at Remus in horror. "That murderer is my godfather? The man who betrayed my parents? The man who is after me now?""I-I thought you knew." Remus looked horrified himself. He hadn't meant to tell Harry any of this; he had just gotten caught up in remembering his friends. He ran his hand through his hair. "Please sit down and let me explain.""What is there to explain? My father was a bully to Snape and I have a godfather who wants to kill me." Harry said flatly. A knock on the door interrupted them."Hey Harry, ready to go?" Theo and Draco poked their heads in the room."I'm ready." Harry said curtly."No Harry. Please stay and talk with me." Remus pleaded. He had to try and fix this."I'm done talking." Harry left the room, his two friends following him with bemused expressions on their faces.HPHPHPHP"Okay what happened?" Draco asked once they had reached the common room."You look furious. Did the lesson go badly?" Theo asked.Daphne and Tracey looked to Harry in concern. The group was sitting in their usual corner of the common room. "Harry what's wrong?" Daphne looked in concern as Harry visibly tried to control his breathing. His face was flushed and his eyes shiny. He wasn't crying but he looked ready to break."How could no one have told me? How could my own father have been a Dudley?" Harry ranted."What's a Dudley?" Tracey whispered to Theo, who shrugged in response."No wonder he hated me at first sight, I look just like that prat." Harry continued, pacing back and forth."Harry, look at me and tell me what's wrong." Daphne said firmly, standing up."Technically besides the Dursley's, this means he is my family. Isn't that sick? I get him and the Dursley's?" Harry began laughing but not in a humorous way."Harry!" Daphne grabbed his face and forced him to look at her. "Please tell us what happened."Harry looked into her concerned eyes and felt himself calm down a bit. "Did any on you know that Sirius Black is my godfather? Or that my own father was a bully when he was in school?"If Harry hadn't been so upset he would have laughed as all four Slytherins mouths dropped open."Black is your godfather?" Theo asked incredulously."I did know he was friends with your father." Draco admitted. "My father mentioned it. I had no idea about him being your godfather though.""Wait, does this mean he has rights to you?" Tracey asked nervously."Of course not. He's an escaped convict." Theo scoffed."It's going to be okay. They will catch Black and you won't have to worry about him anymore." Daphne told Harry. "I can't imagine what a shock that was to hear. And you said something about your father?"Harry looked away. He doubted that Snape would want students to know that he was bullied and pranked in school. And frankly, Harry was embarrassed to have everyone find out his dad had been like that."It's time for dinner." Tracey said softly as she saw the other students begin to head out of the common room."I'm not hungry." Harry said dully. "You guys go ahead.""Come on, you need to eat." Draco said. "Besides, Professor Snape will have a conniption if you miss a meal again."Harry shook his head. "I can't even think of eating right now. I'm just, argh!" He punched the wall in a fit of anger and walked to the other side of the common room which was now empty. He cradled his hand and stared blindly at the wall."Shouldn't we try and help him?" Tracey asked helplessly.Daphne shook her head. "He needs more than us right now." She said softly. She watched Harry sadly. He needed his guardian.TBC: Snape meeting the Dursley's will happen in the next chapter =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thanks again for all the reviews and support of my story! It is very much appreciated! Snape was already sitting at the Head Table when Daphne apprehensively walked up and said she needed to speak with him. After she quietly told him that Harry was in the common room and was extremely upset after his lesson with Lupin to the point of hurting himself, Snape hurried to the dungeons. The only thing he could think of was that Harry had had another memory of his parents' death. When he arrived in the common room, he saw that Harry was slumped on the couch with one of his hands swollen and bruised. His eyes were red yet there were no tears."What has happened Harry?" Snape asked as he stepped closer and gently lifted Harry's hurt hand to examine it."Um, I punched a wall." Harry said, wincing slightly as Snape checked his hand for fractures."I see. And what was the wall doing that it would deserve to be punched?" Snape asked before he began chanting a healing spell over the injured hand. The swelling immediately went down and he summoned a bruise balm from his office. Once it flew into his hand he carefully rubbed some of the balm on and the bruises began to fade."Nothing. I'm just mad." Harry shrugged, shaking his hand a little to test that it didn't hurt anymore. "Thank you." He mumbled.Snape straightened and regarded the child for a moment. "You are welcome. However, I would rather you thank me by not hurting yourself again, angry or not. Am I clear?"Harry nodded. "Yes sir.""What happened in Lupin's lesson?" Snape asked."He told me…how my father treated you in school. And that Sirius Black is my godfather." Harry said miserably.Snape was torn for a second between comforting his soon-to-be-ward and killing that blasted wolf. He wavered for a moment and then sat down next to Harry. "He should not have told you any of that." He said in a firm voice. "Exactly what did he tell you?""He mentioned the pranks they played on you in school." Harry said and disgust was clear in his voice. "He said it was mostly Sirius Black and my Dad and that Peter Pettigrew and he just followed along. He said the pranks were cruel." Harry lifted his sorrowful eyes up at his professor. "I always thought my Dad was the good guy and that you probably started any fights between the two of you. I didn't know he was like my cousin who bullied me all the time. I'm so sorry."Snape took a deep breath as he struggled to think on what to say. "Your father and his friends and I did not like each other. And while I was subject to their…pranks, I gave as good as I got.""I know what it is like to be singled out and bullied. He was obviously a jerk. I don't blame you for hating me." Harry shook his head."I do not hate you and I have not hated you. I told you this already." Snape said a touch of impatience. "I was unkind to you because of your father. I thought you would be just like him and I was wrong. If you are like anyone, it is your mother. Now while it is true that I did not like James Potter, I am aware of the fact that he died trying to save his family. Do not lose sight of that simply because of his treatment of me."Harry was silent. He knew his father had died for him but he couldn't help but feel let down. Everyone had said how well liked his dad had been and how much Harry was like him. Even Snape had until now. Now Snape thought he was more like his mother. "I guess I'm just disappointed in my Dad. I hate that he was like that, you know?""I know." Snape said quietly. "Now about the other issue Professor Lupin brought up-""Yeah, how could no one have told me that I had a godfather? And that it is Sirius Black?" Harry demanded."How would it have helped you to know that?" Snape responded. "You've been through enough this year Harry. I did plan to tell you eventually but why would I want to add to the pain and changes you have had already this year?""I deserved to know." Harry insisted stubbornly."Yes." Snape agreed. He smirked to himself at the surprised look on Harry's face."Will it make it easier for Black to get me? I mean, since he is my godfather?" Harry asked uneasily."No." Snape said firmly. "He has no rights over you. He is an escaped convict; he can't exactly go to the ministry and file for guardianship. He will not get to you Harry. I will protect you make no mistake about that." He said sincerely."I believe you." Harry nodded. He wasn't used to trusting adults to keeping their word but he did trust Snape. "Finding out about Sirius Black just makes everything worse. My parents trusted him so much that they trusted him to look after me. They must have known in those final moments that he had betrayed them…" Harry trailed off. He couldn't imagine the pain of that. Despite having occasional arguments with them, he trusted Ron and Hermione with his life. And he was on his way to trusting his new friends the same way. He just couldn't imagine such a betrayal.Hesitating only for a second, Snape put his arm around Harry. "They put their trust in the wrong person but no one knew where Sirius Black's loyalties actually lied. I detest the man and even I was shocked. And in their final moments Harry, all your parents would have been thinking about was you and doing what they could so you would survive. Which you did, thanks to your mother's incredible bravery and sacrifice.""The day when Daphne and I were exploring the school and Professor Lupin found us, he told me that being irresponsible with my safety was a poor way to repay my parents for sacrificing their lives for me." Harry said in a defeated tone. "I've never meant to do that. Not ever."Snape gritted his teeth. Lupin had a lot of explaining to do. "You shouldn't be irresponsible with your safety because your life matters. You matter. That is why I want you safe."Harry's eyes had brightened a bit. "Thank you Professor."Snape nodded. "There is another subject you should be aware of. I have received the guardianship papers. I plan to take them to the Dursley's tomorrow to get them signed. They will then be filed and it will be official.""And you still want to right? You haven't changed your mind?" Harry asked. He hated that he still felt insecure about it but it just seemed too good to be true, having an adult that would actually take care of him."Of course I have not. Don't make me take points for asking such ridiculous questions." Snape rolled his eyes. He cast a tempus. "There is still time for us to eat dinner. Come, I'm sure you will want your dessert with a small side of healthy food to inhale."Harry followed him through the hallway. "I don't inhale my food." He protested with a smirk. "Although, it's hard not to with treacle tart. It's the best dessert you know.""Is it? I prefer Banoffee pie myself." Snape said as they entered the Great Hall. "Dinner is almost over so hurry and eat. And if you do not eat a vegetable so help me-""Pass the carrots please." Harry said in a loud voice as he sat down. He couldn't help smiling as he began to fill his plate."Are you all right?" Daphne asked. "Your hand looks better.""Professor Snape healed it. Sorry if I scared you guys earlier." Harry said guilty."Don't worry about it." Theo said."Who wouldn't have a meltdown after hearing that a murderer is your godfather?" Draco said with a shrug as he finished off his pot roast. He sighed when Daphne threw a roll at him."I didn't have a meltdown." Harry made a face. Well…maybe he had. "It was just too much information all at once.""You feel better about it now?" Daphne asked, smirking as she deflected the roll Draco had thrown back at her to hit Theo.Harry grinned as he saw Theo's glare. "Yeah, I do actually." He looked at Daphne. "Did you ask Professor Snape to check on me?""Yes." Daphne answered unapologetically. "You were so upset and I was afraid you would hurt yourself more. I thought talking to him would be best especially since…" Her voice dropped to where only Harry could hear it. "He's going to be your guardian and all.""Tomorrow." Harry told her. He couldn't help but smile. "Tomorrow I will have a real guardian."HPHPHPHPSnape watched to make sure Harry was eating properly and then turned his attention to the wolf who had the misfortune of sitting next to him. He had promised Dumbledore to keep Lupin's secret from the students although he couldn't help himself from assigning that werewolf essay. He had an urge however to tell the entire Great Hall about Lupin's condition. In part it was to protect the students as he did not trust Lupin to diligently take his Wolfsbane potion which was why he usually stayed in his nemesis presence while he drank it. Another part of the reason to tell them was in retaliation to what Lupin had done to Harry."You have a lot of nerve." Snape said in a low voice.Remus looked at him in surprise and then followed his gaze to Harry. His face fell. "I didn't mean to tell him those things. It just came out. Is he okay?""Do you really care?" Snape shot at him. "How do you think he is? How could you overburden him with all that information?""Honest Severus, I didn't mean to." Remus said in a regretful tone. "He looks so much like James that I forgot I was talking to a child that had enough going on in his life. I need to make amends with him. I also don't want him to think badly of his father.""He is not his father." Snape said stiffly. "He doesn't have that same mean streak in him.""Severus," Remus began."He knows his father died trying to protect him. He hasn't been turned against James." Snape said in a controlled voice. "But you telling him that Black is his godfather was completely irresponsible. First of all it was not your place and second of all, the child has enough on his shoulders.""I know. It was wrong of me to do. I thought he would have known but I should have made sure." Remus sighed. "Believe me Severus, I feel horrible about letting it slip. And I know it is not my place, it would be his relatives or Dumbledore-""Actually no. It would be his new guardian who happens to be me!" Snape hissed.Remus stared at him in shock. "You? Why? What about his relatives?"Snape stared back at him. "They proved to not be acceptable guardians." Was all he replied.Remus's eyes hardened and took on a more yellowish color which made Snape lean back warily. "Did they hurt him?" He asked in almost a growl. It would make sense, the way he was affected by the Dementors. They were attracted to the people who had the worst of horrors in their past. The Headmaster had even said Harry had more in his past than the night his parents had died."I will not say more as it is Harry's prerogative to talk of them." Snape said slowly. "And it is not to be mentioned to anyone else."Remus gained control of his anger and looked sadly over to where Harry was. "I understand.""And do not ever make Harry feel guilty about his parents dying for him. He knows better than anyone what a sacrifice that was!" Snape glared at the wolf.Remus nodded, feeling even guiltier. He hadn't meant to hurt Harry. He said quietly. "I'm happy that he will have someone adequate to care for him now."Snape was a little surprised that Lupin wasn't kicking up a fuss about him being the guardian of James Potter's son. He inclined his head in response. "One more thing Lupin. If you say or do anything to hurt Harry again I will make sure the next time you drink your Wolfsbane, you will be most unpleasantly surprised." He was surprised once again when the wolf smiled in response."I wouldn't expect anything less Severus."HPHPHPHPAfter dinner Ron and Hermione caught up with Harry. "I know we can't talk long because of the new curfew but we saw that you were late to dinner." Hermione said."Everything okay mate?" Ron asked.Harry knew it was time to tell them everything. They were his best friends and he needed to tell them about the abuse and about Snape becoming his guardian. He could only hope they took it well."There are some things I want to tell you." Harry admitted. "I should have told you sooner but it has been hard for me to talk about. Tomorrow after breakfast I have some time before the game against Ravenclaw. Will you two meet me in the library so we can talk?""Of course we will!" Hermione exclaimed."You can tell us anything. We're your best friends." Ron added.Harry nodded. "I know. Tomorrow we'll talk and I'll update you on all that has been going on." He wasn't looking forward to the conversation but it was time.HPHPHPHPSnape apparated to number four Privet Drive in Surrey early in the morning. He had wanted to make sure he got there before Vernon Dursley left for work, plus he had the bonus of ruining their day before it even began. He strolled up the walkway and knocked briskly on the front door.What Snape could only assume was a walrus opened the door. "What do you want? If you're selling something I'm not interested." Vernon Dursley barked. He looked at Snape suspiciously, noting how he was dressed. Snape narrowed his dark eyes at the man who had almost killed Harry. "Mr. Dursley, I am a Professor at your nephew's school."Vernon snorted. "No wonder you are dressed like that. What's the whelp done now? Because we don't care, we don't want to be bothered by the boy until we absolutely have to." Vernon suddenly looked hopeful. "Unless he's dead or something. Is he? Because then I-Ooof!"Petunia Dursley shrieked as her husband suddenly flew into the living room and crashed into the coffee table. "Vernon what happened?" She struggled to help lift her heavy husband but wasn't able to do it and finally stepped away from him, panting with exertion.Snape entered the room with his wand out and a murderous expression on his face. Petunia gasped when she saw him. "You! What are you doing here Severus Snape?"Snape sneered at her. "I'm touched you remember me Tuney. I'm here to discuss the mistreatment of your nephew.""Wh-what mistreatment?" Petunia asked as her eyes nervously set on the wand pointed straight at her. "Whatever the little freak has told you-""Who are you calling a freak, you worthless muggle!" Snape hissed. "And the child didn't have to say anything! We ran a full health scan on him and it showed everything from the time he was left on your doorstep!""He deserved it!" Vernon huffed as he finally managed to get himself up, wincing from the pain of his fall. "He's a horrible boy, always doing freaky things!""He's a wizard and you knew that when you took him in!" Snape roared at the quivering couple. "You made him feel like something was wrong with him when you knew it was accidental magic. If it was not for the magic trying to heal and protect him he would have succumbed long ago to the injuries you had caused." Snape stared at Petunia. "Your sister's child. Your sister! She would never have treated your son so cruelly if the situation had been reversed."Petunia looked away for a second. "As if I would ever want my precious son raised by a freak like her." She muttered. "All she did was embarrasses our family with her abilities and then get herself killed for that horrid child."The living room shook with the strength with the anger and power of Snape's magic and anger. "I would watch what you say Petunia. My patience is already over the limit." He whispered dangerously. Frames and mirrors fell from the walls. He smirked. "Oh dear." He said in mock sympathy. "Two broken mirrors. Fourteen years of bad luck I believe that is."Petunia's eyes widened. "What are you going to do?" She stood behind Vernon."Hmm." Snape stroked his chin thoughtfully. "That depends. You see, you have been shown to be unfit guardians for Harry. Therefore, I will need both of your signatures to relinquish your full guardianship over to me."Vernon and Petunia looked relieved. "Is that all you came for? Where do we sign?" Petunia asked eagerly."This means we won't be saddled with the freak ever again right?" Vernon also looked eager."No you won't ever have to be bothered again." Snape said in a mock sympathetic voice. He held out the papers he had acquired from the ministry and watched as both the Dursley's signed it. As soon as they had finished, the paper vanished causing them to yelp in surprise. "Oh, don't worry. The forms just went to the proper office to be processed. You now have no claim to Harry.""Finally! Now will you leave?" Petunia said, glaring at him.Now that they had done what he needed them to do, Snape was able to fully unleash his anger. The room began shaking again and items such as pillows and fragile figurines began to fly around the room. Petunia shrieked and hid behind Vernon."You should be sent to Azkaban for your treatment of your nephew. Do you know what Azkaban is?" Snape gave a terrible grin. "It is our wizarding prison. There you would be drained of any happiness and joy and left feeling only despair. However, Harry does not wish to press charges against you." Snape watched as the Dursley's relaxed with relief. Their relief would be short lived. "Therefore, I have taken it upon myself to exact justice for the child.""Now see here…" Vernon began shakily."No, you see here!" Snape thundered at him and the whole house now shook from Snape's magic. "You abused your own nephew. A child! When you took Harry in, that meant you were agreeing to care for him. You failed and now it is time to accept the consequences!""What are you going to do to us?" Petunia whispered fearfully."Fortunam Despicerent." Snape waved his wand around them. "Twelve years of bad luck will follow you wherever you go." Snape whispered darkly, the room still cackling with his magic. "Twelve years you will not have a good night's sleep as Harry didn't. You will feel hungry no matter how much you eat, as Harry felt hunger.""You-you can't do this!" Petunia wailed. "I never wanted the whelp! And what about my Dudley?""Your spawn will suffer the same, only to a slightly lesser degree as he is a child following your example." Snape snarled. He smirked. "But don't worry; I will refrain from including him in the final consequence.""Final consequence?" Vernon asked somewhat faintly.Snape smiled a nasty smile as he once again waved his wand over the two terrified Dursley's. "Pain!" He hissed. "You will know pain and fear as that innocent child did. It will not wear off until you are truly sorry for your treatment of him."Petunia gasped as she suddenly began to feel the effects of the spell. Her body ached as if she had been doing housework and yard work non-stop all day and her eyes began darting around the room as if expecting something or someone to jump out at her.Vernon put his hand to his face as it began to sting as if someone had slapped him. His side began to feel like he had been kicked hard. Repeatedly kicked hard. He also began to feel fearful, irrationally fearing that all the neighbors thought he and his family were nothing but freaks. "No, please!" He choked out. "Have mercy!"Snape stared at him and then laughed. "Mercy? You obviously have no idea who you're dealing with. If I could, I would do much much worse to you."Petunia glared hatefully at Snape. "I always knew you were a bad seed! I don't know why Lily ever cared for you!" She spat out. "She was a freak just like her son!"Snape in an instant was in Petunia's face, his wand pointed right at her heart. He had a fierce scowl on his face and his eyes were even darker than usual as anger filled them. "Never talk of Lily or Harry like that again." He whispered dangerously. "Never again!"Petunia paled and stepped back with a whimper."Now I will take my leave." Snape said, looking on with amusement as Vernon winced in pain and Petunia kept looking around with a fearful expression. "Good day to you." He mocked with a smirk and then turned and disapparated on the spot.TBC: Pretty please review if you get a chance! I love hearing from you!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.Harry was summoned to Snape's office before breakfast. Wordlessly Snape handed him the official document that showed Harry was now the ward of Severus Snape. Harry stared at it for a moment, taking in the knowledge that it was now official. No more Dursley's. He wouldn't be hit or starved or locked up again. He wouldn't have to fear summers anymore. He wouldn't need to hide food under the floorboard anymore. He looked up at Snape with glassy eyes. "Thank you." He said hoarsely. "Thank you for doing this. You don't know what it means to me.""Yes I do." Snape said simply. He had longed to be taken away from his abusive father so many times. He took a deep breath. "I am proud to call you my ward Harry. I want you to know that."Without really thinking about it Harry threw his arms around Snape and hugged him. Snape stiffened for a moment but slowly put his arms around Harry and hugged him back. He wasn't used to displays of affection but he supposed he would have to get used to it. Harry was a Slytherin yes, but he was also a Gryffindor and they tended to wear their emotions on their sleeves. Although, not nearly as bad as Hufflepuffs. Snape almost shuddered at the thought.Harry stepped back hoping his face wasn't red. He couldn't believe he had just hugged the man like that but he was overwhelmed by the guardianship. Never in a million years would he have thought he could escape the Dursley's before he was seventeen. "So…how was it at the Dursley's?" He asked curiously."You were right. They were quite rude to me." Snape remarked with an amused look.Harry slowly grinned. He could imagine. "I tried to warn you. Um, they are still in one piece right?"Snape snorted. "Of course they are." Unhappily in one piece, he thought smugly. "Now, as the guardianship is official there are some things we need to talk about. I will have rules, of course. I have a guest room that will now be your bedroom in my quarters. I do usually spend my time at Hogwarts even during the summer, though I do also have a house that I can show you. It is not much, especially as I do not go there often. We can talk about this at another time as breakfast is almost ready to start and you need to fuel up for the game. Curfews and allowance can be discussed later.""Allowance?" Harry asked in surprise. "I've never gotten allowance before.""I don't doubt it." Snape said. "As I said, we can discuss it later.""Thank you sir." Harry said happily.Snape nodded. "One more thing before you leave. Except for in class and the like, you may call me Severus if you would like to." He had thought about this and he did want Harry to feel comfortable and at home with him. Harry using his title even when school was out would definitely not achieve that.Harry's eyes widened. He supposed it would be weird to only call his guardian sir or professor all the time. He nodded in response. "Thank you…Severus." He gave a grin as he left for breakfast.HPHPHPHPAfter breakfast Harry assured his Quidditch team that he would be at the pitch in time to warm up before the game. He had told Daphne that he would be telling Ron and Hermione everything and she had looked pleased at the fact. Daphne and Astoria walked with him to the library as Astoria had to check out a book for one of her classes."Good luck." Daphne whispered as she walked away with her sister.Harry found Ron and Hermione already sitting at a table, waiting for him. They looked at him expectantly.Harry slid into a seat and took a moment to clear his thoughts. "I'm not sure how to start." He said finally. "Only a handful of people know about this and I really don't want anyone else to find out if I can help it.""You can trust us." Ron said seriously."We won't tell anyone anything you don't want us to." Hermione added."You know I ran away from my relatives because I had blown up my Aunt Marge." Harry started. "I never wanted to return to that house again. I tried to tell Fudge that but he sent me back anyway. I even showed him…" He paused. This was more difficult than he had thought it would be.Hermione frowned. "Showed him what?""The bruise on my face." Harry said softly.Ron's eyes widened. "What?""Your relatives." Hermione whispered. "They hurt you didn't they? More than we knew."Harry nodded slowly. "Yeah they did. And when I returned to their house I paid dearly for the incident with Aunt Marge. I was really hurt when school started.""I don't understand. You looked fine when we saw you." Hermione suddenly shut her eyes. "You were wearing glamour.""Yes." Harry admitted. "I desperately didn't want anyone to know about my bruises and my accidental magic responded by creating the glamour.""How bad were you hurt?" Ron asked in a hard voice.Harry hesitated. "I had bruises all over. My ribs were bruised and I was bleeding internally."Hermione gasped and Ron looked horrified. "You could have died so easily and we wouldn't even have known…" Hermione's eyes filled with tears. "How long have they hurt you that way?""Since I was really little." Harry answered. "It wasn't quite as bad as this past summer and Dudley did most of the hitting. You already know that they locked me in my room and didn't really feed me. I was locked up a lot only before Hogwarts my room was the cupboard under the stairs." He gave an involuntary shudder at mentioning the cupboard. Too many memories of being locked in the dark feeling cold, hungry and so alone."Oh Harry." Hermione took his hand and gave it a squeeze. "I'm so sorry.""We should have known. I should have had my parents check on you." Ron looked at his friend. "I'm sorry." He said with regret."It's not your fault. I didn't want anyone to know how bad it really was." Harry replied, running his hand through his hair with a sigh. He didn't want his friends feeling guilty."Someone should have known!" Ron said angrily. "You were left there and what, no cared to check?""Shh." Hermione said, looking around. She knew Harry wouldn't want anyone to overhear their conversation. Thankfully with the game getting ready to start, the library was fairly empty."Sorry." Ron mumbled. "You aren't going back there Harry. You can live at my house. My family considers you an honorary Weasley anyway."Harry smiled. "Thanks mate.""You know it's not your fault right Harry? That how they treated you was completely wrong?" Hermione asked intently."Yeah I know. I've been talking about it." Harry admitted."With Professor Dumbledore? Or with Professor McGonagall?" Hermione asked curiously."No. With Snape." Harry braced himself.Ron's mouth dropped open. "Why would you talk to that bat about this? I mean, I know he is your temporary Head of House but to give him ammunition against you…""He wouldn't use the information against me. He's been trying to help me come to terms with what happened." Harry informed his friends. "He encourages me to talk about it and reinforces that it was not my fault."Hermione's eyes brightened. "He's really helping you then. That's wonderful.""But it's Snape. How do we know that once Harry is back in Gryffindor he won't tell everyone about his relatives and make fun of him?" Ron protested."He won't!" Harry said in exasperation. "You don't understand. Snape isn't just helping me with what the Dursley's did to me, he also makes sure I eat enough, get enough sleep, talks with me about anything that I am upset over. He actually acts the way a real guardian should.""He's being a decent Head of House, fine." Ron leaned forward intently. "But he has hated you since the moment you entered his classroom. You can't trust him Harry.""I can trust him and I do." Harry responded firmly. "He told me how he treated me in the past was wrong. It was because of how my father was to him in school.""What do you mean?" Hermione asked."My Dad wasn't exactly nice to Snape when they were in school. He and his friends bullied him." Harry said. He was still upset at the thought that his own father had been a bully."Snape's probably lying about that." Ron scoffed."Snape didn't tell me. Professor Lupin did." Harry countered."What does Professor Lupin have to do with it?" Ron asked in confusion.Harry drummed his fingers on the table. "I've been having lessons with Lupin to teach me the Patronus Charm to keep away the Dementors. He also has been telling me about my parents. He was best friends with my Dad, as was Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew.""Sirius Black was friends with your Dad?" Hermione asked incredulously."Best friends. Like brothers, from what Lupin told me. In fact my parents trusted him so much they made him my godfather." Harry grimaced at the reminder."What?!" Ron yelped."Ron hush!" Hermione scolded. She looked at Harry with sad eyes. "I can't believe you have been going through all of this.""No one is going to let Sirius Black get to you. My family will protect you." Ron said determinedly."I know they would Ron. But actually I have a new guardian." Harry said and his eyes brightened at the thought."That's great Harry! Who is it?" Hermione asked eagerly."Professor Snape." Harry answered a little hesitantly. He sighed when Ron shot out of his chair."Are you bloody out of your mind? Snape is going to be your guardian?" Ron practically shouted.Hermione grabbed Ron's arm and yanked him back into his chair. "Keep your voice down!""There's no one in here anyway!" Ron snapped at her though his eyes were on Harry.Harry looked around. Madame Pince was glaring in their direction but other than her the library was empty, except for Daphne and Astoria who were on the other side of the room. Daphne was staring in their direction with a look of fury directed at Ron while Astoria was paying them no mind as she read her book."Ron calm down. This is a good thing for me." Harry said, desperate for his friends to understand."Really? The man who has treated you like dirt and taken points right and left from you is a good thing for you?" Ron said sarcastically."He's helped me a lot with talking about the Dursley's and making sure I gained weight from being starved. He's defended me, healed me when I hurt myself, and cares about my safety. He's still strict and well, he's still Snape but he's different too. You'll see." Harry insisted. "He even told me stories about my Mum.""He did? Were they friends with each other?" Hermione asked in surprise.Harry nodded. "They were partnered up in Potions and sort of did become friends. Snape said she was really smart and kind to everyone." He looked at his friends. "You know I love you guys and I would really appreciate your support with all this. It hasn't been easy for me to tell you everything.""We know that." Hermione said softly. "I wish you had told us sooner, maybe we could have helped you.""Who else knows?" Ron asked suddenly."Snape, Dumbledore and Madame Pomfrey." Harry hedged. "And Daphne, Draco, Theo and Tracey. They've been really great about it.""You told them before us?" Ron stiffened. He looked at Harry with a hurt expression. "You couldn't tell us but you could tell them? Really? We were the ones with you when you wanted to protect the Sorcerer's Stone and we were the ones who helped with the Chamber of Secrets!""I know that Ron. I didn't tell them. They saw me without my glamour." Harry said patiently. "I didn't want to tell anyone." He sat back in his chair. "I was afraid to tell you two. I was afraid you would be mad that I had hidden the truth from you or worse, think I was pathetic because I couldn't protect myself against my relative's.""You were a child. There was nothing you could have done." Hermione said sadly. "I'm not mad that you felt you couldn't tell us. I'm sad that you were worried about it though. We're always here for you." She looked at Ron. "Right Ron?"Ron looked away for a moment. He then sighed. "I'm not mad and I hate that you have been hurt by your relative's. I still think you are bonkers for having Snape be your guardian but if you think it's a good idea, I'll support you. Well, I'll try to even though I don't really agree with your choice of guardian. But I reserve the right to say I told you so if it blows up in your face."Harry chuckled. "Thanks mate." He cast a tempus. "I better go. Will you guys be cheering me on at the game?" He asked with a grin."We'll be cheering you on, sure." Ron nodded with a grin as well. "I'm hoping you catch the snitch but Ravenclaw still wins."Harry rolled his eyes. "Better than nothing I guess.""I'll be rooting for Slytherin." Hermione said loyally.Ron shrugged. "It's going to take time for me to be able to fully support Slytherin, give me a break. Besides, he will be back in Gryffindor soon enough."Harry didn't respond to that. He missed Gryffindor of course; it had been his home the last two years. But he felt connected to Slytherin now as well and would miss being there. He liked the way Slytherin was run and how Snape kept a closer eye on his students. And to be honest, he was still upset with McGonagall in regards to how she had treated him. She had been fine with him since that incident, had even apologized and he suspected Snape had spoken to her. He had also heard that Cormac and Alexander kept getting detentions during potions and he had no doubt that it wasn't a coincidence.HPHPHPHPHarry left the library to get ready for the game, feeling lighter now that Ron and Hermione were up to speed on everything that had been going on in his life. He rounded the corner and almost bumped into Professor Lupin."Sorry Harry, I didn't see you." Remus apologized. "I'm glad I ran into you though. I've wanted to apologize to you for our last lesson.""It's okay." Harry shrugged. It was better that he knew the truth."No it's not. I fear I painted your father in a bad light. He was a good man Harry, truly. He grew up." Remus said earnestly."I know. I was disappointed to hear he had been like that but I know he was a good man. I know he loved me and died trying to protect Mum and me." Harry said quietly.Remus nodded, looking relieved. "I shouldn't have told you about Sirius Black. I shouldn't even have mentioned him. I'm so sorry.""At least I know the truth now." Harry looked at his professor. "It must have been very hard to lose two of your friends and then find out that your other friend was not who you thought he was. That must have really hurt."Remus nodded. "It was." He said softly. It had been devastating to lose all his friends the same day. He smiled ruefully. "I see what Severus means when he says you are like your mother. She was one of the most compassionate people I have ever met. She was there for me through a very troubling time in my life. James and Lily both were exceptional people Harry, and they would be very proud of you."Harry felt a warm glow spread through him. "Thank you Professor." He said softly. "Are you coming to watch the game?""Of course. I hear the best seeker Hogwarts has ever seen is playing." Remus teased.Harry made a face. "As long as I don't fall off my broom again.""Have you replaced your broom yet?" Remus asked as he walked with his student."No. I'm borrowing Draco's for this game. He agreed to use the school broom." Harry answered. They got to the grounds and Harry began hurrying over to the tent to change. "See ya after the game!" He called behind him.HPHPHPHPHarry's eyes were scanning the sky for signs of the snitch. The game was intense, both teams playing as hard as they could. Slytherin was up on points but Harry knew it was time to catch the snitch and end it before Ravenclaw pulled ahead again. The Ravenclaw seeker, Cho Chang, was watching him closely and Harry had to resist rolling his eyes. Predictable. The opposing seeker would watch him and then follow once Harry started after the snitch. It did give him the opportunity to fake them out however.In the corner of his eye a flash of gold sped by him and he took off, aware that Cho was now following him. He dipped his broom lower, playing as if the snitch was moving down. He kept his eyes on where the snitch actually was and once Cho had started lowering her broom he pulled his up in a burst of speed. Reaching out his hand, he began closing in on the golden prize. He suddenly heard gasps and looked down to see two Dementors on the pitch. Without even thinking about it, he drew out his wand and remembering how he felt when he saw the official guardianship papers he yelled out, "Expecto Patronum!" He didn't falter and within seconds his hand closed over the snitch, ending the game. Breathing hard he looked to where a crowd had gathered on the pitch where the Dementors were. He landed his broom, feeling proud that he hadn't felt that coldness or heard his mother's scream."Harry! That was amazing!" Draco said enthusiastically as he and Theo landed next to him."Brilliant!" Theo added.Graham walked up to them beaming. "Great job! First that fake out with Cho Chang and then your Patronus! So awesome!""Did it chase the Dementors away?" Harry asked eagerly. He looked to where the crowd was still gathered and frowned. He saw angry looks on the Professor's faces, especially Snape and McGonagall."Um, actually Harry those weren't Dementors." Theo said with a slight smirk."What?" Harry asked in confusion."It wasn't Dementor's, it was dunderheads." Draco snickered as they made their way through the crowd."I am appalled at your behavior! How dare you pull such a stunt!" Professor McGonagall was ranting at Cormac McLaggen and Alexander, both of who were dressed in long hooded black robes.Harry felt his face flush with embarrassment as he realized that there hadn't been Dementors at all. There went feeling proud that he hadn't been affected by them. The whole school had seen him cast a Patronus at two students. How humiliating."I should expel you both for being so foolish!" Professor McGonagall continued. "You both have shown that you are unworthy of being a Gryffindor!""Minerva, perhaps you can finish discussing their behavior in your office." Dumbledore said quietly, his normally twinkling eyes looking sternly at the two miscreants. "What you two did showed spitefulness and complete irresponsibility. I am very disappointed in you two.""As am I. My office now!" Professor McGonagall led her two students away, a furious look on her face."Oh gentlemen." Snape said softly as they passed him. His eyes were cold and dangerous. "Don't forget you already have detention with me this evening." His tone promised that it would be extremely unpleasant.Cormac and Alexander gulped and quickly followed their Head of House away from the irate Potion's Professor."Harry we won!" Astoria was practically jumping up and down in her excitement. "And that deer was so cool!""Bloody brilliant was what it was." Ron gave a congratulatory slap to Harry's back."What deer?" Harry asked distractedly."Your Patronus!" Hermione exclaimed. "It was wonderful!""It was a deer?" Harry asked curiously."A stag." Hermione nodded."Huh." Harry wished he had seen it. He wondered why it had taken the form of a stag. "I can't believe I thought they were Dementor's." He said with a sigh."They looked the part. I was fooled at first too." Draco admitted."Harry." Snape led him a few steps away from the crowd. "Congratulations on your win. I am also exceptionally proud of your ability to cast a Patronus as well. A thirteen year old being able to cast a corporeal Patronus is unheard of. You should be very proud of yourself."Harry brightened at the praise. "Thanks Professor. I feel foolish for thinking they were Dementors though.""Don't. They went to great lengths to look the part." Snape replied and his anger was still strong at those two idiot students.Remus walked up to them, slightly pale yet with a broad smile on his face. "Harry that was truly magnificent! It was just like his!""Like whose?" Harry asked curiously."James." Remus's smile grew. "His Patronus was a stag as well."Harry felt a smile creeping on his face. Despite being angry that his father had been a bully in school, it felt nice to have another connection to him. He looked to Snape a little apprehensively.Snape just rolled his eyes and smirked. "Quite impressive yes. Now, I believe there is a victory party being planned in the common room?"The Slytherins cheered and began hurrying to the castle. Whenever Slytherin won it was arranged with the house elves to decorate and prepare food to celebrate.Harry was feeling so happy and relaxed that he didn't notice the black dog watching him intently from afar.TBC: Review if you get a chance!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you to everyone who has reviewed my story! I really appreciate it! I hope you enjoy this chapter! =)The Slytherin party went late. Harry was impressed with the spread of food and desserts that were laid out as well as the green and silver balloons in the shapes of snitches decorating the common room. Usually when Gryffindor won, Fred and George snuck in sweets from the kitchen but this was much more extravagant. Everyone was in a good mood, eating and joking and many had come up to Harry to congratulate him. Even Blaise, Pansy and their group had put aside their usual snide remarks and were enjoying the party.Harry and his friends were sitting in their usual spot by the fireplace and Harry was eating a slice of the pie Snape had mentioned once, Banoffee pie. It was delicious."I can't get over how amazing your Patronus was." Daphne remarked as she took a bite of her lemon biscuit."I wish I had seen it." Harry grinned. "Especially knowing my Dad had an identical one.""I'm glad you didn't see it." Draco cut in. "You might have gotten distracted and not caught the snitch!""True." Harry admitted. "Hey, thanks again for lending me your broom.""No problem. That school broom is horrible." Draco made a face. "Thankfully I'm a very skilled flyer." He smirked.Theo snickered. "Then why did Graham have to keep shouting at you to get control of your broom?"Tracey giggled. "You practically kept veering off the pitch.""All right, geez." Draco rolled his silver grey eyes.As Theo and Tracey continued to tease Draco, Daphne turned to Harry. "It looked like Ron and Hermione took your news well. At least, it appeared that way towards the end of the conversation." She said quietly."Did you stay to keep an eye on me?" Harry asked curiously with a smile on his face.Daphne blushed slightly. "I may have wanted to make sure they didn't completely freak out on you. So what?" She shrugged casually."Astoria didn't appear to notice how loud Ron was getting." Harry said thoughtfully.Daphne smiled a little. "I may have put an anti-eavesdropping spell around her that my Mum taught me. She didn't hear any of it."Harry laughed. "Such a smart Slytherin you are.""But of course." Daphne tilted her head to the side. "So do you feel better that you told them the truth? I feel kind of bad that I kept pushing for you too. I just thought it would help in the long run." She hoped she hadn't been too pushy about it."No, I do feel better." Harry assured her. "I'm glad I told them. They are only concerned about Snape being my guardian.""When does that officially happen anyway?" Daphne asked, her eyes on the pie he had half finished."It's already happened. This morning Snape showed me the official guardianship papers." Harry said happily."That's wonderful!" Daphne leaned over and hugged him. "I'm so happy for you Harry. You're free of your relatives forever now!""I know. It's still hard to believe." Harry grinned. He lowered his voice. "Except for classes, I'm even allowed to call him Severus."Daphne's eyes widened. She grinned mischievously. "I dare you to call him that in class. Or during a meal in the Great Hall, you could call to him from our table!"Harry snorted. "Yeah I'll do that if I don't want to live to see fourteen. He did say we would have to discuss rules and an allowance. Can you believe he wants to give me an allowance?" Harry shook his head in wonder."I get one. Most kids do." Daphne said. How sad that Harry was so excited by a small thing like an allowance which most kids took for granted, herself included. "I think it's great. You deserve something good happening to you."Harry smiled softly in response and held out his plate of pie. "Do you want a bite? I can't ignore your drooling anymore.""I am not drooling!" Daphne protested with a laugh. She eyed his plate and then shrugged and took a fork and broke off a piece. She closed her eyes in bliss after she took a bite. "Now that is yummy. I haven't tried it before.""Severus recommended it." Harry smirked.Daphne stared at him. "So weird to hear you say his name. It's crazy how things have changed huh?"Harry nodded in agreement. Who could have predicted that his third year of Hogwarts he would be sorted into Slytherin and have Snape become his guardian? Or that he would make friends in Slytherin? It was a good change however. If Sirius Black would just get caught then everything would be great.The door opened and Snape walked into the common room. He surveyed the mess and the students lounging around. "I do hope you have all enjoyed yourselves as I now insist you all go to bed. I let you stay up late for the party but now the party is over." He gave a stern look to the few students who started protesting, which were mostly first years who were still learning that whining to their Head of House was not a good idea."Thank you for the party Professor Snape." Graham spoke up as the older students began cleaning up. They weren't allowed to rely on house elves to do the entire cleaning or bed making as Professor Snape did not tolerate laziness.Snape nodded in approval as students began picking up after themselves and Megan started ushering the younger years to their dorms. He caught Harry's eye and motioned for his ward to come to him."You enjoyed yourself I trust?" Snape asked."Yeah, this was great!" Harry grinned."I'm happy you enjoyed yourself. I wanted to let you know that we are going on an outing tomorrow after breakfast." Snape said, not sure how to delicately put this."What kind of outing?" Harry asked curiously."Shopping. You need new clothes." Snape said bluntly. He had seen during the weekends that many of Harry's clothes looked big and worn, though there were some that looked new. He had asked Draco and Theo about the state of Harry's wardrobe and they confirmed that while there were a few items of nice clothing, the rest were rags."No I don't." Harry protested. He could feel his face heat up in embarrassment."You do." Snape disagreed. "Tomorrow we will go to Hogsmeade and get you some new items of clothing.""I don't need…wait, Hogsmeade?" Harry perked up at that.Snape looked smug. He knew it would be hard for the child to accept getting new clothes from him so he figured he could distract him by letting him see the sights of Hogsmeade. He had briefly thought about letting Harry go with friends but there was no way he was letting the child out of his sight with Black still on the loose. "Yes, and if you don't put up a fuss about going shopping I will let you stop at a few of the shops that your peers seem to love." He mentally rolled his eyes at the thought of the joke shop and what a headache that was when students dared to use those products in his class. "We will also make a stop in Muggle London for some clothes as well though I would like to make that trip as fast as possible.""I'll need to go to Gringotts to pull out some money." Harry said slowly. He really wanted to go to Hogsmeade. Another trip was coming up and now Snape could sign the permission slip for him but he knew there was still a chance he wouldn't be allowed to go with Sirius Black still out there."We will not be going to Gringotts, there is no need." Snape said smoothly.Harry frowned. "I need to pull out more money for the clothes." He pointed out.Snape sighed. "Harry, what were the papers that I showed you this morning?""The guardianship papers." Harry answered in confusion."The papers that show I am now your official guardian, yes. Now of all your friends, how many of their guardians or parents make them pay for their own clothes?" Snape asked, crossing his arms across his chest.Harry opened his mouth and then closed it. Okay, so he knew that other kids had their parents who paid for their clothes and supplies but this was different wasn't it? "It's not the same." He said lamely.Snape raised an eyebrow. "Really? How so?""You're already helping me out by getting me away from the Dursley's; I shouldn't be a financial burden on you as well." Harry argued.Snape bent down to look his ward in the eye. "When I decided to become your guardian I knew that it would mean that I would take care of you now. Being a guardian is more than putting a roof over a child's head, it means caring for them and providing for them. I now provide for you Harry." Snape straightened up, still keeping eye contact. "I will supply your clothing, your food, your school books and whatever else you need. I will also provide you with an allowance so that you can buy the frivolous things most teenagers like to buy themselves. And to be clear on this, I am not merely doing this because I have to but because I want to. Am I understood?"Harry felt his throat tighten and after a moment, he nodded.Snape nodded as well. "Meet me at my office after breakfast. Good night Harry.""Goodnight…" Harry looked around and saw that the other students were gone from the common room. "Severus." He finished with a grin."Go to bed brat." Severus shook his head only allowing himself to grin after Harry had gone to his dorm. It would take getting used to, having the child call him Severus but he found he didn't mind. Not with his own ward anyway. Taking a teenager shopping was not something he ever would have thought he would do but things were different now. He had a child to take care of and provide for.HPHPHPHPHarry nervously waited by Snape's office after breakfast the next morning. He had to admit he was apprehensive at going shopping with Snape. He had never gone clothes shopping with an adult before. The Weasley's had taken him to get his schoolbooks and Harry had picked up a few different clothing items here and there but this was different. This time Snape would be paying and Harry wasn't used to that. He would try to get Snape to take him to Gringotts so he could pull out some money. Wasn't that the responsible thing to do? To pay for his own clothing?"Inside." Snape walked past him and opened his office. He then led Harry to his fireplace. "We will floo to our quarters first. I need to grab a change of clothes for when we go to the muggle shops."Once they stepped out of the floo Harry looked around with interest at Snape's quarters. He had expected green and silver but instead it was mainly done in brown and black with cream colored walls. There was a splattering of dark green, like the pillows on the couch and rug on the floor but it wasn't overwhelming."Does my decorating meet with your approval?" Snape asked in amusement as he watched Harry look around. "Is it what you expected?"Harry shook his head. "No, there's no bats or-" He yelped and narrowly dodged a light stinging hex sent his way. "I was kidding!" He protested with a laugh."Your room is this way." Snape smirked as he led Harry down the hallway. "And if you would like your room decorated with bats I can arrange that."Harry's room was done in the same colors except there was also a dark maroon mixed in. The room had a very earthy look which Harry liked a lot. "This is brilliant, thank you."Snape nodded, pleased that Harry liked it and then pointed to another door. "The bathroom is through there. My room is across the hall. You saw the sitting room and there is also a small kitchen." He cast a tempus. "Wait for me in the sitting room. We will leave in a couple of minutes."Harry walked back to the sitting room and leaned against the fireplace. He saw in the corner of the room a desk and bookshelf. He guessed those had been moved there from what was now his room. When Snape entered the room he pointed to it. "I feel bad that you don't have an office anymore."Snape shrugged as he grabbed the floo powder. "I have an office where I meet with students and colleagues. I certainly do not need two."When they arrived at Hogsmeade Harry began looking around in wonder. It looked like a Christmas card as snow was beginning to fall. It was a village of cottages and shops. They passed Honeydukes and Harry was reminded of the secret passage way at Hogwarts that led there. They also passed Zonko's joke shop which Harry had heard so much about from his friends.As soon as they stepped into Gladrag's, a young man in his early twenties stepped forward. "How may I help you?" He paled a little. "Professor Snape. Um, er how are you?""Hello Mr. Frimley." Snape said. He nodded towards Harry. "Mr. Potter needs a new wardrobe. I trust you can take care of that?""Harry Potter! Wow! My name is Phillip. I graduated several years ago." Phillip face lit up at meeting the wizarding world's celebrity.Harry flushed. He never knew how to act when people acted like this when they met him. "Hello." He mumbled.Snape saw how uncomfortable Harry was and realized the child hated how people treated him because of his fame. In the past he had thought the boy would revel in it but now he knew better. "You may ask for his autograph later Mr. Frimley, right now he needs a new wardrobe. You are able to handle that, correct?" His asked his former student in a cold voice."Oh, sorry." Phillip said in embarrassment. "I can help you. Come this way."Harry spent the next twenty minutes picking out shirts, trousers, socks and shoes. He had to laugh at some if the crazy socks they sold. He couldn't help but think of Dobby when he saw them.Harry took a deep breath as Snape paid for the modest bundle of clothes. "I would really like to go to Gringott's and help pay for all of this."Snape took the receipt and shrunk the bag of clothes. He handed it to Harry who put it in his pocket. "If I hear another word about money I will pick out your clothes myself. That shirt over there with the little dragons moving all over it might be nice for you."Harry looked at the shirt, which looked like it was for a little kid, in horror. "You wouldn't!""One more word and you can best believe I will. In fact, there looks like there is a whole dragon line including pajamas." Snape threatened.Harry's eyes widened and he shut his mouth."Good day to you Mr. Frimley." Snape said as he steered Harry out of the store."What about my autograph?" Phillip called after them.Snape ignored him as he and Harry continued walking down the path. "Hufflepuffs." He muttered. He cast a side glance towards his ward. "Cease sulking.""I'm not sulking." Harry said. He made a face when he realized that his voice came out in a whine. Okay, so maybe he was sulking a little bit. "I just want to help.""We've talked about this and I do not want to keep rehashing it. You are the child; you do not pay for clothes. You do not pay for school supplies. End of conversation." Snape snapped. He stopped walking. "Before we head to muggle London, did you want to visit any of the shops?" He asked in a gentler tone."Um, Honeydukes and Zonko's?" Harry's face brightened when Snape nodded."Now these are the types of shops that you can use your allowance for." Snape said as he watched Harry look around in awe at all the candy and fudge in Honeydukes. "Go ahead and pick out a few things. I owe you an allowance for good grades and behavior."Harry couldn't help but smile and went about looking at the mounds of chocolate, nougat and barrels of Every Flavor Beans. He picked out some Treacle Fudge and Sugar Quills to hand out to his friends. At Zonko's he laughed at all the products and when eyeing the Dungbombs, Snape stepped closer to him. "I better not find that in my classroom." Snape said darkly.Harry snickered. "I was actually thinking of Trelawney's classroom.""Oh. Don't get caught." Snape said smoothly. He eyed the products in the store, recognizing many that he had confiscated from his students.Harry gaped at him in surprise and then chuckled. He bought the Dungbombs and then Snape took him to the Three Broomsticks. There Harry had a Butterbeer, only this one was hot and it warmed him from the inside out. "Thank you for bringing me out today. Hogsmeade is brilliant.""I am glad you are enjoying yourself." Snape said as he sipped his tea."Do you think Sirius Black will be caught soon?" Harry asked hesitantly.Snape eyed him evenly. "Yes. Eventually he will make a mistake and make himself known. Do not worry Harry, he will not hurt you. I will not let him.""I know." Harry nodded. "I just don't want to have to look over my shoulder anymore.""I know. He will be caught." Snape said with determination. Even if I have to go hunt him down myself, he thought darkly. "I understand this year has been somewhat trying for you. I am quite proud of how you have handled everything. The Headmaster mentioned that you would make friends in Slytherin and I didn't think it was possible.""The houses shouldn't be so divided." Harry said thoughtfully. "I mean, I get the friendly competition thing but that's the problem. It's not friendly. Every house has something to offer right?""They do." Snape admitted. He might put down the other houses but he knew that what Harry said was true; every house did have something to offer. "There are good points and bad points to every house. Unfortunately it would probably be very hard to truly unite the houses. The only house that mostly gets along with Slytherin is Ravenclaw because they can appreciate ambition.""I still think everyone could be friends if they put aside their misconceptions of each other. Well, except for those who truly support Voldemort." Harry mused. He noticed Snape wince slightly. Harry frowned. "You're not afraid of his name are you?""No." Snape muttered, unconsciously rubbing his left arm. "It's just a response that can happen when you've been conditioned a certain way.""What do you mean?" Harry asked in confusion.Snape took a deep breath. "There is something you should know. I had not intended to tell you here but since the subject has been brought up…do you know what a Death Eater is?"Harry shook his head."A Death Eater is what the followers of Voldemort called themselves." Snape said slowly.Harry rolled his eyes. "Great name. Why did people want to follow him anyway?""He promised power, revenge against anyone who had hurt them and a place to belong to. Many did not realize what they were getting into when they joined and once you joined, you couldn't leave without being killed." Snape answered. He looked at Harry seriously. "Someone who felt like an outcast, who had an unhappy home life were more likely to follow him. Muggles may compare it to that of a cult. Of course, then you had those who knew exactly what they were getting into and followed him because they thrived on hate and causing pain just as he does."Harry stared at his almost empty mug of Butterbeer. "Wait, why are you telling me this?" He asked suddenly. "Unless…" He looked up at Snape with wide eyes. "Were you…?""Yes." Snape said bluntly.Harry practically dropped his mug of Butterbeer. His professor, his guardian had been a Death Eater? Harry stared at Snape in shock. Snape had been a follower of Voldemort?TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you for all the reviews, they make me so happy! =)"I joined the Death Eaters after I graduated Hogwarts." Snape began to explain before Harry's jaw could drop any further. He cast a muffliato around them. "There had only been two people in the world that I cared about and they were both lost to me forever." Thoughts of his own mother and Lily went through his mind. "I felt that I had nothing and then I was recruited by the Dark Lord. It made me feel wanted and important at the time. I wanted to belong to something and the promise of power and revenge was a strong motivation to join."Harry averted his eyes and took a deep breath. "But you're not a Death Eater anymore right?" He asked hesitantly.Snape tilted his head to the side. "What do you think?" He asked.Harry met his eyes after a moment. "You're not." He said more confidently. It was somewhat unsettling to know Snape had been a follower of Voldemort's but…he trusted Snape. The Headmaster trusted Snape. Whatever he had been in the past, Snape wasn't that person now."Finally I had had enough. The Dark Lord had gone too far so I asked Professor Dumbledore for help. I then became a spy for the side of the light." Snape continued, trying not to remember how low and horrible he had felt on that day when he had begged Dumbledore to save Lily. The disgust which had been on Dumbledore's face had been much deserved. "The Headmaster believes the Dark Lord will return someday and before becoming your guardian, I would have become a spy once again."Harry's mouth dropped open. Snape would have rejoined the Death Eaters to spy? "Isn't that extremely dangerous? What if you were found out?""I would be killed, of course." Snape took another sip of his iced tea.Harry shook his head. "Well, now I'm even happier that you are my guardian if it keeps you from having to spy." He declared."Doesn't it bother you that I was a Death Eater? I did unimaginable things." Snape was surprised that Harry hadn't started ranting or running away from him. He wouldn't have blamed the child if he had."I'm not happy about it." Harry said honestly. "I mean, it was a pretty mental thing to do."Snape rolled his eyes. "Eloquent as ever but yes, it was. At the time all I thought I needed was power and revenge and the Dark Lord promised that. It was a decision I came to deeply regret." He said in a low voice.Harry bit his lip when he saw the raw pain in Snape's eyes. It was a little unnerving that his guardian had been a Death Eater yet at least Snape trusted him enough to tell him about it. "Everyone makes mistakes." Harry said finally. Snape had saved his life during his first year. He was also saving his life by not letting him return to the Dursley's. "I trust you." He said simply.Snape raised an eyebrow in surprise but nodded. He had told Harry enough for now. "Now that we have that out of the way we can continue our shopping. We will floo to the Leaky Cauldron so I can change and then we will proceed."HPHPHPHPAfter they had returned to Hogwarts Harry couldn't stop chuckling to himself. Snape in the muggle world had been hilarious. He had still worn all black, though without his robes he looked a lot less intimidating. He had been impressed with how well Snape had fit into the muggle world, although it was obvious that he had hated every moment. Wearing black slacks, a long sleeved black shirt and his hair tied back into a ponytail he had looked a lot different. He still had sneered and snarled at the store clerks which Harry was sure he had enjoyed doing. He still was Snape after all. But the best part had been when one of the employees had tried flirting with him!"Buying new clothes? Where is your mother dear?" The store clerk lady asked after showing him where the jeans were. "Oh. She passed away a long time ago." Harry answered quietly as he picked out a pair of ripped jeans."Put those back. The point of a new wardrobe is so that you do not look homeless." Snape looked at the jeans in distaste. The store clerk gave an airy laugh. "You should listen to your father dear. He appears to have wonderful taste." She batted her eyelashes at Snape whose own eyes had narrowed as he sneered at her."Yes, I do, which is why I will end this conversation with you." Snape then had rolled his eyes and turned his back on her. He glared when Harry started laughing after the lady had walked away."She probably wanted you to ask her out." Harry smirked as he began looking through sweatshirts."You know, I think I have cauldrons that need scrubbing." Snape mused out loud."You could tell her that you are a Chemistry teacher, which is sort of like Potions." Harry continued to tease. He grabbed a couple of sweatshirts and T-shirts that he liked along with two pairs of jeans. "Take her out for a hamburger; tell her about all your dunderhead students…"Snape led him to the shoe department and leaned against a chair while Harry tried on a pair of new sneakers. "I believe my classroom floor could use a good scrubbing as well. Using a toothbrush." He continued in dangerous voice."All right, all right." Harry had given in. He suddenly looked curiously at Snape. "Do you already have a girlfriend?" He had never given thought to if Snape dated."No." Snape had said curtly. He relented when Harry still looked curious. "I was in love once. It would take a very special woman who could even come close to her." Not that that would ever happen. He couldn't imagine ever feeling for someone the way he felt about Lily. And the truth was he didn't deserve that kind of happiness, not after the terrible things he had done."What happened to her?" Harry had asked softly as they queued for his clothes."She died a long time ago." Snape had answered in a voice that indicated the conversation was over."Oh. I'm sorry." Harry had replied, feeling guilty for having asked.Harry put away some of his new clothes in his new room. Snape had bought him more than he had ever had before so he decided to keep some in their quarters and some in his dorm. He was still amused over the store clerk batting her eyelashes at Snape yet he felt bad for the man. He had obviously lost someone he had loved very much. Maybe that was part of the reason he was so surly, he was still in mourning.They had missed lunch at Hogwarts so Snape had taken him to a café for sandwiches. Harry wondered if this is how the other kids felt when they spent the day with their guardians or parents. It had been nice, getting the clothes he needed, talking and joking. It was something Harry could get used to.Harry sighed and looked at the small pile of clothes left on his bed. Dudley's old clothes. He had already changed into his new pair of jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt. He picked up one ragged shirt and played with the large hole in side. He ended up ripping it more and paused. A slow smile spread across his face and he started ripping all of the oversized shirts and pants he had been forced to wear. When he was done he stared in satisfaction at the tatters that now covered his bed."What are you doing?"Harry glanced at Snape who had an eyebrow raised. "Um, I thought you could use them as rags for when you have students clean your cauldrons and your vials and your classroom floor and-"Snape snorted and held up his hand. "I get it. Although, I have a better idea." He took out his wand. "Incendio!" The old rags immediately burned into nothing, yet the bed was left unscathed."Brilliant!" Harry grinned. "Why didn't the bed burn?""Because I am an exceptional wizard." Snape deadpanned. He left the room with Harry following him. "Part of your education is learning control when casting spells. That is why you do not play around with casting; it is too easy to make a mistake. That is another reason dueling is forbidden among students unless properly supervised.""Yes Professor." Harry said cheekily. He laughed when Snape scowled. "So is it okay for everyone to know about the guardianship?""It is. Eager to brag are we?" Snape drawled. Actually, he was pleased that Harry didn't mind everyone knowing.Harry snickered. He could imagine the looks of horror on everyone's faces when they found out. He hoped he could make them understand Snape wasn't the mean git they all thought he was. At least, not all the time he wasn't."Severus?"Snape turned. He frowned slightly when he saw the worried look on Harry's face. "Yes?"Harry looked away. "When you joined the Death Eaters, was it because of how my Dad treated you?" His voice was low."My decision to join the Death Eaters was my own." Snape replied in a firm tone. "No one forced me. It was my mistake alone; I don't blame anyone else for it.""Oh." Harry said in response. He decided to change the subject. "Thank you again for the clothes and taking me to Hogsmeade.""You are welcome. I enjoyed the day myself." Snape admitted. Even with the difficult subject of the Death Eaters, Harry had taken it well. He had found he actually enjoyed talking with the child."I'm going to take the rest of my clothes to my dorm. I want to show my friends what I got at Zonko's." Harry rubbed his hands together with glee."Be careful who you prank." Snape warned. "Slytherins retaliate. Stealthy of course.""Oh, I wasn't going to prank my friends. Well, maybe Draco. I was thinking of the Dungbombs in Trelawney's classroom." He smirked to himself, thinking of all the times she had predicted his death."Remember what I said." Snape said as Harry went to leave."I know, I know. Don't get caught." Harry laughed and left.HPHPHPHPAfter Harry had deposited his clothes into his dorm he went in search for his friends. To his surprise he found out from Astoria that they were in the library along with Ron and Hermione. He gave Astoria and Tabitha each a sugar quill and then went to the library."Harry!" Ron greeted a little too loudly."Shh!" Hermione and Daphne both hissed."Harry!" Ron repeated in an exaggerated whisper."Hey guys." Harry dropped into the seat between Ron and Daphne. He handed out the rest of the sugar quills."Thanks Harry!""Thanks mate!""So how was your outing?" Daphne asked curiously."It was really great!" Harry answered, taking a glance to the essay Ron was supposedly working on. He laughed when he saw it was full of doodles instead of writing. Ron caught his eye and gave a shrug in response. "Severus bought me a ton of new clothes. I've never had so much before!""Severus?" Draco asked incredulously.Theo chuckled. "Better not let him hear you call him that."Harry took a deep breath. "Actually, he told me I could except for in class. He's my new guardian."Draco's mouth dropped open. "Professor Snape is your new guardian?""Hard of hearing Malfoy?" Ron asked cheerfully.Draco cast him a withering look."Professor Snape offered to be my guardian and I agreed. I didn't want to say anything until the papers were officially signed which they now are." Harry told them."I think it is wonderful Harry." Tracey said warmly."So do I. You're going to have a much better life now." Theo said with a nod."As long as you're away from those horrible Dursley's." Ron sighed."You know?" Draco asked in surprise."We are his best friends, of course we know!" Ron replied frostily."We're his best friends too!" Draco shot back.Harry's eyes widened a little but he couldn't help but smile. It was true after all. Somehow along the way, these four Slytherins had become people he trusted, could talk to, and laugh with. Who knew that his third year he would gain Snape as a guardian and so many new friends?"Relax everyone." Hermione rolled her eyes. "We're all friends here.""Well…" Ron muttered. "Yeah, we are." He said reluctantly after Hermione glared at him. "Unless…no one else here has a rat eating cat do they?""Don't start that again." Hermione warned. "Scabbers probably just got sick of you."Ron made a face and Harry quickly changed the subject. "So what are you guys working on?""A case for Buckbeak." Hermione answered as she read through a rather large book."Blaise's Father is pushing for Buckbeak to be executed." Theo said quietly."He can't do that!" Harry exclaimed. He threw Madame Pince an apologetic look and lowered his voice. "It was Blaise's fault for ignoring Hagrid's instructions. Can't we do something?""That's why we are researching." Hermione said, tapping the large book in front of her. "I also think we should each write letters telling the ministry exactly what happened that day. Maybe we can get more students to do that as well.""Good idea, especially as it will be students from both Gryffindor and Slytherin agreeing that Buckbeak was not to blame for the attack." Daphne agreed.Harry leaned back into his seat and sighed. Poor Hagrid. If Buckbeak was killed he would be devastated. "Isn't there a way to make Blaise tell the truth?""Short of an illegal potion? Probably not." Draco said ruefully. "I doubt that even my Father could get Mr. Zabini to change his mind. They don't get along very well as each want to prove that they have more influence in the ministry." He rolled his eyes."Harry!"Startled, Harry turned and found Astoria hurrying up to him with her eyes wide and upset."Harry, you have to come! The idiots are up to something." Astoria tugged on his arm."You're going to have to be more specific than that." Draco said dryly."Tori, what's wrong?" Daphne asked in concern."The idiots, I mean Crabbe and Goyle, are up to something. Tabitha and I overheard them! They said your name and were whispering a lot and then took something wrapped in a blanket up to your dorm." Astoria finally managed to pull Harry up.Ron snickered. "Why do you call them the idiots? I know they are but…""That's what Draco calls them." Astoria said impatiently, trying to pull Harry away from the table. "What if they put something in your dorm to hurt you?"Draco pushed away from the table and stood up. "You guys keep working on Buckbeak's case. Harry and I will see what the idiots are up to.""Hurry!" Astoria grabbed Draco's hand as well and pulled both boys out of the library."Your sister is so cute." Hermione said with a smile as she watched the first year talking animatedly to Harry and Draco as they left.Daphne laughed. "She's something else, that's for sure. Although maybe I should go too, to make sure she is okay." She added in a worried tone."Nah, Harry and Draco wouldn't let anything happen to her." Theo waved off her concerns. "Besides, if it is just Crabbe and Goyle you can be sure that it nothing big. Those goons couldn't pull off a real prank on their own if their lives depended on it."HPHPHPHPHarry and Draco walked into their dorm after telling Astoria to stay in the common room just in case. Crabbe and Goyle were standing on the other side of the room with smirks on their faces."What are you two doing?" Harry asked with his hand on his wand just in case."Nothing." Crabbe said with a stupid grin on his face."Well, nothing unusual about that." Draco drawled. He couldn't believe he used to hang out with these two imbeciles.Harry suddenly noticed movement on his bed under a blanket. With a wry glance at Draco, he moved forward and yanked the blanket off. He raised an eyebrow and chuckled."What is it?" Draco walked closer."A snake." Harry answered as he looked at the small green and black snake. The snake lifted its head and blearily blinked its eyes.There was laughing from Crabbe and Goyle as they gave each other a high five. "Scared you I bet, right Potter?" Crabbe guffawed."Did his laughter sound like he was scared?" Draco shook his head at their stupidity.Harry bent down to the snake. "They didn't hurt you did they?" He hissed in Parseltongue."The two moronsss? No." The snake replied, tilting its head to look at Harry. "You ssspeak ssnake language?" It asked in surprise."Yesss." Harry answered."You are a rare breed." The snake said knowingly.Draco gave Crabbe and Goyle a withering look. "Did you two idiots forget that Harry can talk to snakes? Why would he be afraid of them?""Oh yeah." Goyle frowned, scratching his head.Harry rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to his visitor. "Did you come from the foressst?""Yesss. But I like it here better. It'sss warmer." The snake stretched up and wrapped itself around Harry's arm.Harry thought for a moment. "I can asssk if you can ssstay." Harry offered, rather liking the little snake. "What isss your name?"The snake blinked. "I do not have one, sssnake ssspeaker.""My name isss Harry." Harry nodded to Draco. "And thisss isss my friend Draco."The snake gave a nod. "And the two moronsss? Are they friendsss?"Harry laughed. "No. They thought you would ssscare me.""How dare they use a sssnake!" The snake looked offended."Ooh what a pretty snake!""Astoria Greengrass!"Astoria looked sheepishly at Draco who was frowning at her. "We told you to stay in the common room." He admonished her."It's okay Draco. There's nothing here to hurt her." Harry said, smiling at Astoria who stepped closer to the snake he was holding.Draco sighed exasperatedly. "She didn't know that though.""Sorry Draco." Astoria gave him a wide-eyed innocent look.Draco frowned. "Don't do that. I can't stay mad when you do that."Astoria gave Harry a smug look, which cause him to chuckle. "Is this your new familiar?""Um…" Harry shrugged. "I don't know if I can have two familiars.""What is its name?" Astoria asked as she gently stroked the snakes head."Doesn't have one." Harry answered."It's your new familiar, it needs a name." Astoria said firmly."Hmm, why don't you think of one?" Harry suggested to the little girl."She'sss nice." The snake hissed as Astoria continued to coo over it."She'sss a friend too." Harry told it.Astoria looked over to where Crabbe and Goyle were still standing in the corner of the dorm with frowns on their faces. "You two thought this would frighten Harry didn't you?""Well, yeah." Crabbe shrugged.Astoria rolled her eyes and glanced at Draco. "How did they end up in Slytherin? They aren't very cunning or clever."Draco and Harry burst into laughter causing Crabbe and Goyle to leave the room with embarrassed red faces."Do you mind if I sssleeep sssome more?" The snake asked as it slithered down Harry's arm and curled itself back into Harry's bed."No, I don't mind. Are you warm enough?" Harry asked, already feeling fond of the little snake. He wasn't sure if it was a boy or girl and didn't know how to ask that question politely."Yesss.""I'm going to go ask Severus if I can keep it." Harry told Draco as he headed for the door.Astoria's mouth dropped open at the casual use of the name of their Head of House."Relax Astoria; Professor Snape is now Harry's guardian." Draco informed the first year."Really? Why? What about your relative's?" Astoria's face was full of curiosity.Harry hesitated and Draco cleared his throat. "My relative's had issues with being the guardians of a wizarding child." Harry said slowly. "It works out best this way for all of us.""Wow, Professor Snape as your guardian. That's cool Harry." Astoria beamed at him with childlike innocence. "He'll let you keep Nova right?""Nova?" Draco repeated in confusion."Harry said I could name the snake." Astoria said, gently patting the head of the sleeping snake. "He's Harry's new familiar and Nova means new in Latin." She looked at Harry eagerly. "Do you like it?"Harry chuckled. "Yes, I like it." He assured her. "Nova it is."Astoria gave a squeal of delight and bolted from the room eager to tell her friends about Nova."Well, in about five seconds everyone in the common room is going to know that Professor Snape is your guardian and that you have a snake named Nova." Draco chuckled.Harry smiled and shrugged. "That's okay, I don't mind. Now I just need to ask if I can keep Nova.""I hope you can otherwise Astoria will be devastated." Draco rolled his eyes. He gave a mean little grin. "Now I'm going to go and make sure everyone knows how weak Grabbe and Goyle were with their so called prank. Since they hang around in Zabini's group it will make all of them look lame." He rubbed his hands together gleefully and hurried out of the room.HPHPHPHP"So, I know that snakes aren't on the list of pets we are allowed to bring and that I already have Hedwig but I think this situation is a little different." Harry said hurriedly, thinking fast. He was standing in front of Snape's desk in his office as he tried to convince his guardian to let him keep the little snake. He had ended up bringing Nova with him so that Snape could see that the snake wasn't that big or dangerous in any way.Professor Snape raised an eyebrow and glanced at the snake coiled around Harry's arm before lifting his dark eyes back to his ward. "How so?"Harry took a deep breath. He couldn't be sure but he but he thought Nova had an amused look in its small eyes. He had told his new friend that he was going to try and get permission to keep it. "Um, well it gives me a chance to practice Parseltongue which is an ability I used to hate having because it made me feel like a frea-um, I mean different but having my own snake gives me an opportunity to accept the ability and –""Call it a gift." Snape said suddenly."Huh?"Snape sighed. "Parseltongue is very rare and if it has a bad stigma to it that is because of the use the Dark Lord puts it to. It is not an evil ability to have and I'm sure many are jealous of your gift.""Really?" Harry asked hesitantly. "Last year practically everyone acted like I was a dark wizard in training because of my being able to talk to snakes.""It was surprising." Snape admitted, remembering how shocked he had been last year to hear Harry talk to the snake Draco had conjured. "But anyone with any intelligence would never have believed you were a dark wizard in training Harry. Now, go on and continue." There was an amused gleam in his eyes."Right." Harry cleared his throat. "So having Nova gives me the opportunity to accept my gift and let it grow and well, don't you think that is something to be encouraged? Plus it will show all those people with no intelligence that Parseltongue is not a dark ability and that it is in fact a gift and not something to fear." He looked hopefully at Snape.Snape snorted. "Very good Harry, those are some very Slytherin reasons. No begging, pleading or crying. I approve.""Approve of my reasoning or approve of me keeping Nova?" Harry asked eagerly."Both." Snape answered, a small smile gracing his face at the happy look on his ward's face."Thank you!" Harry looked at Nova. "My guardian sssaid you can ssstay with me." He hissed."Tell him thank you from me." Nova hissed back. "You are his sssnakeling, yesss?""Um, sssort of." Harry answered quietly, not sure how to explain everything to Nova. He looked at Snape who was watching curiously. "Nova says thank you as well.""You're both welcome." Snape responded. He looked thoughtfully at Nova and took out his wand, pointing it at an empty mug on his desk. He murmured a spell and the mug transfigured into a large clear box with an opening on the top. A few more spells and it was filled with grass, dirt, and rocks. He then cast a warming charm on it. "There. Nova should be happy to sleep in there.""Brilliant!" Harry opened the top and let Nova slither in to explore. "Do you like it?" He asked."I love it." Nova responded, wiggling around in the roomy tank. "It isss very warm.""Thanks again." Harry looked gratefully at Snape. He tried to lift the tank but it was pretty heavy. He frowned.Snape chuckled and cast a feather-light charm on it. "Take it to your dorm." He instructed. "And make sure you take care of it. Keep the tank clean and make sure Nova is properly fed."Harry grinned and lifted the tank easily. "I will. See you at dinner Severus." He happily left Snape's office.It was surreal to feel so pleased that Harry was happy. Was this how parents felt? Snape sat up straight, feeling startled. Parent? He wasn't Harry's parent, he was his guardian. There was a difference. But he couldn't deny that a small part of him was seeing Harry as more than simply a ward. It was astounding how fast things could change.TBC: Hope you enjoyed this chapter! It may be a couple of weeks until the next chapter is up but I will try to post sooner if I can. =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Hope you enjoy! If you can leave a review and let me know what you think it would be very much appreciated! =)"Before we end our meeting, there are a couple of issues I would like us to discuss." Dumbledore told his staff. He clasped his hands together and peered at everyone. "First, there have been some instances of unjust treatment towards a certain House."Snape raised an eyebrow, surprised that Dumbledore was actually going to talk about it. He looked over and saw Minerva flush a little and Sinistra had crossed her arms."What do you mean Headmaster?" Sprout asked curiously."I have been hearing of unfairness towards students simply because of the House they are in." Dumbledore stated. "And I want it to stop."You've been hearing about it for years, Snape grumbled to himself. He gave a start when he saw most his colleagues looking at him somewhat smugly. He glared at them in return."My students do say you are quite unfair Severus." Professor Sprout said mildly."That is because most of your students are dunderheads who can barely tie their own shoelaces let own make a correct potion." Snape shot back."I don't really hear complaints from my students." Professor Flitwick offered. "Well, except for Mr. Page and Mr. Stratton. They do feel that they are getting unfair detentions.""Do they now?" Severus said smoothly.Remus just sat silent, shocked that Snape hadn't exploded in anger yet."You've never bin nice to "Arry but that seems to have changed." Hagrid put in."Until he is back in Gryffindor." Sinistra muttered.Snape took a deep breath. I shouldn't curse my colleagues, I shouldn't curse my colleagues, Snape chanted in his head. "I was wrong in treating Mr. Potter the way I did." He began slowly. "I will never treat him that way again, I assure you. As to Mr. Page and Mr. Stratton, they are simply getting the punishment they deserved for how they treated Mr. Potter."Professor Flitwick looked surprised. "Mr. Potter is the one who attacked them." He pointed out. "I still don't know why he would have done such a thing but I trusted that he would be reprimanded by Minerva or the Headmaster. Of course, I never imagined he would be put in Slytherin for it.""I have said that Harry being put in Slytherin was not a punishment, I don't want to have to say it again." Dumbledore said firmly. "I do not blame Harry for reacting the way he did towards your students Filius. Not now that I know -" He broke off and shook his head."Your Ravenclaws were bullying him and wouldn't leave him alone." Snape said to Filius after giving Albus a warning look. Harry would not want all the Professors knowing about his abuse.Professor Flitwick frowned. "I did not know that."Snape threw a frustrated glance at Minerva."I had meant to talk to Filius about it but got distracted when Mr. Potter got resorted." Minerva said defensively."The reason I bring this issue up is not because of how Severus treats the students." Dumbledore finally said. "The problem is how the Slytherins are treated by their Professors and peers."There was silence in the room and Snape sat back in his chair with a satisfied look on his face."What do you mean Headmaster?" Professor Sprout asked finally."There have been way too many times when a student has been treated unjustly simply because they are in Slytherin. I understand that the way of thinking is that all dark witches and wizards come from Slytherin but that is not true. A current example is Sirius Black, who was a Gryffindor." Dumbledore stood up and walked in front of his desk as he spoke. "Quirinus Quirrell who would have helped Voldemort return two years ago was a Ravenclaw. Our past Potions Professor, Horace Slughorn, was a Slytherin and to my knowledge is not a Death Eater or a dark wizard. Merlin himself was a Slytherin and he believed that wizards should help muggles and live in peace with them."The room was quiet as everyone digested Dumbledore's words. "I do not want to hear of a Professor treating the students differently based on what House they are in. It is not fair and that attitude spreads to the rest of the students. I myself fear I am guilty of acting this way." He looked at Snape apologetically. "Perhaps we should not make assumptions on anyone based on what House they are in but in the choices that they make and the lives they live." He gave a smile. "Before I dismiss you, I do have an announcement to make.""You're giving up lemon drops." Snape deadpanned, causing Remus, Minerva and Filius to snort with laughter."Perish the thought!" Dumbledore chuckled. "I am proud to announce that one of our own Professor's now has official guardianship over one of our students!"Oh Merlin, Snape thought."Who Headmaster?" Professor Sprout asked curiously."Severus is now the official guardian of Harry Potter." Dumbledore said cheerfully.Snape rolled his eyes as everyone's mouth dropped open except for Remus's and Poppy's."But…why?" Filius asked. "I mean, what about the wards around Mr. Potter's relative's house?""They proved insufficient." Dumbledore answered absently. "Harry will be much better cared for and safer with Severus.""Mr. Potter is the hero of the wizarding world! Should he really be under the guardianship of a former Death Eater?" Sinistra blurted out. Her eyes widened when she saw the dark look on Snape's face.Dumbledore's expression hardened. "Severus turned to the light and became a spy for us. I trust him completely.""Sev'rus wouldn' hurt 'Arry." Hagrid spoke up. "In fact, I think you will be a good guardian to him."Severus nodded his thanks to the gamekeeper."But I don't understand why he needs a new guardian. The protective wards around his home are quite strong." Filius spoke up."I assure you, Mr. Potter will be protected." Severus replied. "I will put up strong wards around my home in Spinner's End." I'll also have to spruce that place up, Severus thought. He had hated his own childhood in that house and rarely spent time there. But he would make sure that Harry's experience in that house was different than his own had been."As I said, his relative's proved to be insufficient and that's all I have to say about that subject. This is not to be discussed among the students although the guardianship need not be a secret." Dumbledore said. "This meeting is now adjourned. Severus, Minerva, Poppy and Remus, would you remain behind please?"Once everyone else had left, Dumbledore turned to his remaining staff. "How is Harry doing, physically and emotionally?" He asked."Physically he is a healthy thirteen year old." Poppy said briskly. "There have been no side effects from his injuries and he has gained weight. He is still a little thin but in the range of where he should be, he will most likely not be as tall as he would have been though.""That's it; I demand to know what happened." Minerva said firmly. "What happened to Mr. Potter this past summer?""It wasn't just this past summer I'm afraid." Dumbledore sighed. "I made a mistake in leaving Harry with the Dursley's. You were right that night Minerva, they are the worst sort of muggles."Minerva looked confused for a second and then her face darkened. "They hurt him."Dumbledore nodded. "That is why Harry lashed out when being bullied the beginning of this year. He had injuries we didn't know about yet as he was wearing a glamour. He was bruised all over and had internal injuries."Minerva sucked in her breath in horror and Remus looked furious."They also starved him, worked him like a house elf and when he wasn't doing chores they kept him locked up his whole childhood." The pain and regret in Dumbledore's voice was clear."I had no idea." Minerva shook her head. "How did you find out Mr. Potter was wearing a glamour?""All of my students have a check-up with Poppy." Snape spoke up. "When I found out there were no health records of him I insisted he have one. He got upset and tried to avoid it. The truth came out then.""I can't believe it." Minerva whispered. "I had no idea…I never even suspected that he was being treated cruelly at home." She narrowed her eyes. "What is being done about his relative's? They should be in Azkaban for hurting a child!""I agree." Remus said with a small growl in his voice.Dumbledore held his hand up. "Harry does not want to press charges against them. He does not want everyone to know how they treated him and we are respecting that. Besides, I believe they have been paid a visit regarding their treatment of Harry."Snape smirked as eyes turned towards him. "I merely went to get their signature.""And?" Poppy asked knowingly."And to make sure they knew how wrong their treatment of Harry was." Snape responded with a small smile.Minerva gave a small gasp. "You called him Harry!"Snape just rolled his eyes."So physically Harry is doing well. What about emotionally?" Dumbledore asked in concern.Snape hesitated. "He appears to be doing well. He has talked about his childhood a bit and I keep trying to convince him that the abuse was not his fault. I believe he is starting to accept that but it does take time. It will most likely be awhile before he truly comprehends that fact." He looked at Minerva for a second and then back to Dumbledore. "He is doing very well in Slytherin. With the new friends he has made I believe it is the right place for him to be."Remus raised his eyebrows as Minerva narrowed hers."Ah." Dumbledore nodded thoughtfully. "You think Harry should stay in Slytherin permanently?""Mr. Potter was sorted into Gryffindor." Minerva said tersely. "It was agreed after the first term he would return to Gryffindor." She looked at Snape. "You never even wanted him in your House." She couldn't help but say.Snape's expression darkened. "If he had not been resorted to my House, he would most likely be dead by now!" He hissed. "So thank goodness what I wanted or didn't want at the time was ignored. His grades are better than ever and he has a more rounded circle of friends. Why should he not stay in Slytherin? The Sorting Hat almost put him there to begin with!""It did?" Remus asked in surprise. Poppy looked thoughtful and Minerva looked like she couldn't take anymore unexpected news."It's true." Dumbledore confirmed. "The Sorting Hat did consider putting Harry into Slytherin but when he rejected it, he was then sorted into Gryffindor.""So he didn't want to be in Slytherin." Minerva said in satisfaction. "He wanted to be in Gryffindor.""I wonder what he would choose now." Poppy said, still looking thoughtful. "I can see why he would be ideal for Slytherin; most abused children learn to be cunning and resourceful to hide their abuse."Minerva looked away, guilt clearly spreading across her face."After Christmas break, we can see what the Sorting Hat has to say." Dumbledore said casually."What do you mean Albus?" Minerva asked suspiciously."We will put the Sorting Hat on Harry and see how it will sort Harry now that so much has changed. And then we will go from there." Dumbledore explained, holding out a tin of lemon drops. Remus took one while everyone else politely declined.As their meeting was clearly over, Snape made his leave and returned to his office. He had to admit, he was also curious as to what the Sorting Hat would do.HPHPHPHPSnape stalked through the hallways, glaring at all the happy and excited children. There were so many smiles and endless laughter going on. It was nauseating. Christmas break was upon them which Snape enjoyed too as it meant two weeks of fewer students around. If only all of them would go home for the break, Snape thought with a sigh. Of course, he kept an eye on any Slytherins that stayed behind and was required by Albus to attend the Christmas feast in the Great Hall. However, this year would be different for him. This year he had Harry.He knew Harry's close friends were all going home for the break and he wanted to do something to make this holiday different for the child. After much deliberation he had decided to decorate his quarters with a tree and garland. He had already bought a couple of presents for Harry and was going to make sure Harry knew he could stay in his room in their quarters during the break if he wanted to. Harry had not used it yet and it was now his home. Snape was putting off taking the child to Spinner's End as that house held only a few happy memories for him. He would have it ready by summer however. Harry deserved to have a home separate from school.It would be strange for him this year, to actually participate this Christmas holiday. Except for the feast, he usually stayed in his personal lab during the break, working on his own potions. He made himself available to his Slytherins but most of them went home and those who stayed usually kept out of trouble and did their own thing. Of course, Harry may not want to spend any of the holiday break in their quarters. Snape would understand that of course, but he wanted Harry to know he had a choice this year. This year Harry didn't have to settle for simply staying at school because he didn't want to go back to abusive relatives. This year Harry had a family that wanted him.HPHPHPHP"Come on Daffy, the train will leave without us!" Astoria said impatiently as she waited by the Hogwarts gates for her sister.Daphne threw her an exasperated look. "We have time Tori. And stop calling me Daffy!"Harry chuckled. "Maybe that could be your Christmas present to her." He told Astoria.Astoria started to giggle and then her blue eyes widened. "Did you give him our present?" She asked Daphne.Daphne nodded. "Well, actually I gave it to Professor Snape." She said. "We wouldn't want Harry opening it before Christmas right?" She winked at Astoria."Same goes." Harry said as he handed Daphne two brightly wrapped presents. He had gotten all of his friends' gifts and those that were going home for the Christmas break he had made sure to hand deliver them. He could have mailed them but he didn't know if the Slytherin parents would like that or not."Thanks Harry." Daphne put the gifts in her bag. "Have a Happy Christmas all right?" She felt bad that they were all leaving him but she figured it would be a good opportunity for him to spend time with his new guardian."I will. You too." Harry said."Come on Ronald, we'll miss the train!" Hermione hurried towards them with Ron lagging behind her."Told you we need to hurry." Astoria said triumphantly to Daphne."Goodbye Harry! Have a wonderful Christmas!" Hermione hugged him. "Thanks for cat sitting for me. Crookshanks simply acted crazy when I tried to get him in his carrier. For whatever reason, he seems to want to stay here.""Yeah no problem." Harry said easily."Make sure the kitty doesn't eat Nova." Astoria said worriedly. She had become quite fond of the snake."Kid is right to worry." Ron grumbled. "I always shared some of Christmas dinner with Scabbers. It just won't be the same without him."Hermione sighed. "I'd feel for you if I hadn't heard this ten times already. Ten times this morning!""Okay, you should all get going." Harry clapped his hands together, not wanting a fight to break out. "Draco, Theo and Tracey should be saving you spots on the train.""Bye Harry!" Astoria gave him a hug and then grabbed Daphne's hand. "Let's go.""Happy Christmas mate." Ron slapped Harry on the back as he followed Hermione, Daphne and Astoria out the gates."Happy Christmas!" Harry called after them. He watched until they disappeared down the path and then headed back to the castle. He had wanted to discuss ideas for what to get Snape for Christmas but had not gotten around to it. Snape was his guardian and had been so good to him that Harry wanted to get the man a really great present. He had no clue as to what though. He knew Snape liked books and potions of course.Harry stopped walking and a slow smile spread across his face. He had just gotten a great idea.HPHPHPHPWalking back to the dungeons, Harry ran into his guardian."Your friends have left for the train?" Snape asked as he regarded his ward. He didn't want Harry being depressed that his friends were gone.Harry nodded, his mind still on the idea for Snape's present and how he could make it work. "Yeah, just now."Snape nodded as well and cleared his throat. "You of course may stay in your dorm but I wanted to remind you that you have a room in our quarters as well.""I can stay there for the holiday break?" Harry asked hopefully. There were only a few upper Slytherins that were staying for the break and he didn't know them very well."Harry, it is your home. You can stay there anytime you would like." Snape told him seriously. Their quarters would never be off limits to Harry even when classes were in session. Harry had been denied the security of a real home practically his whole life and Snape was going to make sure he was never denied that again."I'd like that a lot." Harry said happily. "Oh, I'm looking after Hermione's cat while she is gone. Is it okay if Crookshanks stays with us?"Snape made a face. He didn't have anything against cats personally, they were much better than dogs but…he had never had a pet underfoot before. "Make sure Nova doesn't get eaten. And that cat is not allowed in my lab. You will also clean up after it.""I will." Harry promised. "Thanks Severus."HPHPHPHPOnce Harry got settled into his new room, he put both Crookshanks and Nova onto his bed. "Okay Crookshanks, this is Nova. Nova is a friend so no chasing or having snake for supper all right?"Crookshanks sniffed cautiously at Nova and then settled down next to the little snake and began purring.Harry watched with amusement, wondering why Crookshanks had hated Scabbers but not Nova. Shrugging to himself, he turned to his new pet. "Thisss isss Crookshanksss. He isss my friend'sss cat that I am taking care of. Do you think you two can get along?"Nova nudged its little head into Crookshanks orange fur. "Ssso warm. We can be friendsss." Nova hissed back.Harry smiled in relief. He was happy he wouldn't have to play referee between the two of them. He left them cuddled together and went into the sitting room. He had been beyond shocked when he had seen the Christmas tree and garland that decorated the room. The tree was a deep green yet plain. There was a box of ornaments that was sitting on the floor waiting to be hung. Harry sat on the ground and looked through the box. He was impressed with the colorful assortment. There were ornaments of brooms, snitches, books, cauldrons, and wands. There was even a red and gold lion and a green and silver snake. There was also green, silver, gold and red tinsel. Harry turned towards the fireplace it lit up and Snape walked through."Well? Are you ready to decorate?" Snape asked as he nodded towards the tree."Yes sir!" Harry stood up and picked up the first ornament. "I'll hang the snake and you can hang the lion." He grinned.Snape snorted and disappeared into the kitchen coming back out a couple minutes later with a tray of hot chocolate and biscuits. He put the tray on the coffee table and then took the lion ornament in his hands. He hung it at the top of the tree. "There. Satisfied?" He smirked.Harry laughed and hung the snake ornament next to the lion. "These are cool. Where did you get them?""Some of the ornaments I have been given over the years and some I bought recently." Snape said casually. He never decorated his quarters yet over the years his colleagues had seen fit to give him decorations. "In truth, I don't decorate. I haven't decorated a tree since I was very young." His father had not seen the use in having Christmas trees.Harry hung a golden snitch onto the tree. "This is my first time ever decorating a tree. I've always wanted to. So…thank you for this." He gave Snape a smile of true happiness and continued hanging the ornaments, not seeing the softening smile on Snape's own face as they decorated the tree together.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Hope you enjoy! =)Harry woke up feeling a heavy weight on his stomach. Blearily opening his eyes he could make out a fuzzy shaped form sleeping on him. He shifted a bit but Crookshanks made no notice and only continued to sleep. Rubbing his eyes Harry just settled back into his pillow and thought about the night before. Decorating the tree had been so fun! Snape had even added candles that would never burn out or catch fire and the tree looked amazing. They had sat back and finished their hot chocolate and biscuits and talked about simple everyday things, like school and Quidditch. Harry had even asked about the personal potion projects Snape worked on and to his surprise he had been interested in the subject of potions when Snape had answered.Today was Christmas Eve and Harry was feeling so happy and content. He was waking up in his own bed in his own room just like any other kid. At the Dursley's, even when he had been given his own room, he didn't get to enjoy any of the festivities. The only thing he got to do was clean the house and help make Christmas dinner before being sent away. He would hear his cousin shout with joy each time he opened a present and listen as his relative's laughed while they watched Dudley's favorite Christmas movies. Harry had longed to be a part of it. His first year at Hogwarts had been the first time he had received Christmas presents and had had friends to celebrate with. He had always considered Hogwarts his home and now it really was. He didn't think anything could top this Christmas. He had made some great new friends and had a guardian that actually cared about him. For the first time, Harry felt wanted and it was the best feeling in the world."Why are you sssmiling sooo much?"Harry turned his head to where Nova was looking at him lazily from the little home Snape had made."It'sss a holiday. Thisss isss the firssst one where I have a real home and family." Harry explained."What do you do on thisss holiday?" Nova asked curiously."Well, we decorate and eat sssweets, ssspend time with family and friendss, exchange presentss, and have a grand feast." Harry answered. "I'll ssshow you the tree Sssevursss and I decorated later.""The tall man in black, he treatsss hisss sssnakling well." Nova curled back up and closed its little eyes.Harry absently began scratching Crookshanks behind his ears as he pondered that. Snape was treating him well and the truth was Harry was starting to look at the man like a parent. Like a real parent. Was that okay? Yes, he was under Snape's care now but that didn't mean he saw Harry as…as a son or something. Snape would probably laugh in his face at the thought, not that Harry planned on mentioning it. But just because he wouldn't speak it didn't mean he couldn't think it. Did it?HPHPHPHPHarry and Snape were eating breakfast in the Great Hall with the small group of students and professors. They all ate at one table as Dumbledore made small talk and tried to include everyone. There were several students from each House that had stayed for the holiday break though Harry only knew the ones from Gryffindor and Slytherin. He recognized the other students but didn't know them personally. He made a mental note to take the time to get to know them during the next two weeks; he still had hope in all the Houses getting along.Harry was chatting with a fifth year Gryffindor and kept trying to ignore the stare from Trelawney. Why does she have to be here? He thought grumpily."The tree is really beautiful this year Hagrid." Professor McGonagall said as she took a sip of her tea."Aye, I made sure to grow a really nice this year." Hagrid said cheerfully. "Professor Flitwick's decoration charms are even better than last year." Professor Flitwick had done the decorating before leaving for the break to go home to his family.Harry hadn't ever thought about the fact that some of his Professor's had their own families but he had found out they take turns on who stays for the holidays and also go home on the weekends when they are able to. The ones who consistently stayed were Snape, Dumbledore, Trelawney, McGonagall and Filch."Did you drink tea Mr. Potter? I would be happy to read your tea leaves for you." Trelawney offered as she stared at him with her too wide eyes."Uh, no I didn't." Harry mumbled, embarrassed when everyone looked at him. Geez, why couldn't she just leave him alone?"No matter. I already know." Trelawney said sadly."What? What do you think you know?" Snape spoke up in a tone of ice, glaring at Trelawney over his cup of coffee."So who plans to have a snowball fight today?" Dumbledore asked loudly. He gave a warning look to Snape."The boy is in danger." Trelawney said dramatically. "I have already seen the grim in his future. It is only a matter of time before we lose him to-""Enough of your nonsense!" Snape snapped at her as he slammed his cup down."Severus." Dumbledore said yet he was frowning at Trelawney. "Sybill, I do not think this is appropriate conversation for breakfast do you?""But Albus, she is trying to warn us that Harry is in such danger." Snape said sarcastically. "Maybe he gets taken out with a snowball. Or an icicle perhaps?" He sneered at his colleague. Everyone knew that Harry was in danger; he was the boy-who-lived after all. And being part of the staff she knew Sirius Black was after Harry. The annoying seer hardly ever joined them for a meal so why was she now?"Mails here!" Hagrid interrupted hastily as several owls swooped down on them.An owl Harry didn't recognize swirled above him and then dropped a long brightly wrapped object onto Harry's lap. Harry was startled for a moment and then picked it up. He didn't see a note. Confused he opened the present and his mouth dropped open. It was a firebolt!"Wow!""Awesome!""My goodness, who sent that?" Professor McGonagall asked wide eyed.Harry shook his head. "I don't know. There was no note."Harry was too busy admiring the beautiful broom to see Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall exchange concerned glances with one another."This is the fastest broom out now!" Harry told Snape enthusiastically as he held out his new broom.Snape touched the handle with a frown. "Yes, I know. Harry, are you sure there was no note?""I'm sure." Harry said absently as he passed the Firebolt around for the other kids to see. Like him, they couldn't stop oohhing and aahhing over it. "Who do you think sent it?" He eagerly asked Snape."I'm not sure." Snape answered and the frown was still on his face. He glanced at Dumbledore. "We should talk after breakfast." He said in a low voice.Dumbledore nodded. "Meet me in my office. Minerva, you as well."Snape sighed to himself as he watched Harry examine the broom. He could tell Albus and Minerva were thinking the same thing he was thinking. What if the person who sent that broom was Sirius Black? And if it was indeed Black who sent it, it would only be to do Harry harm.HPHPHPHPAfter breakfast had finished, Harry had wanted to go try out the Firebolt but Snape had asked him to wait in their quarters first. Harry was mystified as to why and started to argue that trying out the broom would only take a few minutes but the look Snape had given him was one of his "Argue with me and you will be scrubbing cauldrons till you're forty" looks. So now Harry was in his room and instead of flying the Firebolt and sharing it with his peers he was showing it to Nova and Crookshanks. "It'sss the best broom out right now." Harry was explaining to Nova. Crookshanks had purred appreciatively at the broom. "I sometimess race Hedwig. I bet sshe won't be able to keep up with me now!""Who isss Hedwig?" Nova asked, slithering around the broom and looking at it curiously."Hedwig isss my other familiar, ssshe's an owl." Harry said and mentally reminded himself to introduce the two of them. He suddenly heard voices from the sitting room and walked in there, broom in hand. Maybe now he could fly!"Harry we need to talk." Snape said seriously."What's wrong?" Harry asked in confusion. Dumbledore and McGonagall were also in the room and they both looked serious as well. "Did something happen?""We are concerned about your new broom Mr. Potter." Professor McGonagall said grimly."Why?" Harry looked to his guardian."We do not know who sent you this broom. It is quite an expensive gift so why wouldn't the person who sent it attach a note with it? Unless, of course, that person doesn't want you to know who they are because they jinxed the broom to harm you." Snape said with a nod to the Firebolt."What? No way." Harry scoffed.Snape raised an eyebrow but it was Dumbledore who replied. "It is a possibility Harry. We would like time to have the Firebolt checked over to make sure it hasn't been jinxed or cursed in any way.""How much time?" Harry asked slowly, holding tighter to the broom."Professor Flitwick and Madame Hooch will begin to strip it down and check for –" Professor McGonagall started."Strip it down?" Harry stared at his professor as if she had gone mad. "No way!""Mind your manners Harry." Snape admonished.Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. "As I was saying, they will check for any jinxes that may have been cast on it. It should only take a few weeks once they get back from break."Weeks? "There's nothing wrong with the broom, I'm sure of it." Harry insisted, his voice shaking slightly. He had just received the most brilliant broom in the world and they were taking it away?"We need to be sure Harry." Dumbledore said kindly. "The broom could be jinxed to throw you off when you are in the sky or fly you straight to Sirius Black.""But-but we don't know who even sent it!" Harry sputtered.Snape had had enough. "That is exactly the point Harry. We do not know who sent it and it could be from someone who wishes you harm! We are not here to discuss this with you but to tell you how it is going to be. Your life is more important than that of a shiny new broomstick." He narrowed his eyes when Harry opened his mouth to protest. "You have something more to say?" He asked dangerously."There's nothing wrong with it." Harry said weakly. It would be too obvious right? Sending him a jinxed broomstick?Snape sighed exasperatedly. "You do not know that for sure Harry! The broom will be checked over, case closed." He held out his hand.Harry reluctantly handed over the Firebolt. He refused to look at any of his professors, knowing that he was acting like a child but not caring at the moment.Snape handed the Firebolt to Dumbledore. "Thank you Albus, Minerva." His tone was clearly a dismissive one as he stared at his ward, a displeased look on his face.As Dumbledore and McGonagall took their leave, Snape had to smile slightly at the way Harry shuffled his feet. He looked like a child who knew he was about to be scolded. "I'm surprised you didn't threaten to hold your breath until you got your way." He said with a touch of sternness in his tone."I wasn't throwing a tantrum." Harry mumbled. He sighed at Snape's snort. "I'm just disappointed. I mean, it's a Firebolt! I could already feel myself soaring into the air. Imagine how amazing I would be at Quidditch with it."Snape rolled his eyes and sat in his sofa chair, summoning his potion's journal. "You are already an amazing Quidditch player; you certainly don't need a Firebolt to prove that." He paused at opening his journal when Crookshanks jumped onto his lap. Snape scowled at the cat for a moment but then slowly scratched under Crookshanks chin. "Fur ball." He huffed but continued scratching the purring cat with one hand as he began to read his journal with the other. "As long as the Firebolt is deemed safe, it will be returned to you. It is really not asking much to have you wait a few weeks for a broom you did not even plan on having to begin with. Or is it?" He looked up.Harry frowned. Well, putting it that way… "No, it's not." He said finally. "I'm sorry. I still think the broom is safe though.""And I hope you are right but it is not worth risking your life over." Snape said calmly. "It is better to be sure that the broom holds no danger. As for your apology, it is accepted although I trust you will make amends to the Headmaster and Professor McGonagall as well. They, like I, are only concerned for your safety above all else."Harry nodded. "I'll apologize." He promised. "So um, what is the plan for tomorrow?"Snape set down his potions journal. "The Headmaster will be hosting Christmas breakfast and the feast. The feast we will go to, the breakfast is up to you. We can eat in the Great Hall with everyone else or here, after you open your presents. I'm holding onto several that your friends have left for you."Harry smiled. "I'd like to eat breakfast here, it that's okay." Breakfast, opening presents and just lounging around their Christmas tree sounded so…perfect.Snape inclined his head. "That is fine with me."Harry smiled and went to his room to get his cloak. "I think I'm going to see if any of the other kids want to get a snowball fight going." Harry said as he walked to the front door. He paused. "Do you want to play?" He joked.Snape merely flicked his wand and the front door opened and Harry practically flew out. Harry laughed as he landed on his feet and the door closed. "Guess not."HPHPHPHPThe next morning, Harry woke up to the wonderful smell of bacon, eggs and sausage. He quickly threw on a sweatshirt over his T-shirt and sleep pants and put on slippers. He walked to the kitchen, throwing a glance to the tree that now had brightly colored gifts scattered under it. He found Snape setting plates on the table, which held a massive amount of food. He was surprised to see Snape still in a long dark green dressing gown, as he usually was dressed for the day by breakfast.Noticing Harry's surprised look, Snape smirked. "Merry Christmas. I figure this is one morning it is acceptable to be casual."Harry grinned in response. "Merry Christmas." He looked at all the food and his stomach rumbled."I take it you would like to eat first?" Snape asked.Harry nodded. Everything looked and smelled so good! They spent the next several minutes filling their plates and digging in. "This is great, thank you Severus." Harry said as he poured himself a glass of pumpkin juice."You are welcome." Snape said as he sipped his coffee. He had put on a full English breakfast and was happy to see Harry eat with such enthusiasm. He remembered the beginning of the year after Harry's glamour had been removed and he had seen how thin the child was. Now Harry was at the correct weight and much healthier. He still felt anger whenever he remembered how battered and bruised Harry had been. He smirked to himself as he thought about the Dursley's. He doubted they were having a very happy Christmas."It appeared you had fun yesterday, if dripping from head to toe in melted snow was any indication." Snape commented.Harry grinned as he remembered the epic snowball fight that had taken place the day before. He had managed to convince all his peers to join in, which meant that students from all four houses had put aside any and all differences for awhile to enjoy the day together. It had been great. "Yeah, it was brilliant. You should have played. Of course, you probably would have been everyone's target." He snickered."A frightening thought indeed." Snape rolled his eyes. "I assure you, I would have been able to handle it."Harry shrugged. "If you say so, sir." He teased as he took his last bite of breakfast.Snape waved his wand sending the empty dishes to the sink. "Let's head into the sitting room. Unless you are too full to open presents.""No way!" Harry bolted up and ran into the other room. He ignored Snape's chuckling as he sat by the tree. He didn't care that he was as excited as a five year old would be on Christmas morning. This was the first Christmas he remembered having with a family of his own and he was determined to enjoy every minute of it.HPHPHPHPHarry rummaged under the tree and pulled out two presents that were for him and Snape. "These are from Dumbledore." Harry handed one to Snape and then opened his. "Socks." He grinned slightly as he thought about first year, when Dumbledore had told him he saw himself getting socks in the Mirror of Erised. The socks Harry was holding were maroon and green with little lions and snakes chasing each other. He burst out laughing when he saw Snape holding up his own pair of socks."Merlin, I do believe that man gets more senile every year." Snape stared distastefully at the black and green socks with silver cauldrons moving around."What did you get him?" Harry asked as he pulled out another present."The potion of sanity, only time will tell if it works." Snape deadpanned.Harry snickered as he handed Snape several presents sent by his colleagues while Harry settled into his own pile sent by his friends. "A Weasley sweater!" He grinned and held up a maroon and gold jumper with a big H sewn into it. He saw another one in the box. "Oh, she made me one in Slytherin colors too." Harry said as he pulled a green and silver jumper out. His heart warmed as he thought about Mrs. Weasley making him two jumpers for both of his Houses."Yes, she is most generous." Snape held up his own jumper with a big S on it. He was looking at it warily.Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing. "It will go well with the socks." He offered. "Think of how stylish you will be!" He regretted his joke when a second later he was covered with wrapping paper. "Hey!""Cheekiness has a price." Snape smirked as Harry shook off all the paper.They continued opening gifts and Harry was touched by his friends' thoughtful presents. Quidditch posters from Ron, a homework planner from Hermione, latest Quidditch book from Daphne, a drawing of him and Nova from Astoria, Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans from Tracey, joke products from Theo and tickets to a Quidditch game from Draco. According to Draco's note he had bought everyone a ticket so they could all go together in the spring. Harry was overwhelmed by it all.Harry opened a card that was from Snape and it contained gift certificates to The Three Broomsticks, Honeydukes and Gladrags. There was one present left that also was from Snape. "Brilliant!" Harry cried after he opened the gift. It was a Wizards Hover Board! It was like a muggle skateboard but without wheels. Harry and Ron had looked at it when they had been getting their books during the summer. Harry knew it was expensive and he couldn't believe Snape had gotten him one. "I love it! Thank you so much!""You are welcome." Snape said with a satisfied look. "Although it's no Firebolt…" He smirked. He had secretly been nervous that he would mess up on making this Christmas a good one for Harry but the child looked quite happy so far."No, this is amazing. This is the best thing ever!" Harry said sincerely. "Can I try it out later today?" He grinned when Snape nodded.Now that the gifts were all opened, Harry turned to Snape. "I have something for you but it can't be wrapped. We have to go to it." He said a little nervously. He hoped Snape didn't think his idea was a dumb one, especially since he hadn't actually bought anything. Well, he had bought a couple of vials and a bag so Snape could fill them if he wanted to.Snape raised an eyebrow. "You needn't have gotten me anything although I am intrigued. Would you like to go now?"Harry nodded. He carried his gifts to his room and quickly changed into jeans and shoes, keeping the sweatshirt on. He grabbed the things he needed, thankful that Snape had taught him the shrinking charm. He went back out and waited for Snape, still feeling anxious about his gift idea."Where are we going?" Snape asked as he followed Harry through the dungeon halls a moment later."Um, you'll see." Harry responded as he led Snape to the first floor girl' lavatory. When they entered, he turned nervously to Snape. "Here we are."Snape looked at him incredulously. "Here? Is this some sort of joke?"Harry shook his head and went over to the sinks. Focusing on the tap with a snake on the side, he hissed "open" and the sink sank out of sight and revealed a large pipe. He almost laughed at the shocked look on Snape's face. "Welcome to the entrance of the Chamber of Secrets."TBC: Please review if you get a chance!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for all of the reviews! =)"The Chamber of Secrets?" Snape repeated, his eyes widening. He remembered Albus telling him that Harry had stumbled upon the chamber and had only just managed to escape with his life as well as the life of Miss. Weasley. Albus had not gone into specifics, only saying that the monster had been a Basilisk and had been dealt with."Yeah." Harry gestured to the large pipe. "The Basilisk is dead now but it is still down there. Dumbledore said no one would be able to go down to the Chamber unless they speak Parseltongue, so I thought maybe you could use parts of the Basilisk for potion ingredients. I read that they were rare, the venom and skin so…" Harry trailed off nervously.Snape stared at him for a moment. "Yes, Basilisk parts are very rare and something I would very much like to possess." He'd thought of that when Albus had first mentioned the creature but he'd assumed that the Headmaster had closed off the Chamber for good. "This is wonderful Harry, thank you."Harry smiled in relief. "You're welcome. I bought some vials and a knapsack for you to collect ingredients in."Snape was touched. Harry had obviously put a lot of thought into this and having Basilisk parts was a Potion Master's dream come true. "So exactly how do we get in there?" He asked, eyeing the pipe.Harry grinned. "Follow me!" He jumped down the pipe, laughing as he slid down. He could hear Snape calling frantically after him.Several moments after Harry had landed he heard Snape muttering to himself as he landed with a loud crunch from the bones beneath them."Don't do that again!" Snape glowered as he cast a lumos. Although his voice sounded irritated, his eyes showed interest as he looked around."Sorry." Harry held back a laugh. "Didn't you enjoy the ride down?""Not particularly." Snape muttered."Oh." Harry's face fell as he saw the small opening from the stones that had collapsed from Lockhart's spell backfiring. He recalled that it had been a tight fit last year and he was a little bigger since then. "Do you think we will be able to fit through that? I forgot about the cave in."Snape paused. Cave in? What exactly had happened down here last year? He flicked his wand and the stones began moving."Oh right." Harry said as he watched the magic push away the stones. Duh.As they walked through Snape stopped every once in awhile to pick up the shredded Basilisk skin. Harry handed him the black and green knapsack that he had bought. "Here you go.""Thank you Harry." Snape said as he shifted through the skins.When they came to the door with the snake on it, Harry hissed for it to open. As they walked in, Harry couldn't help but gulp at the sight of the dead Basilisk. He had forgotten how big it was. Or maybe he had simply blocked it out.Snape's eyes widened as he circled the large creature. It is one thing to read about them but to see one… He couldn't believe Harry had come in contact with this snake. "Exactly what happened down here?"Harry shrugged. "It came after me and I killed it, though I had help from Fawkes. Tom was pretty mad about that. Of course, he cheered up when he thought I was going to die from the venom."Snape's heart almost stopped at hearing that. Apparently, Albus had left out quite a few details. "I want you to tell me everything." He commanded as he began draining the venom from a Basilisk fang into one of the vials Harry had given him. He continued his dissection as Harry told him about him and his friends finding the chamber, making Lockhart go with them, how the fraud's memory charm had backfired, Tom Riddle coming out of the diary and setting the snake on him. When Harry spoke of how he had almost died from the venom and that Fawkes had healed him, Snape stopped what he was doing and stared at his ward.Merlin, how did I not know about this? How did I not know about everything? Snape wondered, angry at himself. He was supposed to have been protecting Harry, even back then when he didn't like him. He couldn't wrap his head around the image of Harry fighting The Dark Lord and the Basilisk. It made him sick to think how close Harry had come to death. He had been abused at home and almost killed at school. Has the child ever felt safe? He wondered sadly."Severus?" Harry asked in a worried tone. His guardian was just staring at him and Harry wondered if he was okay. He was shocked when Snape suddenly stepped forward and pulled him into a brief hug."You are just a child." Snape muttered above Harry's head. "You've dealt with too much for one your age.""I'm okay." Harry said as he relaxed into the hug. The only other parental type hug he could remember getting was from Mrs. Weasley and Harry had to admit it felt good. He would have never believed Snape could be so fatherly but he really was pretty good at it.Snape pulled back, a little surprised himself at letting his emotions show. He wasn't used to that happening as he usually kept himself closed off from anyone. This child had changed all of that. "Anything like the chamber or sorcerer's stone happens again you come to me. Anything that makes you think there is danger around, you come to me. Understood?"Harry nodded, feeling touched at the clear concern and protectiveness he could see on Snape's face. "I will. No more dangerous missions for me." He joked. "No more chasing stones, fighting Basilisks, running from Acromantula's – ""Excuse me?" Snape's mouth dropped open."Uh, maybe we'll save that story for New Year's." Harry said hastily. He looked back to the Basilisk and noticed a fang separate from the creature's body. He knew that fang; it still was stained with his blood. While Snape was putting his full vials into the knapsack Harry picked it up."Did you want to keep it?" Snape asked, suddenly standing beside him. He noticed the stained blood and took a deep breath to compose himself.Harry shrugged. "I guess it would be stupid to. I mean, I almost died from it.""You survived." Snape pointed out. "You have an incredible strong spirit Harry, a survivor is what you are. I don't see anything wrong with keeping it as a memento."Harry pocketed the fang and grinned at Snape. "So did you get all the ingredients that you want?""More than enough to keep me busy for quite awhile." Snape said somewhat gleefully. Not only would he be able to use these for his own personal potions but he would be able to sell some of it as well. This truly was one of the kindest gestures that anyone had ever done for him.They walked back the way they came and Snape frowned slightly when they reached the pipe. "Wait, you said you got out of here because Fawkes carried you out correct?""Yup." Harry took two small school brooms out of his pocket. "Here you go." He restored them to their original size and handed one to Snape.Snape sighed as he mounted the broom. Flying had never interested him, even as a child. Harry took off first, letting out a loud whoop of joy as he sped through the pipe. Snape grumpily followed and when he landed on the bathroom floor, he saw Harry still flying around doing turns and flips. "All right Harry, you can land now." He said dryly. There was suddenly a wail that filled the bathroom."What are you two doing in here?" A whiney voice asked as Harry finally landed on the floor. Moaning Myrtle was floating above them with a scowl on her face."Oh, hey Myrtle. Um, Merry Christmas." Harry winced. That was probably insensitive, given that Myrtle couldn't exactly celebrate.Instead of crying like she was prone to do, Myrtle smiled. "Why thank you Harry." She simpered. "You always were a polite boy. My offer is still open for you to share my toilet you know." She looked at him hopefully."Right, thanks." Harry coughed, glaring at Snape's snort of laughter."Gee as beautiful as this moment is, we need to be going." Snape smirked. "You may continue your insufferable wailing now."Myrtle gasped and dove into the toilet with a cry."Hmm, I guess you two won't be friends." Harry chuckled as they walked back to the dungeons."My heart breaks." Snape responded with an eye roll.When they entered their quarters Snape immediately went to his private lab to put his new ingredients away. Harry went and grabbed his hover board and sat on the sofa in the sitting room as he looked it over. It was green, gold, and black and Harry couldn't wait to try it out.When Snape came back out they had a light lunch as the Christmas Feast would be overflowing with food. After they were done eating, Snape asked if Harry wanted to go outside and try his gift out."Yeah definitely!" Harry grabbed his board and practically ran out of their quarters, Snape chuckling behind him as he followed.HPHPHPHPA couple of days after Christmas, Harry was out on the Quidditch pitch flying on his hover board. It felt like being on a broom but only standing up and he loved it. He was experimenting with doing spins and loops with Hagrid watching and cheering him on. When he landed Hagrid began clapping."That was amazing 'Arry!" Hagrid grinned. "Flyin' is in your blood, that's fer sure."Harry grinned in response. "Thanks Hagrid! Um, has there been any news about Buckbeak?"Hagrid's face fell. "The ministry sent me a letter that they are going to execute him." Hagrid said sadly, tears filling his eyes.Harry's own eyes widened. "What? When?""Before the Christmas break is over." Hagrid wiped his eyes. "I didn' want to ruin your holiday by telling you.""Hagrid, I'm so sorry." Harry said with a shake of his head. Stupid Zabini! There had to be a way to stop the execution. He would write to his friends for ideas tonight. They had already done some research in the library but Harry would try again. Apparently their letters to the ministry detailing what had happened had made no difference.After Hagrid changed the subject and offered Harry some pumpkin juice in his hut he began to follow but a movement by the forest caught his eye and he squinted. It was that black stray dog, watching him. He hesitated and then began walking towards it. "Hey there." He said soothingly.The dog's ears perked up and its tail began wagging.Harry reached his hand out slowly and patted the dogs head. "Are you lost? Do you need help finding your way back home?"The dog whined and Harry was sure he could see sadness in its eyes. Harry frowned as he scratched behind the animal's ears. The dog must have been lost from his owners for awhile, he was pretty scrawny. "I bet Hagrid will feed you." He said aloud.The dog whined again and walked back into the forest.Harry sighed. The poor thing was probably scared of people and Harry didn't want to frighten the dog off, not when he looked so hungry. "I'll bring you something to eat. Just…stay. Stay." Harry repeated as he slowly walked away. He would get the dog some food; after all he knew what it was like to be hungry.Harry told Hagrid about the stray and was given a big bowl of food as well as a bowl of water. After being cautioned by Hagrid to be careful around an unknown dog, Harry took the food and water back to the edge of the forest, aware that Hagrid was keeping an eye on him from his hut."Here you go." Harry said softly, putting the bowls down. The dog sniffed briefly at the food before digging in."I wish I could keep you. I doubt Snape would allow it though." Severus, Harry reminded himself. It was still weird to him to call his guardian by his first name. Besides, how many kids called their paren- guardians by their first name?The dog looked up and began growling. Harry looked at it in surprise, wondering what had upset the animal. "Go on, eat." He coaxed.As Harry watched, he remembered Remus mentioning to stay away from the stray and tell him if he saw it again. Harry figured that Remus just wanted to help the animal but Hagrid had said he would put food out for the dog and would make inquiries about it so Harry dismissed the thought of telling his Professor. After all, it was just a dog.HPHPHPHPSnape found Harry sitting on the floor in their sitting room surrounded by books. "Don't tell me you are doing homework during the holiday break?" He asked in surprise."Nope." Harry answered as he wrote on a piece of parchment."Thank Merlin; I don't think my heart would take such a shock." Snape looked at the books curiously. "What exactly are you doing then?""Hagrid told me Buckbeak is getting executed before the break is finished." Harry sighed. "I was hoping to find something to stop it.""Ah, I see." Snape frowned. "I'm sorry about Buckbeak. I wish there was something I could do. I know the Headmaster spoke on his behalf.""We also sent letters." Harry said in frustration. "We are eyewitnesses to what happened and they still want to kill Buckbeak!""Unfortunately, money and power mean more to some than the truth." Snape said regretfully. "And the Zabini's have plenty of both. The Headmaster is still trying to help however." He paused. "All of your friends sent letters?"Harry nodded. "Yeah, with both Gryffindors and Slytherins agreeing on what really happened, you'd think the ministry would take notice.""Hmm." Snape said in thought. He knew most of the Slytherin parents wouldn't care about Hagrid or the Hippogriff but if they thought the ministry was dismissing their children's testimony…Or if they thought the ministry was implying that their children were lying…Hmm…Harry bit his lip in frustration as he continued looking through the books he had borrowed from the library. He didn't notice the scheming look on Snape's face or the way the Potions Master summoned a quill and parchment and began writing.HPHPHPHP Harry was waiting patiently at the entrance of the castle, per his guardians instructions. He had no idea why Snape wanted him to wait here. Leaning against the doorway Harry debated whether to go to the forest and quickly check on the stray dog. He wanted to know if it was still hanging around. He was about to head over there when he heard someone shout his name. Looking down the path he saw Daphne, Draco and Ron hurrying towards him.Harry's mouth dropped open. "What are you guys doing here?""We came back early!" Daphne beamed."We couldn't leave you alone the whole break, who knows what you would get into?" Draco smirked."I just didn't want to go to Aunt Muriel's house for the rest of the holiday." Ron said, slapping Harry on the back. "It's good to see you mate. How was your Christmas?""Brilliant." Harry grinned, now realizing Snape would have known they were coming. "Thanks for your gifts, I loved them.""I fell over in shock over Malfoy's gift." Ron admitted."They're just tickets." Draco shrugged though there was a smug look in his eyes."Amazing tickets! The twins and Ginny were so jealous!" Ron said gleefully."We'll get them souvenirs." Harry laughed. "It's going to be brilliant!""What did Professor Snape get you?" Daphne asked curiously."Gift certificates and a hover board." Harry answered with a grin."A hover board? Can I try it out? Please?" Ron practically begged."You're lucky." Draco grumbled. "I wanted one but my Mum thought it was too dangerous. You already have a fine broom if you want to fly." He mimicked in a high pitched voice."Well, Severus put safety features on it." Harry said. "And I'm not allowed to use it unless someone is with me in case I get hurt.""I want to try it out too." Daphne said eagerly."Sure. I'll go get it. Some of the kids who stayed here have been using it too." Harry said as he began to turn away. "It definitely took the attention away from the Firebolt issue which was fine with me.""What Firebolt issue?" Daphne questioned."Oh." Harry forgot they didn't know about that. "I received a Firebolt right before Christmas.""What!" Ron's eyes bugged out. "Where is it? Can I fly it? Who gave it to you? Blimey, you got a Firebolt and a hover board? Why are you always so lucky?" His tone held a tinge of jealousy."Relax Ron. I received a Firebolt but I don't get to have it yet." Harry said quietly. "No one knows who sent it so it has to be thoroughly tested and that may take several weeks. The adults think someone who wishes me harm may have sent it.""Sirius Black." Daphne breathed.Harry nodded. "I doubt it was sent by him but there was no convincing Severus or the Headmaster." He saw that Ron still had a disgruntled look on his face. He hated when Ron acted jealous of him as he didn't understand why. The truth was Harry had been jealous of Ron since the first day they met, with him having a family that cared for him and loved him. "I'll get the hover board so you can ride it okay? I'll be right back."Once Harry was out of sight, Daphne glared at Ron and Draco shoved him. "Hey! What did I do?" Ron complained."You really don't know?" Daphne huffed with her arms crossed."You're making Harry feel guilty when something good happens to him." Draco told Ron with a scowl. "After everything that has happened to him this year, don't you think he deserves some good?""I - " Ron's shoulders dropped when he realized how he had acted. He had always struggled with jealousy; it was one of his worst traits. Harry had been abused, had never had a real family until now, and had had to adjust to living in a new House. "You're right." He said finally. Man, if Hermione was here she would have hexed him into next week."Good. And since you acted like a prat, you get to try the hover board last." Draco smirked.Ron simply rolled his eyes and Daphne giggled."Here it is." Harry returned a moment later, holding up the sleek looking board. He laughed when Draco whisked it out of his hands and immediately jumped on it, flying into the air."Awesome!" Draco cried as he began practicing some turns and twists.Ron stood next to Harry as they watched. "I'm sorry." Ron said softly.Harry knew what Ron was referring to and he simply patted his friend on the back. "It's okay. Don't worry about it."Ron nodded. "So do you think the Firebolt was sent to you to hurt you?""No idea. I don't think so only because it would be too obvious you know? If someone sent it to hurt me, they would have to think that it would be looked over right?" Harry asked. He paused. "Although, that's probably why Flitwick and Hooch are going to be so in-depth in their checking of the Firebolt. McGonagall said they will strip it down and-""Strip it?" Ron gasped. "They'll ruin it!""Yeah, that's what I thought too. But I've been assured that it will be returned to me in perfect condition as long as it hasn't been cursed or hexed in any way. Maybe whoever sent it didn't think they would do such a deep inspection of it." Harry shrugged. "Who knows? Time will tell, I guess.""This is so much fun!" Daphne squealed as she took her turn with the board.Ron was on his turn when Harry saw Snape watching them from the edge of the pitch. He ran over to his guardian. "You knew they were coming!" He grinned."Of course I did." Snape smirked. "They wrote asking if they could come back early and I figured you would enjoy your break more with them here."Harry tilted his head to the side. "I'm so happy they are here. But my break has been going perfectly Severus. Honestly. This has been the best Christmas holiday ever, thanks to you."Snape felt a rush of warmth spread through him. Stupid emotions, he grumbled to himself. "It's getting quite chilly so I want all of you to come inside soon." He paused. "Is that a dog barking?'Harry turned towards the direction of the forest. "There is a stray that has been hanging around. Hagrid is giving it food and trying to find it a home." He looked at Snape hopefully."No." Snape said immediately, knowing what Harry was hinting at.Harry laughed as Snape went back inside the castle. Well, there was no harm in asking."Come on Harry!"Harry looked to his friends and went to join them, quickly taking his turn with the board before they all went back inside for the day.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you for your reviews and encouragement! Hope you enjoy this chapter!"So what did you get Hermione for Christmas?" Harry asked Ron as they ate dinner with everyone in the Great Hall.Ron smirked. "A cute, fluffy stuffed animal. Of a rat." His smirk faded. "Unfortunately, it appears Hermione knows me too well. She got me a stuffed orange cat."Harry began laughing. "You two really need to give it a rest with that.""How can you say that? Crookshanks killed Scabbers!" Ron protested. He narrowed his blue eyes. "Wait, you're taking care of Crookshanks for her aren't you?" There was a gleam in his eyes."Yes and he hasn't once tried to hurt Nova. In fact they get along very well." Harry told his friend. "And no, you may not hurt Crookshanks.""I wasn't going to hurt him." Ron said innocently."Yeah right." Harry scoffed. He noticed Draco looking at Ron thoughtfully.Ron noticed as well. "What?""I'm just wondering if I am powerful enough to obliviate you with any memories about Scabbers." Draco shrugged. "Without destroying your mind that is. I bet I could.""Don't you dare Malfoy!" Ron hissed."Do not fret Mr. Weasley. Mr. Malfoy would not risk getting expelled for something as frivolous as erasing a memory of a rat." Snape drawled, overhearing their conversation."But he won't shut up about it. It's annoying." Draco whined."Hmm, you do have a point." Snape mused as he took a sip of his coffee.Ron's eyes widened."There will be no need to obliviate anyone." Dumbledore said from across the table. He eyed Snape and Draco and then turned kind eyes on Ron. "I am very sorry for the loss of your familiar Ronald.""Thank you Headmaster." Ron said with a smug look to Draco."He may not even be dead, there was no body found." Harry said reasonably as he took a bite of his mashed potatoes."Of course there wasn't, Crookshanks ate him!" Ron said in frustration, slamming his fork down."Yeah but you'd think that there would be pieces of him or-" Harry started to say."Ew, enough! I won't be able to finish my dinner." Daphne glared at her friends. "No more talk of rats during mealtimes okay?""I concur with that." Professor McGonagall said, eyeing the boys sternly.Harry stifled a laugh as he set some chicken aside on a napkin."You do know that you can eat anytime you are hungry?" Snape asked, only half joking. For a boy that had been starved on a regular basis it would be understandable for Harry to want to keep food with him."Yeah I know." Harry said easily. "This is for the stray dog."Remus, who had been quietly eating his meal, looked at Harry sharply. "You saw that dog again? Have you been going near it?" His tone was uncharacteristically sharp and everyone at the table looked at him warily."What do you care?" Snape asked suspiciously. "I would think you would feel for the poor beast." He smirked as he went back to his coffee. He ignored the warning look Dumbledore gave him."The stray is friendly, jus' shy." Hagrid put in. "Fang seems to like him enough and I've seen that orange cat visit him."Harry was surprised. He did let Crookshanks out to wander as Hermione had told him that Crookshanks always came back. He didn't know that the cat had visited the stray dog though. He began chuckling as a thought occurred to him."What?" Daphne asked curiously."Well, first Crookshanks gets along with Nova and now some stray dog. Yet, not your rat." Harry grinned at Ron."Hilarious Harry." Ron mumbled as he picked up his fork and began eating again.Remus looked uncertain. "I simply think Harry should be careful around an unknown animal. You never know if it could turn vicious." He said slowly."I do agree with you there Lupin." Snape said, staring at his colleague. "Some animals can certainly be dangerous.""Severus." Minerva murmured.Remus paled slightly and pushed his chair back. "Yes, exactly right. Excuse me please, I am no longer hungry." He walked away.Harry looked after him in confusion while Daphne looked contemplative."What was that about?" He whispered to her."Don't know for sure." Daphne shrugged yet her eyes remained thoughtful.HPHPHPHPAfter dinner Harry and his friends were deciding what to when Draco mentioned night flying.Daphne frowned. "I doubt we would be allowed to. It can be dangerous.""So? It's fun." Draco countered."I've done it, it is fun." Ron agreed. "Though it wasn't fun when my Mum caught the twins and I when we were younger." He winced in memory."It sounds good to me. I haven't tried the Hover Board out at night." Harry grinned.Daphne bit her lip. "Well, I suppose we could cast a lot of cushioning charms under us. But Harry, aren't you supposed to have an adult outside with you?""He will. Hagrid is likely in his hut which is outside of this castle." Draco said smugly.Harry wondered if Hagrid would be okay with them flying at night. He doubted Severus would be but still, it was just flying. "Maybe I should ask Severus?" He ventured.Draco and Daphne snorted. "He will say no. Graham wanted to have practices at night once and was told it was out of the question." Draco rolled his eyes."Well, I bet Hagrid would keep an eye on us if he thought we had permission." Daphne mused. She caught the surprised look Harry was giving her and grinned. "I told you I'm not a complete goody-goody.""And classes aren't in session so we can't have points taken away or be given detention." Ron said enthusiastically.Harry wavered. He didn't want to make Severus mad but it sounded like fun. What real harm could come from it? "Let's do it. But only for a little while. I have a feeling Severus won't care about classes not being in session, we will be cleaning cauldrons from dawn to dusk if he finds out."Ron shrugged. "So we make sure Snape doesn't find out. Come on, let's go!"Trying to be as stealthy as possible, they each got their brooms and Harry also grabbed his board as well as his invisibility cloak. Severus wasn't in their quarters which Harry was grateful for. He didn't think he could outright lie to the man anymore. Throwing the cloak over him he found his friends waiting just outside the castle."Geez, how long can Harry take?" Draco complained, not aware that Harry was standing right next to him."I hope Professor Snape didn't catch him." Daphne said nervously.Suddenly Draco gave a yelp as something grabbed his broom from him. The three teenagers watched in shock as Draco's broom began flying to the Quidditch Pitch.Realization dawned in Ron's eyes and he began laughing. "I think Harry is here.""Potter that was not funny!" Draco yelled as he ran to the pitch, Ron and Daphne following and laughing. "Merlin, I almost had a heart attack." Draco muttered as Harry pulled off the cloak and dropped it on Draco's head while he flew about him.Harry grinned and tossed Draco the Hover Board. "Does that make up for it?"Draco's face lit up and he hopped on the board. "I suppose I can find it in my heart to forgive you." He quickly soared into the air.Ron and Daphne got on their brooms and soon all of them were in the sky. Harry was enjoying the thrill of flying in the crisp air. They hadn't cast any cushioning charms but the ground below was a snowy blanket so he figured they would be all right.As he was flying he noticed something going on by Hagrid's hut. He paused in the air and could make out Hagrid and Dumbledore standing outside. There were two more people. One of them looked like…Minister Fudge! Which meant…Harry landed, motioning for his friends to join him. "I can't believe it; they are going to execute Buckbeak tonight!" He hissed. He felt his hatred for Fudge intensify."What? No!" Daphne gasped."I can't believe that idiot Fudge is going through with it!" Draco glared in the direction of Minister."Poor Hagrid." Ron said softly. A movement on the ground caught his eye and he stepped away from the group."That must be the executioner." Daphne said in disgust as they continued watching. "I don't want to see this." She turned her head away and Harry put his arm around her."It looks like Professor Dumbledore is talking pretty adamantly." Draco observed."Fudge doesn't look very happy." Harry said, perplexed."Oi!""Ron?" Harry turned around. His eyes went wide when he saw what Ron was holding. "Is that Scabbers?"Ron was halfway up the hill. "It is! He's still alive after all! This fur ball was about to attack him!"Harry looked down. "Crookshanks?""You owe Hermione an apology now." Daphne pointed out as she, Harry and Draco walked up to join Ron."Maybe, but her cat is still trying to…Ahh!""Ron!" Harry yelled in shock. The stray dog from the forest suddenly ran up and was snarling as it grabbed Ron's leg and began dragging him away. Ron shrieked in pain and panic."No, let him go!" Harry called out as he followed. "Bad dog!" Before Harry could reach his friend the dog dragged Ron, who was still holding onto Scabbers, into the Whomping Willow."Harry watch out!" Daphne pushed him out of the way right before a tree branch swung right where Harry had been standing.Draco narrowly dodged a branch as well. "This bloody tree is trying to kill us!"The three teens stood away from the Whomping Willow, looking on helplessly. "We need to get an adult." Daphne said in concern."Wait, look!" Draco pointed to Crookshanks who slipped through and easily dodged the branches, putting his paw on a knot at the base of the tree. The Whomping Willow froze."Brilliant." Draco breathed."How in the world did Crookshanks know to do that?" Daphne wondered out loud."He's friends with the dog. Hagrid mentioned that earlier." Harry led the way through the tunnel and soon they found themselves in the Shrieking Shack. They heard a crash upstairs and after a brief glance at each other, they headed upstairs with their wands at the ready. They entered a bedroom and found Ron huddled in the corner, one hand still holding a wiggling Scabbers and the other holding his leg which was bleeding."Harry, it's a trap! He's an Animagus!" Ron yelled.Harry turned, his eyes following the paw prints on the floor that turned into…He raised his eyes to see a tall, thin man with straggly hair staring back at him. Sirius Black! Before he could move, Sirius disarmed him and easily grabbed his wand."Stay away from Harry!" Ron yelled, trying to get up and falling back down as he winced in pain."You're not getting to him." Daphne said determinedly, though fear shown clearly through her eyes."You'll, you'll have to go kill us first!" Draco added as he trained his wand on Black along with Daphne.Sirius continued to stare and then broke into a raspy loud laughter. "No, no. Only one needs to die tonight. Only one, only one…" He chanted."He's completely barmy!" Ron shook his head.Harry felt a surge of anger and lunged himself at Black. "Murderer!" Harry shouted out as he pushed at Black, kicking him hard in the shin. He managed to get a hold of his wand and stepped back and held the convict at wand point.Sirius turned his wild grey eyes onto Harry as he rubbed his shin, still snickering. "You are going to kill me Harry?" His laughter continued."Yes!" Harry yelled as he thought about his parents. "Although, being returned to the Dementors is probably worse isn't it?" He spit out hatefully.Sirius stopped laughing and stared at Harry. "You need to listen to me." He urged suddenly. There were footsteps rapidly approaching and everyone turned towards the door."Professor!" Harry said in relief as Professor Lupin entered the room.Remus ignored him and kept his gaze on Black. "You don't look well Sirius." He said in an amused tone. "You finally have showed everyone how mad you truly are."Sirius raised an eyebrow. "Well, you would know about the madness within wouldn't you Remus?"To everyone's shock, Remus stepped forward and pulled Sirius into a friendly hug!"What – what are you doing?" Harry asked in shock. This couldn't be happening!Daphne gasped. "Hermione and I covered for you! He's a werewolf Harry! That's why he takes that potion and misses classes. We figured it out weeks ago but didn't say anything." She glared at Remus. "You've been helping him!" She gestured to Sirius.Sirius began laughing again as Remus turned to Daphne. "I'm impressed. You two are the brightest witches of your age I believe.""She's as bright as a star and you howl at the moon." Sirius shook Remus's arm. "He's here! We can kill him now. Or I can just do it myself!" Sirius said gleefully."Wait Sirius-""I've done my waiting!" Sirius snarled and his dirty face darkened. "Twelve years I have waited! Do you have any idea what it was like there?" He asked desperately.Remus paused and then nodded slowly. "Okay Sirius.""No!" Harry raised his wand along with Draco and Daphne. Once again Harry's wand sailed out of his hands.Harry glared at Remus as the Defense Professor grabbed his wand and then Harry turned murderous eyes onto Sirius. "I hate you!" He hissed. "You betrayed my parents. They trusted you!""I would never betray James and Lily!" Sirius responded heatedly. "Never!""Harry, you need to listen to us –" Remus began. He held a hand up as Draco and Daphne stepped closer with their wands out. "Please wait, just listen to us first." He said calmly."I've listened! I've listened to my Mum and Dad as they died!" Harry said furiously. "I've heard my Mum screaming and begging for my life!"Sirius's eyes widened with horror. "You've heard them? Oh Harry, I wish I had been there that night. I would have helped them!""The person who betrayed your parents is indeed in this room but it was not Sirius." Remus told Harry. "It was someone who we all believed to be dead.""They're both insane." Draco scoffed. He and Daphne still had their wands trained on Remus and Sirius."So then, who betrayed my parents if it wasn't you?" Harry asked bitterly. "Because I don't see anyone else here!""He's there!" Sirius pointed to where Ron was sitting.Ron looked startled. "Me?""No not you!" Sirius snapped impatiently.Harry followed Black's glaze realized he wasn't looking at Ron. He was looking at Scabbers who was wriggling around like mad in Ron's hand.Harry exchanged confused glances with Daphne and Draco."Ready? One, two – " Remus began as he handed Sirius Harry's wand and they focused on Scabbers."Expelliarmus!"Harry felt a sense of relief as his guardian stalked through the door. Snape pocketed Remus's wand and after studying the other wand, he handed it to Harry. "Are you okay?" He asked though he didn't take his dark eyes off of Sirius and Remus."Yeah. Ron's hurt though." Harry answered quickly. "Sirius is an Animagus. He's the dog I've been seeing." Harry narrowed his eyes in thought. "You knew didn't you?" He accused Remus.Remus flushed. "Harry I- yes I suspected-""Yet you failed to mention it?" Snape cut in harshly. "You didn't feel the need to tell the Headmaster of his ability?""I-" Remus looked guilty."Sod off Snivellus!" Sirius barked a laugh. "This is just like the old times, you sneaking around trying to cause trouble. How did you even know we were here?""I went to Lupin's office to drop off his potion and saw his name move beyond the edge of a very interesting map." Snape answered as he glared at Sirius hatefully. "Of course, I never trusted Lupin so I came to see what he was up to. Needless to say, I'm not surprised at all to see him here helping you!""Still so pathetic, aren't you Snivellus?" Sirius returned the heated glare."Shut up!" Harry glared at the man who had been named his godfather."Harry…" Sirius said, his tone softening."Stop!" Remus yelled in exasperation. "Why don't we deal with Pettigrew first?""Pettigrew is dead!" Harry protested.Snape raised an eyebrow. "Pettigrew? What are you talking about?" He followed Sirius's and Remus's gazes that fell on the rat in Ron's hand. Surprise flickered across his face. "Are you saying Pettigrew is an Animagus as well?" He asked incredulously."Yes." Remus nodded seriously."This is Scabbers. He's been in my family for years!" Ron spoke up. His voice was laced with fear and pain."Twelve years perhaps? Rather a long life for a rat, wouldn't you say?" Sirius asked sarcastically. "And I bet he is missing a toe?""All they could find of Pettigrew was his finger." Harry whispered. Could it be?Ron gave a yelp as Scabbers bit his hand and started to run when Snape flicked his wand and suddenly a short, stout man stood where Scabbers had been. He was twitching slightly and wrinkling his nose."My friends, my dear friends…" Peter croaked out. His eyes darted around the room and he tried to make a break for it but Sirius grabbed his arm and shoved him back."Don't you dare!" Sirius shouted. "You betrayed James and Lily!"Snape's forehead furrowed in confusion and then understanding came across his face. "You were the secret keeper." He said slowly. His eyes darkened.Peter took a step back, his eyes still flitting back and forth. They landed on Harry. "Harry, dear sweet boy. You look just like your father, he and I were best friends you know…""Don't talk to him!" Snape stood protectively in front of Harry, shielding him from the man who was responsible for Lily's death."Don't even look at him!" Sirius added. A flicker of confusion crossed his eyes as he saw the way Snape was guarding Harry."I had no choice." Peter said pitifully. "The Dark Lord was so strong! What would you have done?" He voice was practically a whine."I would have died trying to protect my friends! I would have never betrayed them, you bloody coward!" Sirius growled."If Voldemort didn't kill you then you had to know we would." Remus said with a shake of his head. He held out his hand to Snape. "My wand please?"Peter's eyes widened with fear. "No, you wouldn't let them kill me would you?" He desperately asked Ron. "I was a good rat, a faithful pet."Ron looked disgusted and Draco and Daphne turned their wands onto Peter as well.Remus took his wand from Snape and they both pointed their wands at Peter."No, please." Peter whimpered."Wait." Harry said suddenly."Harry, this man is responsible for your parents' deaths!" Sirius said incredulously."I know that. Believe me, I know." Harry said quietly. "But we should take him to the castle and let the Dementors have him. He should have to face what he has done."Snape looked torn and then lowered his wand. His expression softened. Harry had the same kind heart Lily had had. "You're right." He turned to Remus and Sirius. "We will take him back to the castle.""We should just kill him. Blast him into pieces like he led people to believe." Sirius muttered."No Sirius, Harry is right. Besides, the ministry needs to see Peter to prove your innocence." Remus pointed out. He waved his wand over Peter. "Incarcerous!" Thin cords shot out of Lupin's wand and bound Pettigrew till he fell to the floor, wriggling around."He should also be chained to two of us." Sirius said, giving in. "No point in taking any chances.""I'll do it." Remus offered."Me too." Draco chimed in.Severus went to Ron and ran a diagnostic. He then tapped the leg gently and muttered a spell. "Ferula." Bandages began circling Ron's injured leg until it was bound in a tight splint. "You need to go to the infirmary. Do not put weight on that leg.""Thank you Sir." Ron said weakly as Snape levitated him so that he didn't have to walk.Remus led the way with Peter tied him and Draco, followed by Daphne who was making sure the levitated Ron didn't bump into anything. Sirius, Harry and Snape walked behind them."Do you know that I am your godfather?" Sirius asked Harry as they walked.Snape remained quiet as he listened."Yes I know." Harry replied. He felt exhausted and overwhelmed with everything that had happened in the last hour."Once I am cleared, you are welcome to come live with me." Sirius offered. "You should have been with me from the start. Unless you are happy with your relatives?"Harry snorted. "No, I was never happy with them." He said honestly.Sirius looked confused for a second but then smiled. "So you will come live with me?" He asked hopefully.Harry hesitated. Sirius might have been a good friend to his parents' but he was a stranger to Harry. Plus, Harry was happy with his living conditions. "I wouldn't mind visiting you and getting to know you but I have a new guardian and I'm really happy with him." He cast a look over his shoulder at Snape. "Unless he is happy to not have to be my guardian anymore?" There was uncertainty in Harry's voice.Snape relaxed. "Of course not little idiot." He had been afraid Harry would agree to live with Black and then Snape would lose him. And Snape knew now that he didn't want to lose the boy who had somehow become a son to him.Sirius gaped at Harry as he watched their exchange. "Are you saying…him? He hated your father Harry! And your father hated him!""I know-" Harry wanted to explain how he came to be the ward of Severus and how good his guardian was to him."Watch it Black!" Snape growled.Sirius opened his mouth to say something but a scream interrupted him. Looking ahead they could see Remus outside, doubling over. His face was twisted with pain."It's a full moon!" Ron cried."He didn't take his potion." Snape said suddenly and quickly he was in front of the teenagers, making sure they were safely behind him.Sirius ran up to Remus. "No Moony! It'll be okay, just remember who you are!"Remus began shaking and soon was transforming, skin becoming covered in fur and growls could be heard. His head grew longer as well as his body. His shoulders hunched over and his hands curled into paws with long sharp claws. He looked up and his eyes turned a feral gold. He moved forward to attack.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Hope you enjoy! I did change some of the wording in the prophecy and added a bit to it to fit my story. Although, it's not much of a prophecy anymore as it already happened lolRemus growled again. He took several steps towards Snape and the teenagers before he was stopped by a large black dog. They began fighting, loud snarls and growls coming from both dog and wolf when Sirius began running towards the forest, Remus chasing him."Merlin, that was…no!" Ron cried and pointed. During the scuffle they had forgotten about Peter who had managed to get free. Peter smirked at them as he began to change into a rat.Harry didn't even think he just began to run. He heard Severus calling him but he didn't stop. He wouldn't stop until he caught that murdering traitor. Out of the corner of his eye he thought he saw a flash of orange pass him. He didn't have time to see what it was as he was brought up short by the sight of Sirius, back in his human form, surrounded by Dementors. "Sirius!" He started to cast his Patronus but there were too many of them. He fell to his knees as his mother's screams echoed in his mind. "No, no, no…." Harry moaned, agony ripping through him at her desperate pleas."Expecto Patronum!"Before he blacked out, Harry saw a bright silvery deer gallop around him.HPHPHPHPHarry woke up to the sound of arguing and the familiar sight of the infirmary. As everything came back to him he shot up in bed and started to stand up."I don't think so young man." Poppy scolded as she immediately handed him a chocolate bar. "Stay in bed until I say otherwise.""But-"Snape stalked over and glared at Harry. "You almost had your soul sucked out of you. Do as Madame Pomfrey says or I will stick you to that bed." He crossed his arms over his chest. All he could see in his mind was the Dementors surrounding Harry and how he almost hadn't gotten to the child in time. If he had even been a few seconds later…Harry sighed and started to lie back down against the pillows before he shot back up. "Wait, is everyone else okay? Ron? Sirius? What about Pettigrew?""Mr. Potter, please eat your chocolate and let me perform a diagnostic." Poppy said firmly.Harry fiddled with the chocolate bar and gave a yelp when it suddenly changed into a mug full of hot chocolate. He looked up and saw Snape putting his wand away. "Thanks." He said softly. For some reason hot chocolate made him feel better faster than the chocolate bar did.Snape nodded as Harry began to drink. He finally felt like his heart was beating normally again since the incident with Lupin and the Dementors. He had lost enough in his life, he couldn't lose Harry too. Not now, when he could finally admit that the boy was like a son to him. "Your friends are fine; Mr. Weasley is in the bed across from you and Black is over there." His tone became distasteful as he spoke the last few words and pointed to the corner of the room where Sirius was still unconscious.Harry looked across the room to see Ron sitting up in bed with his leg heavily bandaged and Daphne and Draco were standing by him, all three were looking at Harry in concern. "Pettigrew?" He asked turning his head to Snape."We have not caught him yet but people are looking and wards have been placed around Hogwarts to stop him from leaving the grounds." Snape said quietly."What if he got off the grounds before the wards were placed?" Harry demanded, feeling stronger now that he had drunk his hot chocolate. "He can't get away, he-""Harry, everything that can be done is being done. I assure you I want him caught just as badly as you do." Snape interrupted. "But you and friends are not a part of this anymore. You will stay in the castle. Understood?""But-""Sticking charm." Snape threatened. He scowled. "We will discuss about how you ended up in the Shrieking Shack to begin with later as well as discussing you running off headfirst into danger."Harry bit his lip. That didn't sound good. "Um, trouble just finds me?" He offered.Snape frowned. "Indeed it does unless you go chasing after it!" He snapped. He took a deep breath. "I need to go check in with Dumbledore as well as Minister Fudge so that they know exactly what happened.""Will Fudge believe you?" Harry asked worriedly, glancing over to where Sirius was."Oh, he will." Snape said darkly. He detested Fudge after how he had treated Harry and he would make sure the fool would believe him. If Pettigrew had made it off the grounds then the ministry would be needed to help look for him. Snape knew exactly where Pettigrew would head to and that would be wherever the Dark Lord was. Pettigrew would see it as the only way to be protected. "You will stay here and I will be back shortly." He commanded."Okay." Harry said softly. After Snape left and Pomfrey went into her office he jumped up and hurried over to Ron. "Are you okay mate?""Yeah, except for the leg." Ron said glumly. "Pomfrey said it would take longer to heal because it was left untreated too long.""How could you run off like that? Are you insane?" Daphne demanded. "You should have seen Professor Snape when he carried you to the castle.""I've never seen our Head of House look afraid before." Draco added."I wanted to catch Pettigrew. I still want to!" Harry said in frustration. That rat had betrayed his parents and Harry wanted him to pay for it."Too bad we don't have Hermione's time turner." Daphne murmured in thought.Draco's silver eyes widened. "Granger has a time turner?" He asked in disbelief."Oops. No one is supposed to know." Daphne said sheepishly. "It's a necklace she wears and I saw her fiddling with it. I've read about them so I recognized it. She said she received the time turner from Professor McGonagall so that she could attend all the classes she signed up for.""So she can use it to turn back time? We need it; we need to write to her right now!" Harry said excitedly. "We can use it to not only catch Pettigrew but save Buckbeak as well!""No Harry." Daphne said softly. "Even if we wrote to her it would take her awhile to get here. Plus time turners are dangerous. Honestly even her using to go back in time for classes is dangerous.""I'm surprised McGonagall allowed it. There have been instances in the past where a wizard or witch killed their past or future selves by mistake or altered their life path drastically." Draco said with some concern in his voice. "I'm really shocked that the ministry allowed this.""Due to Hermione's academic record they allowed it but you can see how stressed she has been this year." Daphne said. She looked at Harry sympathetically. "We can't use it Harry."The door to the infirmary opened and Professor Trelawney walked in. She blinked when she saw the teenagers. "I am in need of a potion from Poppy." She said in her airy voice. "My inner eye has seen that I will have a headache soon."Harry rolled his eyes. "She's in her office."Trelawney started for the office but then stopped and stared at Harry. Her eyes suddenly glazed over. "He will try and return tonight…Tonight, he who betrayed his friends and whose heart rots with murder…has broken free and run. Innocent blood has been spilt…he twitches as he is chased by a ball of fire…servant and master may be reunited once…more!" Trelawney shook her head and looked around in confusion. "You said Poppy was in her office?"Harry stared at her in shock, along with his friends. "Wait, what about what you just said?"Trelawney frowned. "All I said was that I needed a potion for a headache I see myself getting." She looked at them in confusion and then drifted away to Poppy's office."Did she seriously just have some sort of vision?" Ron asked wide eyed."I think she did." Draco answered. "She had to be talking of Pettigrew." He drew in his breath. "Pettigrew will try to return to You-Know-Who." His voice dropped to almost a whisper."No." Daphne also whispered in fear."Wait, she said innocent blood was spilled." Ron said as he tried to sit up more in bed.Harry stared at Ron's bandaged leg. "It was. Yours. I don't know what the ball of fire is though. The sunrise maybe?" Perhaps they only had until sunrise to catch Pettigrew?"Okay wait." Draco ran a hand through his blonde hair. "She said he may return to his master. The Headmaster put wards up to prevent Pettigrew from leaving the grounds. So there is still a chance he could be caught right?""I hope so." Daphne said. "You-Know-Who could get more powerful if he has someone to help him.""Like he almost did our first year when Quirrell was helping him." Harry said dismally. "We have to help look for him! He can't be allowed to return to Voldemort!""The name mate." Ron winced."No Harry." Daphne said firmly. "Professor Snape said to stay here. If we go out after Pettigrew we may just make things worse.""Plus we are already in trouble for not getting an adult when Ron got taken by Sirius." Draco pointed out.Harry looked at Ron, hoping for at least one person who agreed with him. Ron looked back evenly. "I think," He started slowly. "That for once we need to trust the adults. You heard Snape, he wants Pettigrew caught too."Harry shut his eyes for a moment. He was not used to trusting adults. The stone and the chamber, he and his friends had dealt with it. And now he was just supposed to trust that the adults would take care of this? I can trust Severus, he thought. And what better way to show the man he was thinking of like a father that he trusted him? By letting Severus handle the situation. Harry sighed. "So who wants to play Exploding Snap?"HPHPHPHPInside Dumbledore's office Snape paced back and forth, shooting occasional glowers at Minister Fudge. "I should be out looking for that little rodent." He snarled."Hagrid is leading a group of Professor's to look for him." Dumbledore said calmly. "And you can join them of course but we need to hear the full story first." He had cast wards as soon as the potions' master had told him Pettigrew was alive and trying to escape."Where is Black? Is he on his way back to Azkaban?" Fudge asked in a huff. "He has caused the ministry much embarrassment.""He is recovering in the infirmary." Dumbledore answered casually."What?" Fudge stared in shock at Dumbledore. "He needs to be locked up! He is a murderer!""No he is not." Snape said briskly. Oh, part of him would love to have Black locked back up as he still detested the mutt but…he was innocent. Of murder anyway. "Peter Pettigrew committed the murders and faked his own death. He also betrayed the Potters.""That's not possible." Fudge dismissed him with a wave of his hand.Snape gritted his teeth. Was this how Fudge acted when Harry told him about the abuse? "Just because you do not want to deal with it does not make not true!" He snapped.Dumbledore was frowning in thought. "James and Lily switched secret keepers?" He guessed.Snape nodded. "Yes. Pettigrew then betrayed them to the Dark Lord. He has been hiding in his Animagus form of a rat for the past twelve years. Mr. Weasley's rat, Scabbers.""Oh my." Dumbledore had a surprised look on his face. "I had no idea Pettigrew was an Animagus.""Black is one too. He is a dog." Snape informed his employer. He scowled. "Lupin knew this of course."A hurt expression crossed Dumbledore's features. "He never mentioned it. That would be how Sirius was able to escape Azkaban." He said quietly."I still do not believe this. Black is guilty and Pettigrew is dead!" Fudge protested. His eyes widened and he took a step back as Snape whirled around and stalked towards him, an angry expression on his face."I saw Pettigrew myself and heard him confess to it!" Snape said in a soft, dangerous voice that was scarier than when he yelled. "Pettigrew is out there in his rat form and if we do not catch him he will likely try to find the Dark Lord!""But…but He-Who-Shall-Not-be-Named is dead!" Fudge said nervously. He fidgeted a bit under the dark look the Potions Master was giving him."No Cornelius. I have told you before that a part of Voldemort still is out there. He will try to return to full strength and the last we need is one of his followers helping him." Dumbledore said seriously."You may view my memories if you like." Snape said, still staring at Fudge."Wonderful idea. I would like to view them as well." Dumbledore said as he got his pensive down from the shelf. He put the stone basin that was filled with a silvery substance onto his desk.Snape walked over to it and held the tip of his wand to the side of his head, concentrating on the events that had happened tonight. He then pointed his wand at the pensive and silvery wisps went into it. He stepped back and gestured for Dumbledore and Fudge to enter."I don't think-" Fudge started."That is obvious." Snape muttered."Cornelius." Dumbledore said in a commanding tone and together they viewed the memories in the pensive.Snape huffed as he waited. He wanted to check on Harry and make sure he was staying out of trouble and then he would join the hunt for the rodent. Oh I hope I find him first, Snape thought gleefully. Rat parts could be useful in certain potions.Dumbledore and Fudge remerged from the pensive, both looking upset. "I can't believe it! Pettigrew is alive!" Fudge exclaimed shakily.Snape rolled his eyes. How this imbecile ever got elected was beyond him. "Yes he is, as I have been telling you!""Sirius was innocent this whole time." Dumbledore sighed wearily. "I failed him just as I failed Harry.""Perhaps we don't tell anyone of this?" Fudge suggested after a moment. "After all, it will make the Ministry look very bad if everyone found out we imprisoned an innocent man.""You mean it will make you look bad." Dumbledore stated, giving Fudge a stern look. "The truth will be known and you will simply have to deal with it. You just better hope Pettigrew is located.""I would rather-" Fudge began, looking upset that things were not going his way."No one cares what you would rather!" Snape exploded. "Do you have any idea what you have done? Forget that Black was innocent and the real murderer has been free for twelve years. What about Harry? You ignored his abuse!"Fudge paled. He had already been confronted by Dumbledore on that fact which was why he had approved Snape's guardianship when Dumbledore had asked. "He was supposed to be safe with his relatives and at the time I thought Black was out to kill him." He defended himself. "A black eye didn't seem important in the scheme of things." Oh, that had been the wrong thing to say. The room was shaking with Dumbledore's and Snape's magic."How dare you? You saw he was being hurt and did nothing!" Snape hissed. "You will make up for it now however. You will acknowledge the mistake in imprisoning someone who was innocent and you will do everything you can to find Pettigrew. You will also approve my request for adoption of Harry Potter!""Severus?" Dumbledore asked in surprise, his eyes beginning to twinkle again."Adoption? You already have guardianship so that he doesn't have to go back to his relatives. Why do you want to adopt him?" Fudge asked curiously."Because he is my son!" Snape practically shouted. "Along the way that boy has become my son and I want him to feel secure in knowing he has a permanent family, a permanent home. After all, Minister, it would be a shame if the wizarding world knew how you treated their hero." He glared at Fudge. Of course, no one would know as Harry didn't want the truth getting out but what Fudge didn't know wouldn't hurt him.Fudge's eyes widened. "No, there is no need for that." He said hastily. There would be a riot if everyone knew he had sent the child back to his relatives after seeing the boy's black eye. "I will make sure the adoption goes through smoothly. Right now, I am going to go and make sure the best Aurors are looking for Pettigrew.""And Sirius?" Dumbledore asked calmly."He will be publically pardoned and apologized to." Fudge sighed, wondering if he could spin it so that he still looked good in the eyes of the public. "You may let him know he is now a free man." He walked out of the office, feeling two feet tall after being confronted by two powerful and angry wizards."Adoption Severus?" Dumbledore asked after a moment.Snape nodded. "Only if Harry wants to. I meant what I said, I do think of him as a son. However, before I adopt him I will have to tell him the truth about the prophecy. He may not want anything to do with me after he hears about that." There was pain evident in Snape's voice."You should have learned by now not to underestimate Harry. He has an unbelievable capacity for compassion and forgiveness. I believe he will understand, never mind see how you have tried to make up for that mistake." Dumbledore said gently.Snape snorted. "Mistake. It is because of me-""It is because of Pettigrew and Voldemort. Pettigrew deliberately spoke of their location and Voldemort is the one who killed them. He chose to believe a partial prophecy you accidently overheard." Dumbledore pointed out."I made the mistake of becoming a Death Eater and I told the Dark Lord what I overheard." Snape argued. He looked away. "I do not deserve Harry's forgiveness." He said finally."Yes you do." Dumbledore disagreed. "Severus, you have fought for the light since then and not only protected Harry but you took him in and dare I say, have grown to love the child."Snape looked back at his mentor. "Yes, I love him as a son." He admitted. "He may not care about any of that though and I will not blame him in the least. He still deserves to know the truth."Dumbledore nodded. "He does. Right now though, we best join the hunt for Pettigrew."Snape followed Dumbledore out of the office, feeling almost overwhelmed with the stress of finding Pettigrew and the upcoming conversation with Harry about his part in James and Lily's deaths. He knew it was a very real possibility that not only would Harry refuse the adoption but also not want Snape to have guardianship, especially as Harry now had Sirius Black.TBC: Reviews are very much appreciated! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: Thank you so much for the reviews!Harry and his friends were still playing Exploding Snap when Snape walked back into the infirmary. He visibly relaxed when he saw that Harry was still where he had left him."Did you find him?" Harry asked eagerly, jumping up out of his seat when he saw Snape."No, not yet." Snape said wearily. Noticing the disappointed look on Harry's face he added, "There are still people looking round the clock. The wards around Hogwarts have not been breached.""What if he got away before the wards were set?" Draco asked and his silver eyes were concerned."We are hoping that is not the case but the ministry is now on the hunt for him as well." Snape answered. "Aurors have been called in."Harry brightened a bit. "So Fudge knows the truth about Sirius and Pettigrew?" He asked hopefully."Yes. I showed him my memories of what transpired in the Shrieking Shack." Snape sighed, feeling exhausted. It had been a long night so far and he needed a few hours sleep before he could get back out there and search for that blasted rodent.Harry slapped his forehead as he just thought of something. "We should have shown our memories of Buckbeak! We could have saved him!" He exclaimed, his heart sinking."Saved him? What are you talking about?" Snape asked in confusion."They executed Buckbeak tonight. We saw Fudge and the executioner at Hagrid's hut before Sirius grabbed Ron." Harry said, feeling sad for his friend. Poor Hagrid."Buckbeak was not executed."The four teenagers gaped at Snape in shock. "He wasn't?" Daphne asked.Snape shook his head. "Between the Headmaster and I, we were able to convince Minister Fudge that Buckbeak should not be executed.""How did you do that?" Harry asked curiously."I may have sent a few letters to a few parents informing them that Fudge was implying that their precious children were liars." Snape said somewhat smugly. "Professor Dumbledore re-enforced that when he went down to the Hagrid's hut tonight. Fudge didn't want to deal with angry, powerful and influential parents so he called it off and merely put Buckbeak on probation.""Brilliant!" Ron said wide-eyed."Oh, that's wonderful!" Daphne clapped her hands together."And that is why you are Head of Slytherin." Draco grinned."That was so clever, thank you!" Harry beamed. Despite the fact that Pettigrew was still out there, at least everyone would now know that Sirius was innocent and also Hagrid would not lose Buckbeak. Take that Zabini, Harry thought triumphantly.Snape smiled slightly at the happy look on Harry's face. It didn't last long and soon he was frowning. "You all need sleep. Mr. Weasley will remain here as he is still healing. Mr. Malfoy and Miss. Greengrass, go on to your dorms. Harry, let's head to our quarters. I think you should have a calming draught before bed.""I don't need one." Harry protested though he was still feeling on edge after everything that had happened and even just thinking about the Dementors made him shiver."I disagree." Snape said, crossing his arms. "We will also be having a chat about what occurred tonight. I assure you, you will want to be well rested for that."Harry bit his lip. Yup, he was in trouble. "Um, okay. Goodnight Ron." He said to his friend."Let's go." Snape ordered Harry, Daphne, and Draco. They were almost to the door when they heard a snort."Bossy, aren't we Snivellus?" Sirius sat up in bed and glared at his former school mate. He had woken up to hear most of their conversation."Eavesdropping are we?" Snape countered, returning the glare."You can't tell Harry what to do." Sirius said smugly. "I heard you say that Fudge knows the truth. That means I am Harry's guardian."Harry's eyes widened. Did it?Snape took a few steps towards Sirius. "Listen here mutt. I am Harry's guardian. The legal paperwork has been done. If you want to try and contest that fact, then by all means do try. I will gladly fight you on it. As of now, Harry is in my care."Sirius scowled. "Like you know how to care about anyone but yourself." He mumbled. He looked at Harry. "I'll get custody, don't worry pup." He watched in confusion as Harry shook his head."Sirius, no." Harry started to say and then raised his eyebrow. "Pup?"Sirius grinned. "Yeah, I called you that when you were a baby.""You did?" Harry laughed."Yup. I babysat you and everything. Remus did too." Sirius said and smiled sadly at the memories.Harry stopped laughing. "Wait, do you think Remus is okay?""He'll be fine." Sirius assured him. "He will be sore though. Transforming is painful.""Which is another reason he should have remembered to take his potion." Snape snapped. Seeing that Sirius was going to argue back, Snape turned and walked to the door. Pulling it open, he gestured for Harry, Draco and Daphne to walk through. "Time for bed. Now. We can all talk more tomorrow."Harry looked and saw that Ron had already fallen asleep. He walked over to Snape. "Good night Sirius.""Good night Harry." Sirius said with a sigh. He shot Snape a dirty look before lying back down in his bed.After dropping off Draco and Daphne at the Slytherin common room, Snape and Harry walked to their quarters. Once they got in Snape wordlessly summoned a calming draught and handed it to Harry. "Drink."Harry obeyed and instantly felt more relaxed and began yawning. "Goodnight Severus. Thanks for being there tonight and helping with Buckbeak." He drifted off to his bedroom."Goodnight Harry." Snape said softly. He waited a few minutes before checking that Harry was asleep in his bed. His face softened as he heard a gentle snore and he felt more relaxed himself, knowing Harry was safe and home. Now he could finally go and get some sleep.HPHPHPHPHarry woke up and lazily stretched. He felt well rested and had had no bad dreams. He lingered in bed for a couple of minutes before the events of last night came flooding back. He shot up out of bed and after feeding Nova; he quickly showered and got dressed. Had Pettigrew been found? Was Ron okay? Was Remus okay? And was Sirius really going to try and contest the guardianship?Snape looked up as Harry practically skidded into the kitchen. "Are you hungry?"Harry opened to mouth to ask all his questions but ended up saying, "Famished." His stomach rumbled as if to validate him.Snape smirked and gestured to the table which held plates of eggs, bacon and pumpkin juice. Harry took a seat and eagerly began filling up his plate. "Ish Won kay?" He asked through a mouthful of eggs.Snape rolled his eyes. "Chew, swallow, then speak." Teenagers, honestly.Harry swallowed. "Is Ron okay? Has Pettigrew been found? Is Remus okay? And is Sirius really going to try and get custody of me?"Snape set down the paper he had been reading. "Yes, not yet, yes, and probably."Harry frowned. "I was hoping that that rat would have been caught by now. What if he returns to Voldemo-um, You-Know-Who?"Severus looked at Harry seriously. "Although I have not given up hope that he will be found, there is a possibility that he will indeed return to the Dark Lord. He has nowhere else to go so it would make sense that he would seek out the only person who may have use of him. If that happens, we will just have to wait and see. One thing is for sure, I will protect you."Harry smiled slowly and nodded. "I know you will. I still want him caught though. And I don't want Sirius to try and fight you for custody. I mean, I want to get to know him and hear about my parents but I was hoping you would remain my guardian." He looked at Snape somewhat hopefully."Of course I plan on staying your guardian." Snape huffed. "We will talk about that more at a later time. First, how are you feeling? Do you still feel any affects of the Dementors?"Harry shook his head. "No, I feel fine. Can I go visit Ron and Sirius after breakfast?""I would like to talk first." Snape said and a little firmness came into his voice. "Why were you outside last night?"Harry flushed. He had hoped to put off the lecture he was sure was coming his way a little longer. "Um, we were night flying." He admitted.Snape's eyes darkened. "Were you now? I do not remember you asking me if you could go night flying. In fact, I do not remember you mentioning that you wanted to go outside at all.""It was sort of decided on a whim." Harry said weakly. "And, well, we just wanted to have some fun."Snape leaned across the table. "We know now that Black was not after you but you did not know that then. You could have been hurt and I mean more than falling off your broom. I know you know better."Harry fiddled with his fork. "I'm sorry." A swirl of guilt began to settle in.Snape ignored the apology for the moment. "You then went after Mr. Weasley instead of getting an adult. I will be speaking to Miss. Greengrass and Mr. Malfoy about this as well. At the very least one of you should have gotten an adult. You didn't know the stray dog was Black but you did know Mr. Weasley was injured."Harry felt horrible. He was not used to getting lectured by a parent and he didn't like it. More guilt swarmed inside of him."And then you ran off after Pettigrew, with a werewolf on the loose no less! You almost had your soul sucked out of you Harry! And what if Lupin had gotten to you?" Snape was getting more upset as he remembered how he felt seeing his son unconscious and surrounded by Dementors. "You don't rush off into danger. You have to think before you act, do you hear me?""Yes I hear you." Harry said quietly. He raised his eyes to meet Snape's. "I really am sorry. Everything happened so fast and I just reacted." He sighed. "I shouldn't have been outside to begin with and I knew that.""You need to take your safety seriously Harry. You shouldn't have been outside without an adult being there or at least knowing you were out there. And night flying is dangerous; you could easily fly into a tree or the side of building. I do not want you doing that again." Snape warned. "I will ground you, literally, if you do."Instead of feeling ashamed or even bitter about the threat of punishment, it made Harry feel safe. It was nice to have a parent who cared enough to punish him because he was worried about Harry's safety.Snape continued. "I believe we discussed that if anything threatening happened you were to come and get me. You need to trust me Harry.""I had to make sure Ron was okay." Harry protested. "And I do trust you. I had no idea it could be Sirius or Pettigrew. I just thought a stray dog was acting out and I wanted to get him away from Ron.""I am aware of that but it just proves my point. You didn't think there was any real peril around and yet you ended up surrounded by danger!" Snape drummed his fingers on the table. "Do you truly understand Harry? You need to follow the rules and if you sense danger come find me. Or any adult. You have no idea what it was like to see my son lying there –" He stopped himself.Harry, who had been feeling pretty downcast during the lecture, perked up. "You see me as a son?"Snape sighed. He hadn't meant to bring that up yet. "Yes." He admitted gruffly. "I have for awhile.""Wow." Harry said with a goofy grin on his face. He had been seeing Snape as a Dad but had been afraid to say anything. "Same goes for me. I mean, I've been seeing you as a Dad. I didn't say anything because I didn't know if you would like that or not.""I do like it." Snape said softly. "I have been thinking, if you are amendable to it, about making the guardianship permanent.""Permanent?" Harry repeated in confusion. Wasn't it already?"Adoption." Snape said, eyeing Harry for his reaction.Harry's mouth fell open. Snape wanted to adopt him? Snape truly wanted to make it official?"You can think it over and-""No! I mean, I don't need to think it over. I want to be adopted by you." Harry said promptly.Snape gave him a small smile. "I'm pleased that you do. However, there is something you need to know that may change your feelings on being adopted by me. We can discuss that a little later however as I know you want to check on Mr. Weasley and I need to check in with the Headmaster." He stood up. "As for what we have been discussing, I hope to see you thinking things through first before reacting.""I'll try. I mean, I will." Harry corrected himself when Snape started to scowl.After Snape left the kitchen Harry stayed seated for a moment. He was curious about what Snape could think would change his mind. He doubted it mattered though. Harry was thrilled with the idea of being adopted. Of being someone's son. He loved his parents and wished they were here but the sad truth was they weren't. But Snape was here and wanted to raise him, take care of him. And the truth was Snape was good at it. He seemed to understand Harry and though he wasn't at all shy at scolding him if Harry did something wrong he also knew how to be understanding and listen when Harry wanted to talk. He was sure whatever Snape had to tell him would not be bad enough to change all the good Snape had done for him.HPHPHPHPHarry walked into the infirmary to see Ron standing by his bed as he listened to Madame Pomfrey's instructions. He stifled a laugh at the bored expression on Ron's face."You need to get plenty of rest and stay off that leg as much as possible. No running around and no flying either, you falling would not help your leg heal." Poppy lectured. "If your leg starts to bother you please come to me immediately.""I will Ma'am." Ron promised solemnly. He brightened when he saw Harry. "Hey mate!""Mr. Potter, how are you feeling?" Poppy asked as she immediately began running a diagnostic on him.Harry grinned at Ron. "I'm fine Madame Pomfrey." He walked over to Ron. "Good to see you up and about!"Poppy looked in satisfaction at the list her diagnostic had given her. "Very good, Professor Snape did well taking care of you. You ate fine and slept very well.""Yes Ma'am." Harry looked around. "Where is Sirius?""Here."Harry turned and saw that Sirius was now clean and shaven. He looked much better than last night as he apparently had slept well and had obviously borrowed some new clothes. He was still very thin and his eyes looked a bit haunted. "How are you?" He asked awkwardly. It was weird, he had wanted to kill Sirius for months and now he was just curious about the man his parents had named godfather."I feel better than I have felt in a very long time." Sirius grinned. He walked up to Harry and pulled him into a hug. "It's been a long time pup."Harry stepped back and smiled when Sirius released him. "I'm happy that the truth is out. I feel horrible that you sat innocent in Azkaban for twelve years." He shook his head at the thought. "How did you survive it?""I knew I was innocent and had to hold onto that thought." Sirius sighed. "Also becoming Padfoot helped keep me sane as well.""Padfoot?" Harry thought that sounded familiar. Where had he heard it before?"My name for when I am in my Animagus form." Sirius explained. "We called Remus Moony. And we called-""The Marauders map!" Harry exclaimed as he suddenly remembered. "Those are the names on the map!"Sirius looked surprised. "You have the map? We made that, you know." He smiled in memory."George and Fred will want to meet you. They're my brothers." Ron chimed in. "The Marauders are their heroes.""You guys made it?" Harry asked eagerly. "It's brilliant!" He paused. "There were two other names on it too.""Prongs was your Dad Harry. His Animagus form was a stag." Sirius informed him."My Patronus is a stag! Professor Lupin said my Dad's was as well." Harry said, feeling happy. Wow, so his Dad had been an Animagus too?"It was. Your Mum's Patronus was a doe." Sirius said before his mouth fell open. "Wait, you can cast a Patronus already?"Harry nodded, remembering last night he had seen a silvery deer before he had passed out. He had forgotten to ask Snape about it. Had that been Snape's Patronus?"That's my pup!" Sirius said proudly. "You must be very powerful to be able to cast that at the age of thirteen."Harry shrugged. "Professor Lupin taught me so that I could handle it if the Dementors came around me."Sirius nodded in approval. "I'm glad that you have had some good influence then." He said pointedly."I've had a lot of good influence." Harry said quietly, knowing that was a slight against Snape."I've heard things since I've been living on the grounds as Padfoot." Sirius continued. "You were put in Slytherin?" There was disgust in his voice."He's in there for the term." Ron volunteered as he slowly walked around, testing out his leg."You're lucky you are still in one piece after being thrown into the snake den." Sirius commented. "I don't know what Albus could have been thinking.""Don't say that." Harry frowned. "I like being in Slytherin, I've made some good friends there."Sirius's look was disbelieving but he refrained from saying that that couldn't be possible. "We need to talk about Snape being your guardian. You have me now Harry and it's what your parents wanted." He said urgently.Harry looked at him evenly. "Things changed though. They wanted you to raise me and that didn't happen.""No." Sirius said sadly. "But Snivellus? He will not be a good guardian for you, he hated your father!" And vice versa, he thought."Severus has proven to be a great guardian." Harry disagreed. "He's been there for me, taken care of me, listened to me…""He probably has an agenda." Sirius muttered. "He's into the Dark Arts. He's a death eater! I can't believe the Headmaster has him working here.""He was a Death Eater yes." Harry agreed. "He then became a spy for Dumbledore. He's saved my life more than once."Sirius shrugged. "Okay fine. He's saved your life and I'm grateful. But why would you still want him as a guardian? You'll have more fun with me. You can stay up as late as you want, no major rules and I won't bug you about homework as long as you don't fail. It'll be good.""It's just, there's more to it than you know." Harry said lamely. It was hard to explain but he liked that Snape made sure he got enough rest and did his best in homework. He liked that Snape got upset if he broke a rule or put his safety at risk."I'll stay with you." Ron offered. "It sounds good to me!"Sirius chuckled and patted Ron on the shoulder. "See what I mean? Even your friend Ron here knows I'll be a fun guardian!" He turned back to his godson. "Think about it Harry." He said enthusiastically. "We can go flying, go to Quidditch games…""That sounds fun. I don't have to be your ward for us to do that." Harry said gently.Ron cleared his throat. "I'm going to go find Draco and Daphne." He said, feeling uncomfortable at the tense feeling that was growing in the room. He made a quick getaway.Sirius gave a frustrated sigh. "Harry, Snape is not a good guardian for you. I knew him!""You knew him as a teenager." Harry pointed out. "People change. I'm happy, doesn't that matter?""You'll be happy growing up with a guardian who isn't a Death Eater!" Sirius said in frustration. Why was Harry being so difficult about this? "This is a poor way to honor your parents Harry." He immediately regretted his harsh words when he saw the hurt expression on Harry's face. He hadn't meant to say them."You don't get to say that to me!" Harry said angrily. "If you had kept your cool instead of rushing off after Pettigrew twelve years ago then things would be different wouldn't they? You would have raised me the way my parents wanted which would have been honoring them right? So who are you to talk about honor?"The door had been open and Remus, looking tired and worn, walked through to hear what Harry had said. "Harry Potter!" He exclaimed in shock. A stern look came over his features.Harry couldn't look at the upset look on Remus's face and he couldn't look at the hurt look on Sirius's face so he stared at the ground. An uncomfortable silence fell over the room and Harry began to wish he had stayed in bed.TBC:

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling."You should not talk to your godfather like that." Remus scolded as he walked further into the room.Harry looked up; his temper was fully engaged now and he turned to his Professor. "I don't think you are in the position to tell me what I should or shouldn't do." He snapped.Remus looked surprised. "Excuse me?""You got so mad at me because I hadn't turned in the Marauders map. You told me I wasn't honoring my parents sacrifice! Well, what about you? When we all thought Sirius was after me you knew about his ability as an Animagus and yet you said nothing! And when Gryffindor was broken into you still said nothing!" Harry eyes blazed with anger and hurt.Remus paled. "I-I know I should have told the Headmaster. And Harry, I never meant to make you feel bad. I was simply worried for you." He said urgently. He suddenly realized how hypocritical he must seem to Harry."But you did make me feel bad! And how worried could you have been if you didn't tell all that you knew?" Harry asked. "Why didn't you say anything?" He shook his head in confusion."I would like to know that myself." Dumbledore said calmly as he, Minerva and Snape walked into the infirmary. Snape noticed the distressed look on Harry's face and went to stand beside him."Are you all right?" Snape asked quietly. Harry nodded though it was obvious that he wasn't."Albus, I should have told you." Remus said and he looked ashamed. "Sirius, James and Peter became Animagus our fifth year to keep me company when I transformed. I, uh, helped them train.""Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?" Minerva asked sternly. "Not to mention it is illegal to be an unregistered Animagus!" She couldn't believe this had happened under her nose!Sirius shuddered a bit at the glare she was giving him and Remus. It reminded him of his school days when they would get in trouble for pranks they had done in class. I have a feeling she would give us detention right now if she could, he thought dryly."I know." Remus said quietly. He looked at Dumbledore. "You trusted me when you provided the Shrieking Shack so that I wouldn't hurt anybody and I ended up letting my friends join me. I was ashamed for you to know."Dumbledore sighed. "It is a remarkable feat to learn how to be an Animagus on your own and at a young age, not to mention keeping it from me. I am quite impressed." He admitted. His face settled into a stern look. "However, I am disappointed that you did not tell me especially knowing how concerned we have all been this year." There was a twinge of sadness in his tone as he looked at his former student.Sirius saw the defeated look on his friend's face and quickly jumped to his defense. "Don't blame Remus. We wanted to learn to become Animagi. We wanted him to have company when he turned." He insisted."And I understand that." Dumbledore said kindly. "But what if something had happened to one of you? What if when learning to transform something went wrong? What if Remus, in his werewolf form, had still attacked one of you? Not only would Remus's secret have been out, he could have been executed for it. Never mind that if one of you had been hurt, I would have had to answer for it.""Well, nobody got hurt." Sirius said uncomfortably. He felt like he was a student being scolded, how embarrassing. Merlin's beard, I feel like I'm eleven years old again! Sirius thought with a little amusement.Snape had been trying to keep quiet but couldn't hold in his snort of disbelief. "No one got hurt? I believe I almost got hurt with your prank our sixth year. Pettigrew was able to hide out for twelve years thanks to his Animagus form. If you had been honest with Albus, perhaps you wouldn't have ended up in Azkaban. And what about Mr. Weasley? He got hurt by you. And what about the worry Harry has been through so far this year?""I know it is hard for you to understand friendship and loyalty Snivellus-" Sirius started to say but Remus interrupted him."No Padfoot, Severus is right." Remus said as Snape's face darkened at Sirius's words. "People were hurt and I should have told Professor Dumbledore the truth. I admit I was a coward. I didn't want to disappoint someone whose trust meant everything to me and I suppose a part of me could not believe you were truly guilty. I couldn't believe that I had lost all of my friends in one night." Remus looked at Harry. "I was hoping to discover Sirius myself so that I could find out if he was truly guilty. That is why when you mentioned seeing a stray dog I wanted you to stay away from him. I looked for him near the forest myself but never found him.""I hid." Sirius admitted. "I knew you would recognize me and I didn't know how you would react. I wanted to see Harry which is why I ventured out when I saw him." He smiled at his godson. "I've missed so much of your life I wanted to try and be a part of it, even if only as a dog. You look so much like your Dad except for your eyes of course. And your flying is even more impressive than James! So after seeing your broom get destroyed I had to get you the best broom that was out.""You sent me the Firebolt?" Harry asked in surprise. He glanced at Snape. "Well, all of you were right that he sent it." He said ruefully."What do you mean?" Sirius asked as he looked at everyone."As there was no note as to who the Firebolt was from we worried that it was from you, only hexed to hurt Harry." Snape said, crossing his arms."Ridiculous." Sirius muttered."No it isn't. We agreed that the broom should be thoroughly checked out in case it had been charmed to cause harm to Mr. Potter." Minerva said in her no nonsense tone. "Of course, the broom may now be returned to you." She said to Harry in a gentler voice."Really?" Harry said, perking up. "Thanks for the Firebolt." He said to Sirius."Hey, I had twelve years of birthdays to make up for." Sirius grinned."I have a question." Snape interrupted. "What of that interesting map I saw on your desk?" He turned to Remus."Oh, we created that in school." Remus said uncomfortably. "It was, um, recreational.""It should be Harry's now, that would make James happy. I can't believe you still have it Mooney." Sirius asked brightly."I caught Harry with it. I had forgotten about it actually." Remus admitted. "I kept it as a way to find you if you entered the castle and then I saw Pettigrew's name on it, running out of the castle which is what led me to finding you at the Shrieking Shack last night.""I did not hear of this map." Snape said slowly, giving Harry a hard look.Harry shuffled his feet a bit. "It was when Daphne and I were exploring the castle on Hogsmeade day. When Professor Lupin brought us to you he didn't mention it so I didn't think it mattered. Plus," Harry hesitated and turned to his Defense Professor. "Well, you appeared so angry that I had it and had not turned it in." Harry said to Remus somewhat bitterly. He then glanced at Snape. "I didn't want to risk making you that mad at me too."Snape gave a frustrated sigh. "It would be nice if you would start to fully trust me Harry." Honestly, when would the child learn?"I do!" Harry exclaimed with feeling."All right, so now we know the truth." Dumbledore spoke up. "Sirius, I am sorry you spent twelve years in Azkaban for a crime you did not commit. I should have looked into the situation more but I believed you to be the Secret Keeper. However, what is done cannot be undone but at least you can begin to heal and move on with your life.""I would like to know something." Sirius said, straightening up. "How in Merlin's name did Harry become Sniv-Snape's ward?""Padfoot, perhaps right now is not the time." Remus said softly."I deserve to know! He was supposed to be with me and since that couldn't happen, he should still be with his relative's right? So why is Snape his guardian?" Sirius's tone was bitter and he looked coldly at Snape."Harry needed a better guardian." Minerva said, with a glance to Harry.Sirius barked a laugh. "And Snapey here was chosen? I know Harry's relatives are muggles and Lily never really got along with her sister but I am sure they are better for him than Snape!""Shut your mouth mutt!" Snape hissed his hand twitching to grab his wand."No!" Sirius said as he and Snape exchanged hateful looks. "Until I can file for guardianship, I want Harry back with his relative's. I don't trust you Snivellus!" The contempt was clear in his voice.Snape in a flash had his wand out and was pointing it right between Sirius's eyes. "Keep talking and I'll make sure you become a dog permanently.""Sirius, you do not know all the details." Remus said firmly as he looked at his friend. "Trust me; Severus has been a wonderful guardian to Harry."Sirius looked at them all suspiciously. "Have you all been confounded? It doesn't make sense. Snape hated James and vice versa! There is no way he could care about Harry!"Harry looked away. Okay, those words hurt. It reminded him of his relatives telling him that he wasn't worth caring about. He knew Sirius didn't know the whole story but still…it hurt.Sirius suddenly went flying across the room and slammed into the wall. He slowly got up and started for Snape, fists clenched tightly."How dare you say that!" Snape glowered so fiercely at Sirius that the Marauder actually stopped and took a step back. Snape kept his wand pointed at Sirius. "You know nothing! I care for the child as if he were my own son!"Sirius's mouth dropped open. "You are not his parent!" He spat out."I'm as good as!" Snape responded with a heated glare. Sparks flew out of his wand as he was ready to hex the mutt. Sending him flying had only been a little satisfying. Maybe he should send the mutt through the wall.Sirius threw his hands up and looked at Remus for support. "How can you just accept this? You know how Snivellus was in school!""I know how we were in school too." Remus told him. "We were bullies Sirius. We made mistakes too. But we aren't kids anymore and we need to be adults. The truth is Severus is the kind of parent Harry needs." He offered Harry a smile. "Although I hope we can be a part of his life as well.""Of course we will. Can we please not forget that I am his godfather?" Sirius shook his head. "I can't help thinking James and Lily would be disappointed in this, they wanted him raised by me if something happened to them." Regret showed in his grey eyes.Harry's face fell. Sirius just didn't understand. "I think they would be happy for me." He said quietly."What about your relatives? How bad can they be? I still think you should stay with them until we figure out the guardianship." Sirius decided. He paled at the looks he was getting from the adults. What was the big deal?"I will never return to the Dursley's!" Harry suddenly shouted. "They hated me! They beat me and starved me! They made me feel worthless! He-" Harry pointed to Snape. "saved me from ever having to go back there again. He helped heal me and bought me clothes of my very own. He listens when I need to talk, lectures when I need to hear it and gave me a real home. He's my Dad in every way that matters okay?" Once he stopped shouting, Harry's face turned red from embarrassment and shame for yelling and he ran out of the room.Sirius stared after him in shock. "He was abused?" He whispered in horror. No!"Yes, when he started this school year he was black and blue and bleeding internally." Dumbledore said seriously. "Harry had been wearing glamour so we didn't see it. Severus has all of the students in his House checked out with Madame Pomfrey and the truth came out then.""Poor pup." Sirius murmured and he felt his heart break. He winced as he thought about how he had just been insisting Harry return to the Dursley's. His face hardened. "His relative's are in Azkaban aren't they?" His voice was low."No. Harry didn't want the knowledge of his abuse to come out and we are respecting that." Dumbledore answered. "Only we, Poppy, and some of Harry's friends know.""They can't get away with what they did!" Sirius protested. "I'll take care of them myself!" Oh, he wasn't a prankster for nothing. He could make the Dursley's miserable for the rest of their pathetic lives."I assure you, they have been dealt with." Snape said somewhat smugly.Sirius paused in his plotting. "You killed them?""No." Snape frowned. I was tempted to though, he thought. "I just made sure they would live to regret their actions towards Harry." He smirked slightly."Oh." Sirius frowned. Did Snape really care about his godson? It had to be an act right? "I still want him with me." He said finally."You can try but I will be fighting you every step of the way." Snape warned. "Do you really think after twelve years locked up that you are ready to be a parent to a teenager?"Sirius averted his eyes. "I don't know but I do know I will be better than a Death eater!" He spat out."I am not a Death Eater anymore." Snape snapped back. "I will protect Harry with my life. I've been protecting him to the best of my ability since he stepped foot in Hogwarts!"Sirius suddenly smirked. "Oh really? I heard things while hiding out as Padfoot. I heard students talking about how they couldn't believe Harry was put in Slytherin, where the Head of House hated him. Care to explain that Snivellus?""Enough with the name calling." Dumbledore said in an authoritative voice."I did not treat Harry kindly when he started at Hogwarts." Snape agreed stiffly. "I protected him in secret but I convinced myself that he was a spoiled, arrogant child. I was wrong and I will always regret how I treated him. I see the boy for who he is now, a bright, brave, compassionate child who has had to grow up too fast in many ways.""I will say for the record that I will be giving my support to Severus when he applies to adopt Harry." Dumbledore said. He merely smiled innocently when Snape glared at him."Adopt? You are going to adopt Harry?" Remus asked, a smile spreading across his face."Oh no you're not!" Sirius protested. "How can you approve this Albus? Think about James and Lily!" Sirius could feel a headache coming on. Honestly, this was too much."Believe me, I am." Dumbledore said. "I have failed Harry by not making sure he was being treated well at the Dursley's. While I suspected that they would not care for him as if he were their own son, I never dreamed they would hurt him the way they did. He deserves to have a stable home life where he is well cared for, loved and protected. Severus has already supplied all of that and more.""I've been observing Harry while I have been here and he is obviously happy with Severus. I believe he also feels safe, which is not something he would have had in the past." Remus told Sirius gently. "You're still his godfather Padfoot. You can still be a part of his life. Harry deserves to have as many people possible that he considers family and hopefully if he forgives me, he will think that way of me as well.""Like uncles." Dumbledore suggested merrily which caused Minerva to laugh.Snape rolled his eyes. That was all he needed, Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus always wanting to visit. He would have put up with them though, if it made Harry happy. "I don't see the point in discussing this further. If you still decide to contest the adoption, you will lose." Snape said in a low voice. "I don't like you and I doubt that that will ever change but I will put up with you for the boy if you accept the situation and not try to make Harry feel bad about it or guilty. I didn't like James, we all know that. But I do believe he would want someone to take Harry in and care for him the way I have. I believe Lily would have wanted that too." Snape took a deep breath. "Harry has not had the life they would have wanted for him and I am trying to make up for that." With that, he stalked out of the room so that he could check up on Harry as well as he knew if stayed in the same room with the mutt any longer he would punch his lights out.Sirius stared after him with a bewildered look on his face. "When did Snape change?""He grew up Padfoot. We are not fifteen anymore." Remus said with a sympathetic smile."I still don't trust him." Sirius muttered. He caught Remus's knowing look and scowled. "I know, I know. I'm not fifteen anymore and I need to grow up. But Mooney, Harry should be having fun and what kind of fun can he have with Snape?""That will be the fun of being uncles." Remus said somewhat mischievously. "We get to spoil him while Severus has to enforce rules and curfews."Sirius brightened. He had to admit, he probably wouldn't be good at setting rules and groundings and the like. He had grown up with exceedingly strict parents and knew he would be the opposite of them. "We can teach him things too. Like pranks and jokes and how to how to talk with your friends during detention." He saw his former Head of House look at him suspiciously and he merely gave her a sweet smile.Remus chuckled. "Exactly."Sirius sobered up. "I need to talk with Harry.""Probably best to let him cool down a bit. A lot has changed for him within the last couple of days." Dumbledore suggested.Sirius nodded, feeling ashamed for acting like he had. Would Harry even want him to be part of his life?HPHPHPHPHarry was in the owlery when Snape found him. He was standing at the balcony looking out at the grounds as he pet Hedwig. She hooted when she saw Snape. Harry turned and had a guilty look on his face. "Sorry I shouted and ran out like that. Not very mature of me, I guess.""There was not much maturity in that room unfortunately." Snape admitted ruefully. He shook his head as Harry continued to look guilty. "You did nothing wrong. No one is mad at you.""Sirius and Remus might be. I sort of said some things to them before you came in." Harry admitted. At Snape's questioning look he explained what had occurred with Sirius and Remus right before he had come into the infirmary.Snape tried to quell down his anger at those two idiots. "It's okay, you did nothing wrong." He repeated. "You have a right to let them know how you feel. Lupin should have told the Headmaster everything he knew and neither of them have the right to make you feel like you have not honored your parents sacrifice." He hesitated. "Your parents would be proud of you."Harry relaxed. "I shouldn't have blurted out my abuse like that. I just really want Sirius to understand.""He will." Snape said, looking out at the grounds. He was sure the werewolf, Minerva and Albus would make sure the mutt understood. "Just give him time. If he does still want to fight me adopting you I will fight him every step of the way.""Thanks." Harry whispered. He really did hope Sirius would accept Snape adopting him. He wanted to get to know his godfather but he didn't want to live with him. He didn't know him and frankly, he wasn't sure how stable Sirius was due to the things he had done, like hurting Ron or slashing The Fat Lady's portrait. It wasn't Sirius's fault though, Harry couldn't imagine being exposed to Dementors for twelve years. Suddenly Harry remembered something. "Um, there is something I forgot to tell you."Snape looked at him questionally. "Yes?""Last night Trelawney came into the infirmary for a headache potion. She, um, went into a trance and had a sort of vision, I think."Snape's eyes went wide. "And what did she say?" He kept his voice calm."Something about, he will try and return, has broken free and run, chased by a ball of fire, that servant and master may be reunited once more." Harry shrugged. "I don't remember it word for word. Ron, Daphne and Draco heard it too. Trelawney didn't even know she had said anything. It had to mean Pettigrew. He may return to Voldemort if he hasn't already, and I know he will and try to help him return to full strength."Snape said nothing of Harry saying the name. He would have to get over that as it was. "He may try to find the Dark Lord, yes." He agreed. "However, may is the key word. She did not predict he would for sure. But I believe you are right; if Pettigrew is able to find the Dark Lord then he will try and help him become whole once again.""I wish I had Hermione's time turner." Harry muttered. He stilled when he realized what he had said and looked at Snape sheepishly."I thought Miss. Granger understood that that was a secret." Snape said stiffly. He had not approved the use of a time turner though it had not been up to him. Never mind that it was dangerous even if the person using it was responsible but it was obvious that Miss. Granger had been running herself ragged all term. He had planned on talking to Minerva about it."She didn't tell me. I only recently found out about it." Harry hurried to say. "Someone saw her with it. They won't tell anyone else though."It must be Weasley, Malfoy or Greengrass, Snape mused to himself. He turned a stern look to Harry. "You will never use a time tuner, do you understand me? They can be extremely dangerous and in my opinion your friend should never have been given one to use." He sighed. "Believe me, I understand the appeal. But while you think you are fixing one thing, several other things could end up wrong. You would become obsessed with continuing to go back in time and risk injuring or killing yourself in the process. Thankfully, time turners are very hard to get a hold of." He glanced at Harry. "If one could have been used to save your parents, I would have done it myself."Harry nodded slowly."Although, this gives me an idea. I didn't want to be too hard on you despite the fact that you rushed into danger and also went outside the castle without permission. But perhaps writing an essay would suffice. It would also be educational for you as the topic will be on the dangers and uses of time turners." Snape nodded in satisfaction.Harry sighed. He had hoped the lecture he had gotten had been all that would happen to him. Writing an essay was a pretty tame punishment though, especially for Snape. "So I'm not grounded?" He asked hopefully, wanting to be sure."No.""I don't have to clean cauldrons?""No.""I don't have to clean your classroom with a toothbrush?""No.""I don't have to cut up disgusting ingredients?""Only during class.""I don't have to –""Harry." Snape interrupted with some amusement. "The essay is all. The length depends on you and what you discover during your research. It's due in two weeks or sooner if you finish early.""Wow, thanks." Harry said, brightening. That wasn't bad at all. And as he didn't know much about time turners, it might even be interesting!"I assure you, if you put your safety in jeopardy again I will not be so lenient." Snape warned, trying to sound stern. He did have a reputation to uphold after all."Yes sir." Harry grinned. He burst into laughter when Hedwig flew to Snape's shoulder and began trying to eat his hair.Snape scowled as he tried to shoo the annoying bird away. He couldn't get too mad though. Not when it made him feel good to hear Harry laugh."I can't believe you sent Sirius flying into a wall." Harry commented as they left the owlery."Ah, well as a responsible adult I should say that I regret doing that but…I don't." Snape shrugged."So can I do that to people who annoy me?" Harry asked hopefully."No. Unless it is Black, of course and then I will turn a blind eye." Snape said, only half joking. He noted that Harry's mood was considerably lighter and felt relieved. He worried deep down that he would fail as a father but he knew he would never give up trying to be a good one.TBC: Please review if you get a chance! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: I really appreciate all the reviews and adds! They make me so happy!Harry went back to his quarters while Snape went out to look for Pettigrew. Harry hated to think it but he doubted that Pettigrew was still around. He's probably on his way to Voldemort right now, Harry though miserably as he entered his room. He picked Nova up from the glass home and settled onto the bed. Nova slithered up Harry's arm, coiling itself around like a bracelet. Harry glanced around. "Have you ssseen Crookshanksss?""No, not sssince lassst night." Nova answered. "What hasss been going on?"Harry quickly explained the events of last night and suddenly he remembered that Crookshanks had been there at the Whomping Willow. What if he had gotten hurt? Harry worried. After all, Crookshanks usually always came back. With everything going on Harry had completely forgotten about him. The last thing he wanted was to have to tell Hermione that something bad had happened to her familiar. Plus Harry had grown fond of the orange, flat faced cat. "I need to go look for him." He told Nova.Harry went to leave but stopped right before he got to the door. He could search the castle for Crookshanks but he couldn't go outside and look. He sighed. He wanted to check outside in case Crookshanks did in fact get hurt but he wasn't about to break a rule again. He'd have to ask Snape to look for him or maybe he would go with him. No, I doubt I'll be allowed out of the castle until Pettigrew is caught or at least believed not to be on the grounds, Harry thought dejectedly. Well, he could at least search the castle. Glancing at Nova still on his arm he decided to leave his snake here. He didn't want to risk losing one of his familiars as well. He turned to leave a note for Snape as well as put Nova back in his room but a knock on the door interrupted him.Harry opened it. "Sirius?""Hey pup. I hoped you would be here." Sirius said with an apprehensive smile. "Is Sniv, um, is Snape around?""No he is out looking for Pettigrew." Harry answered. "Did you want to come in?""Yeah thanks." Sirius looked around as he entered. Hmm, it appeared like normal quarters. "So did Snape clear the cobwebs and bats before you moved in?" He joked.Harry rolled his eyes and grinned. "Nope. This is how it has always been.""Huh." Sirius looked around again and then his gray eyes settled on the snake on Harry's arm. "Did you know that you are wearing a live snake?"Harry laughed. "This is one of my familiars, Nova. I also have an owl named Hedwig.""A snake huh?" Sirius gazed curiously at Nova. "Hello Nova, I'm Sirius, Harry's godfather."Nova made a hissing sound and Sirius's eyebrows raised in slight alarm."Nova says it is nice to meet you." Harry grinned.Sirius's gray eyes snapped to Harry's. "You understand snakes?" He asked in shock.Harry nodded. "Yeah, I'm a Parselmouth." He confirmed. He eyed his godfather. "You aren't scared of me now or anything are you?" Thoughts of last year and how his fellow peers had treated him flowed through his mind.Sirius laughed. "No, I'm not scared of you. I'm surprised though." He looked thoughtful. "That specific ability is, um, rare." He said carefully."Dumbledore thinks when the killing curse backfired that I got some of Voldemort's abilities." Harry shrugged.Sirius looked concerned for a moment and then smiled. "Having a pet snake you can talk to is pretty brilliant I bet.""Yeah, Nova is great." Harry gently patted Nova's head. He looked at Sirius curiously. "So um, did you want something?"Sirius cleared his throat nervously. "I wanted to talk to you. I'm sorry for our disagreement earlier. I didn't mean to say anything that would hurt you. And I just, I can't stand what happened to you. With your relative's I mean. It's my fault."Harry looked surprised. "No it isn't.""It is." Sirius insisted. "I was supposed to take care of you. I should have stayed with you that night but instead I let Hagrid take you and I went after Pettigrew. You were right, I didn't honor James and Lily by letting my anger take over. I acted impulsively."Like I did last night, Harry thought ruefully. It must be the Gryffindor in them. "I don't blame you for wanting to confront Pettigrew." He said softly."Still, I shouldn't have." Sirius said unhappily. "I would have raised you and your blasted relatives would never have hurt you."Harry couldn't say anything to that. After all, it would have been nice to be raised by someone who cared about him but at least he had that now. "It's okay Sirius. I never have to return to them again and now you are free."Sirius nodded. "Yeah I'm free." He brightened."So what are you going to do now?" Harry asked curiously.Sirius laughed. "I have no idea! Before everything happened I had been looking into being an Auror but then I joined the fight against Voldemort with your Dad and Remus. I have the house I grew up in, not that there are any happy memories there and I still have my vault so I'm pretty much set money wise." He shrugged. "James and I had talked about maybe becoming Aurors one day. It will be weird to do without him."Harry smiled sadly at the dejected look on Sirius's face. "You must really miss him.""He was like a brother to me, Mooney too. I miss James every day." Sirius admitted. "You remind me of him. I mean, you look so much like him and I hear you get into mischief like he did too!""Trouble just finds me." Harry protested with a laugh.Sirius snickered. "Yeah, it found us too." He paused. "Okay, we might have helped it find us." He grinned.Harry grinned back. "Yeah, I know how that goes.""So I know you are quite the flyer, like your Dad." Sirius said proudly. "I saw you during that game. You were great! Well, until the Dementors showed up."Harry winced. "That game did not end well for me. Or my broom.""I know." Sirius frowned. His godson had been through too much. "I'm sorry the Firebolt got taken away from you. I didn't even think that anyone would be suspicious of it.""How did you obtain it?" Harry asked curiously."Oh, Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but wrote down to take the money from my own vault." Sirius answered."He did?" Harry gave a start. "Oh, I need to go! Crookshanks is missing. He was out there last night and helped up get past the Whomping Willow and I haven't seen him since."Sirius looked concerned. "I hope he is okay. He is quite a smart cat. He understood right away that something was off about that rat.""I'm going to go look for him." Harry said. "Do you want to search with me? I can't go outside but-""Of course you can go outside." Sirius scoffed. "We'll check the Whomping Willow first since that is where you last saw him."Harry bit his lip. "Okay, let's go." After all, it wasn't like he was going outside alone or anything. And it wasn't to look for Pettigrew, though Harry would be keeping an eye out for him. Plus, he had a duty to look for Crookshanks as he was Harry's responsibility. Harry put Nova back into his room and then left with his godfather.HPHPHPHP"Where do you think you are going?" Snape asked in a dangerous voice as he stopped Harry and Sirius just as they were about to walk out of the castle. He looked sternly at Harry. "You are to stay inside.""I know, but Crookshanks is missing! He was out there last night and he could be hurt." Harry explained in a worried tone."I'm with him." Sirius said with a roll of his eyes. "I'll protect Harry."Snape glared. "Forgive me if that does not make me feel better. Do you have a wand Black?"Sirius frowned. "Not yet. Harry has his though." Dumbledore had promised to look into obtaining his wand, which has been held at the ministry since he had been arrested.Snape closed his eyes for a moment. "I will go back out and look for the cat.""No Pettigrew yet?" Harry asked dejectedly."No.""He got away didn't he?" Harry sighed."We don't know that for certain." Snape tried to sound reassuring. "As a rat, he could hide anywhere on the grounds. You will stay inside until we know for sure.""What about me?" Sirius asked indignantly."What about you?" Snape asked impatiently."Harry would be safe with me!" Sirius pointed out again. "We can go look for Crookshanks together."Snape just stared at him."What?" Sirius asked, crossing his arms. "I can handle whatever comes our way. If Pettigrew comes at us and tries anything I'll-"Suddenly Sirius flew back inside the castle and crumpled into a heap on the floor. He got up and glared at Snape. "Stop doing that!""I thought you said you could handle anything." Snape said innocently.Harry looked warily between them, not wanting a fight to break out. "I'll stay inside." He promised. "Maybe Crookshanks is somewhere in the castle.""You may search the castle as long as someone capable is with you, an adult or your friends. I don't want you alone." Snape instructed."I'll search with you Harry." Sirius offered as he brushed off some dirt from his sleeve."I said someone capable." Snape muttered.Sirius rolled his eyes. "Go make yourself useful and turn into a bat or whatever you do and find Pettigrew.""Okay, let's start looking." Harry said quickly when he saw the murderous look on Snape's face."You better not teach him any bad habits." Snape warned Sirius. "No slobbering, drooling, chasing sticks, digging through the trash…""Let's go!" Harry pulled on Sirius's arm before things could escalate."How do you put up with that bat?" Sirius grumbled as they began walking. "He's evil!""I used to think so. My first year I was sure of it." Harry admitted as they walked. He told Sirius about the Sorcerer's Stone and how he and his friends had been sure Snape had been trying to steal it. He told of how instead, Snape had been keeping an eye on Quirrell and had also saved him from falling off his broom during his first match."Hmm." Sirius mused. "It was probably because James saved his life sixth year." He said thoughtfully."Yeah, Dumbledore mentioned something about that." Harry perked up. "What did my Dad save him from?"They turned a corner and headed to the stairs that led to the Gryffindor common room. Harry wanted to check if Crookshanks had gone into there as that is where he usually lived.The Fat Lady glared at Sirius as Harry said the password. "You dare come back here after what you did?" She demanded.Sirius bowed. "My humble apologies my Lady. I never meant to cause you harm. I simply was trying to catch a dangerous murderer who resided in here." He stood straight and gave her a charming grin.The Fat Lady smiled a little. "Oh yes, I heard about that. Frightening that he was here the whole time.""I do hope you can forgive me?" Sirius asked with a flirtatious smile.The Fat Lady giggled a little. "Yes, I suppose I can.""Thank you my beauty." Sirius said grandly, giving her a wink. After the portrait had closed behind them Harry eyed Sirius."You're obviously used to getting out of trouble." He grinned.Sirius laughed. "Yeah a bit."Walking further in, Harry called out for Ron and when there was no answer he figured Ron was with Draco and Daphne. "So? How did my Dad save Severus?""Well," Sirius hesitated. He didn't want to tell the whole story as he and Harry had already been at odds. "Sniv-er Snape had been following us, wanting to get us into trouble. He ended up at the Shrieking Shack when Remus was a werewolf and James got him out of the way before he could be hurt."Harry's mouth dropped open. "He was almost attacked by Professor Lupin?""Yeah." Sirius sighed. "It was a stupid idea but he shouldn't have been trying to find out where Remus went every full moon. It was only supposed to be a joke but James and Remus were so mad at me."Harry paused. "Wait, why would they be mad at you?" He asked suspiciously.Sirius sighed. "I told Snape how to get past the Whomping Willow and that he could find out what Remus had been up to. James found out and grabbed him before he had made it down the tunnel but Snape saw Remus in his werewolf form. He was instructed by Dumbledore not to tell anyone."Harry gaped at him. "That's, how could, I mean…that's mental! Why would you do that?""It was a joke. And Snape should have kept big his nose out of our business. He was too curious for his own good; I didn't force him to the shack." Sirius defended himself, realizing it sounded lame. "I didn't think about anyone actually getting hurt, I just thought Snape would get a scare. Which he did." Sirius smirked a little at the memory of Snape's paler than usual face. He saw the disapproving look on Harry's face and his smirk faded. "Pup, I was young and foolish. I could have gotten Remus into major trouble if he had ended up hurting Snape. Both he and James were furious with me over it."Harry had turned away, a sick feeling in his stomach. He continued calling for Crookshanks hoping the orange cat would come trotting down the stairs. He didn't want to think about what he had just learned from Sirius. Geez, no wonder Snape had hated him so much! He had been bullied by Harry's father and almost killed by Harry's godfather! "Did you ever apologize?" He asked, turning back to his godfather."Of course I did!" Sirius nodded. "I begged James and Remus to forgive me. And I apologized to Professor Dumbledore as well."Harry stared at him. "No, I mean did you apologize to Severus? After it happened?"Sirius looked surprised. "Well, no." He said slowly. "But he never apologized for following us and trying to get us into trouble." He closed his eyes at the weak statement."Whatever he did, he didn't deserve to almost die or be bitten for it." Harry said softly."I know pup." Sirius ran a hand through his long shaggy hair. "I do know it was wrong okay?"Harry cleared his throat, wanting to change the conversation for now. "Um, Crookshanks isn't here. I say we walk the hallways and call for him."Sirius regarded Harry for a moment, feeling guilty for disappointing his godson. I'll make it up to him, Sirius told himself as they left the Gryffindor Tower. I'll…try to be nicer to Snape. He grimaced at the thought but was willing to try for Harry. All he had now was Remus and Harry. He didn't want to lose his godson just because he couldn't act mature around someone he detested.HPHPHPHPAfter almost an hour of searching the castle Harry was beginning to get very worried. There was no sign of Crookshanks."Maybe he is back in Snape's quarters?" Sirius suggested."I hope so." Harry said as they began to walk to the dungeons. He wondered if Snape had found any sign of the cat outside. He wished he could go out there and look himself.While they walked, Sirius and Harry ran into Draco, Daphne and Ron. They looked happy to see Harry but a little nervous to see Sirius."Hello Mr. Black." Daphne said cautiously.Sirius laughed. "Please don't call me that. Sirius is fine." He looked at Ron. "How is your leg?""Oh, it feels fine now." Ron answered with a shrug."I'm really sorry you got hurt." Sirius said sincerely. "My focus was on getting Pettigrew.""Don't blame you for that." Ron made a face. He couldn't believe that a murderer had been Scabbers all along. His mother was going to go metal."Sirius, this is Daphne Greengrass and Draco Malfoy." Harry said, realizing he hadn't really met them yet."Malfoy and Greengrass?" Sirius looked at them spectively. He remembered how protective they had been of Harry in the Shrieking Shack and wondered how many of his preconceptions were going to be ruined. "It's nice to officially meet all of you." He said with a smile. "Sorry if last night I seemed…""Bonkers?" Draco asked. He glared when Harry pushed him and Daphne scowled at him. Ron just snickered."Yeah, bonkers." Sirius grinned ruefully. A silvery Phoenix flew by him suddenly and he gave a start and then his eyes brightened. "Professor Dumbledore has my wand." He said giddily. "I'm going to go get it and then I will search outside for Pettigrew and Crookshanks.""What happened to Crookshanks?" Daphne asked after Sirius had left them."He's missing. He was at the Whomping Willow last night, remember?" Harry said. "I haven't seen him since.""Oh, I hope he is okay." Daphne said with concern."Me too." Harry sighed. They began discussing the chances of Pettigrew being caught when they heard a shout."Harry!"Hermione, Tracey and Theo were hurrying over to them."What are you guys doing here? Breaks not over for a few more days!" Harry exclaimed in surprise."We heard about what happened!" Hermione said tearfully as she first hugged Harry. "I can't believe Sirius Black was innocent all this time! And Ron, you were hurt!" She hugged Ron quickly before pulling back. Both teenagers were blushing."Daphne sent us each a letter early this morning. The three of us quickly got in contact with each other and made plans to return early." Tracey explained. "We're glad each of you are okay.""So Pettigrew was your rat?" Theo shuddered. "Creepy.""Tell me about it." Ron shook his head. "I just hope they catch him.""They still haven't found him?" Hermione asked. She bit her lip. "Well, I suppose he could be hiding anywhere.""Let's face it, he probably got away." Harry said flatly. "Pettigrew will find Voldemort and help him return to full power and then another war will start.""So much for optimism." Daphne said exasperatedly. "We don't know that will happen. Not only are the Aurors looking for him but very powerful wizards like the Headmaster and Professor Snape.""But it will be my fault if it happens!" Harry argued."How do you figure that?" Draco asked with a frown."Professor Lupin and Sirius and even Severus were ready to kill him. I stopped them." Harry said in frustration."You did the right thing. It is better for him to be brought to justice." Hermione nodded."But now he has escaped!" Harry exploded."Harry calm down." Daphne urged. "Hermione's right, you did the right thing."Harry shook his head and looked away. "I wish I could help look for him but we I'm not allowed out of the castle." I could use my cloak, he mused. He saw Hermione glaring at him and realized she knew what he was thinking."Don't even think about it Harry." Hermione warned."Fine." Harry muttered. His eyes widened. "Hermione, Crookshanks." He whispered as he remembered."What about Crookshanks?" Hermione asked. She turned to Ron. "Did you hurt my cat?""No! Besides, your cat was right to be after Scabb-er Pettigrew." Ron sighed."Crookshanks was outside when everything happened. I haven't seen him since." Harry said guiltily. "He had been helping Sirius when he was in his Animagus form. In fact, Sirius said Crookshanks helped him deliver the note to get the Firebolt for me. Sirius and I have been looking for him and Severus said he would look outside.""No wonder he would disappear all the time." Hermione mused. "I hope he is okay." She said worriedly."I'm sorry Hermione." Harry shook his head."Stop being so hard on yourself, you did have a lot going on." Daphne told Harry."Wait, so Black sent you a Firebolt?" Theo suddenly asked with interest."I got it a couple days before Christmas only there was no note with it. So the Professors' said it had to be checked for curses and jinxes before I could use it." Harry explained. "They suspected that Sirius had sent it to harm me in some way. But now that we know the truth, McGonagall said I could have it back.""Brilliant." Theo's eyes gleamed."So I have a question." Tracey cut in. "If Sirius is your godfather, is he going to be your guardian now?"Harry shook his head. "No. He wants to be but I'm happy with how things are you know? I already see Severus as my parent, as my Dad so-"Ron cleared his throat pointedly and Harry followed his gaze to where Sirius was standing behind them. From the look on his face, Sirius had heard what Harry had said and he wasn't happy about it.TBC: This story is almost done but I am starting a draft for a sequel, which will take place in fifth year. Also, is there anything you would like to see for the fifth year? Pairings? Snape dealing with Umbridge? Someone else helping Voldemort return? Sirius teaching a subject (which would totally make Snape happy LOL) Let me know! =)

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: While this story only has one more chapter, I've decided to follow it up with a one-shot showing moments of year four before starting the sequel =)"Honestly Harry, if you tell me you are going to call that overgrown bat Dad, I will be sick all over the floor and Filch will hate me more than he already does." Sirius said flatly.Harry narrowed his eyes and gave his godfather a fierce glare."Why does Filch hate you?" Hermione asked curiously."Filch hates everyone." Ron pointed out."There may have been a prank or two played on him when I was in school. Or three. Maybe Four." Sirius shrugged though his gaze never left Harry. "I lost count.""Sirius, Remus, my Dad and Pettigrew were kind of like Fred and George in school with their pranks. Only cruel." Harry said as he met Sirius's gaze evenly."Pup." Sirius sighed. "I'm going to try and get a handle on this okay? With Snape being your guardian but you can't call him Dad. He's not your Dad.""Except he is. He became so this year." Harry said. He shook his head. "I don't want to argue about this anymore okay? We have enough going on with Pettigrew and Crookshanks missing."Sirius rubbed his hand over his face. He still didn't trust Snape but everyone else seemed to. For right now, he would drop the conversation but one thing was for sure. He was not finished talking to Harry about this. "All right Harry. I'm going to go out and join the hunting party. Do you want to come?""I can't." Harry said regretfully."Why not? Let's go find that coward!" Theo said determinedly.Daphne shook her head. "Professor Snape wants us to stay inside while they search for Pettigrew."Theo looked disappointed but nodded. Harry was tempted to go with Sirius but he couldn't. He wanted to show Severus that he did trust him and that he was taking his safety seriously. It was hard though. "Be safe Sirius."Sirius nodded though his eyes showed a little disappointment. "I'll catch up with you later Harry. Don't worry. I'll be careful." He promised."Be careful doing what?" Remus asked as he walked up to the group."I'm going to go join the search for Pettigrew." Sirius informed him."Actually, the search has been called off." Remus said with a sigh. "Albus wants everyone in the Great Hall."Harry paled. The search was called off and Remus didn't look like that was a good thing. Pettigrew got away, he thought dejectedly. How soon until Voldemort returned to full power and came after him? Or worse, went after those he cared about?Entering the Great Hall Harry immediately walked over to Snape who stood near the Headmaster with a grave look in his face. "He escaped didn't he?" Harry asked quietly as all the Professors and students who stayed for the holiday break gathered together."It would appear so." Snape said, trying to not to show the worry and fear he was feeling. He had always known the possibility of the Dark Lord returning and had prepared to become a spy once again while doing what he could to protect Harry but now it was even more terrifying. The Dark Lord would come after his son, no doubt about that. I'll train him, protect him and if it comes to it I will fight side by side with him, Snape thought fiercely. The Dark Lord had destroyed enough; he would not destroy Harry too. "It will be all right." He said, squeezing Harry's shoulder reassuringly."As I am sure all of you have heard Sirius Black has been cleared of all charges against him." Albus said once he had gotten everyone's attention. "Peter Pettigrew, believed to have been dead the last twelve years, was the one responsible for the murder of so many. He was hiding out here at Hogwarts and despite our efforts to trap and catch him; it would seem he has escaped."Murmuring broke out among the students and Dumbledore waited patiently for the Professors to quiet every one down. "Peter Pettigrew is extremely dangerous and will not hesitate to hurt anyone who gets in his way. Therefore, precautions must be taken and you will all need to be on your guard." Albus glanced at Minerva who gave him a pointed look. He knew she did not want the students to hear what they themselves feared, that Pettigrew would help Voldemort start another war. "We do not know what this will mean in regards to Volde-""Albus!" Minerva hissed. Until they knew for sure, she did not want the students to worry. There were only a few students here for the holiday break but word would spread once classes started up again.Harry had been listening but his eyes were watching the shocked faces of his peers and as he moved his gaze his mouth suddenly dropped open. "Crookshanks!""What?" Hermione turned and squealed in delight. "Crookshanks!""Is there something in his mouth?" Ron asked as he watched the cat trot over to them. There appeared to be a triumph gleam in the cat's eyes.Snape looked down in surprise as Crookshanks stopped in front of him and sat. His mouth dropped open when he saw a familiar looking rat dangling from his mouth. The rat was struggling to get free. "Pettigrew!" In an instant Snape had taken his wand and stunned the rat. Crookshanks dropped the now unconscious rat and turned to jump into Hermione's arms, purring contentedly."Interesting turn of events." Dumbledore remarked as he pointed his wand and turned the rat back into a man. There were gasps from the students as they saw Peter Pettigrew lying on the ground. "Incarcerous." Dumbledore incanted and thick ropes shot out and bound Pettigrew's wrists and ankles so that he couldn't get away. "Minerva, if you would alert the Aurors that are still outside and let them know that we require their assistance." He said calmly. "Pomona, if you would lead the students out of the Great Hall, except for these seven of course." He nodded at Harry and his friends."Of course Headmaster." Minerva and Pomona both nodded and quickly left the Great Hall with Professor Sprout leading the curious students out.Dumbledore looked thoughtfully at Pettigrew. "Rennervate." Pettigrew's beady eyes popped open and he instantly began struggling to get free from the ropes that bound him."You will not be getting away this time Peter." Dumbledore said and Peter froze when he saw the dark look on the Headmaster's face."Pro-Professor Dumbledore." Peter stammered. His eyes darted around and he visibly winced when he saw the murderous looks being given to him. Especially those by Sirius, Remus and Snape. "I-I was hiding…I had to hide from Sirius! He betrayed James and Lily!" He lied, hoping if he could get some sympathy he could make a break for it once again."How dare you!" Sirius lunged at the tied up man but was grabbed and pulled back by Remus. "Let me go!" He snarled at his friend as he struggled to get free. He wouldn't even need to use his wand; he would tear Pettigrew apart with his bare hands."Calm down Sirius!" Remus said as he tightened his hold on the angry Marauder."Sirius." Dumbledore said quietly yet with authority. He gave his former student a warning look and then looked back at Pettigrew. "We know the truth Peter. What happened in the shack has been stored in a pensive and already viewed by people in the Ministry. You are a wanted man now."Peter's beady eyes widened. "I didn't have a choice!" He whined. "The Dark Lord is too powerful!"Snape raised an eyebrow. "Is that so? Then where has he been for the past twelve years?"Peter glared at Snape. "Biding his time of course! I'll find him and help him!"Snape snorted. "Good luck with that as you are headed to Azkaban."Peter glare faded and fear replaced it. He looked up at Dumbledore. "No, please. I had no choice!" He begged his former Headmaster.Dumbledore shook his head and sadness shown on his face. "You did have a choice Peter and it is our choices that define us. And when we make the wrong choices, it is how we own up to them and try to make a difference that shows us who we are." He glanced at Snape briefly and then returned his gaze to Pettigrew. "You however continue to make the wrong choices and instead of admitting the wrong you have done, you continue to lie and make excuses. You know what you did Peter. You betrayed your friends who trusted you with their lives and you will now have to pay for it."Peter struggled in the ropes that bound him. Not giving thought to what Dumbledore had said he turned his attention to the one who had shown mercy on him before. "Dear Harry, such a sweet boy. You understand don't you?" He whined.Snape glowered. "I told you before not to talk to him!" He hissed. "Speak to him again and I will personally turn you back into a rat and cut you up for ingredients!"Peter paled slightly. He didn't doubt the man to do just what he had threatened."Will he be able to escape like Sirius did?" Harry spoke up as the thought just occurred to him. "Since he is an Animagus?""No Harry. This time the Ministry knows of his ability and his cell will be warded against him transforming." Dumbledore assured him.Peter began whimpering and continued to struggle even as Minerva and the Aurors came back. One of them appeared to be in charge as there was an air of authority about him that the others didn't have. Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt walked right up to the Headmaster and held out his hand. "Congratulations on his capture Professor Dumbledore. We were afraid he had gotten away for good." Kingsley said in a deep voice."Oh, I didn't capture him." Dumbledore said cheerfully."No?" Kingsley looked at Sirius who was still being restrained by Remus. "I'm sorry for your false imprisonment Mr. Black. It would appear you at least were able to help bring justice about." He nodded at Peter."I didn't catch him." Sirius muttered. He sighed. "Let go of me Moony. I won't kill him."Remus didn't let go of his arm. "Padfoot won't either." He said, knowing his friend all too well.Sirius scowled. Drat, he thought. "Fine." He said and finally was able to pull his arm free.Kingsley looked around, his brown eyes curious. "Who caught Pettigrew then? They should get a medal or a parade in their honor!"Harry couldn't help it. It was probably the stress of recent events but he began laughing at the thought of Crookshanks being the star of a parade with witches and wizards cheering and throwing flowers at him or something. Hermione began giggling too as well as Daphne. Soon Draco, Theo and Ron joined in the laughter.Snape bit his lip to hide the smile that wanted to escape. "Crookshanks is the hero of the day. He literally dropped Pettigrew at our feet." He smirked."And where is Mr. Crookshanks?" Kingsley asked. He looked bewildered when the adults began laughing as well."This is Crookshanks sir." Hermione held up her cat, who was still purring happily."Crookshanks caught Pettigrew in his rat form." Dumbledore informed Kingsley with twinkling eyes.A slow smile spread on Kingsley's face. "Fitting." He said with amusement in his voice. He nodded at his colleagues and they added more ropes to Pettigrew and then levitated him. Pettigrew went crazy then."No! You will all pay when the Dark Lord rises!" Peter yelled. "I will get my revenge when he kills all of you, starting with Potter!""Petrificus Totalus!" Snape lowered his wand as Peter's body stiffened and he couldn't talk anymore. Only Pettigrew's eyes could move and they were darting around in fear. "If you do not take him now, I will kill him." He warned in a low voice.Kingsley nodded and followed his colleagues out of the Great Hall with Pettigrew floating in front of him. Harry breathed a sigh of relief once they were gone. "It's over." He murmured in relief. He couldn't believe it. Pettigrew was finally going to pay for what he had done to his parents. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Snape's concerned face."Are you all right?" Snape asked. He patted Harry's shoulder when the child nodded."Chased by a ball of fire." Harry whispered suddenly as he remembered what Trelawney had said. Crookshanks fur certainly was the color of fire. Why hadn't he thought of it before? He noticed Snape's eyes widen in realization."Are we sure Pettigrew will not be able to escape?" Tracy asked nervously from where she stood close to Theo."As I said, his cell will have extra wards in place and I imagine extra Dementor's watching him." Dumbledore said. "He will not be underestimated again.""And he will finally get what is coming to him." Sirius spoke up and a huge grin was on his face. Twelve years he had waited for this moment. He couldn't believe it was finally here. The only thing that would make this moment more perfect was if his godson wanted to live with him. Deciding to think about that later he turned to where Hermione was holding Crookshanks and gave the cat a pet on his soft head. "Thanks my friend."Hermione grinned and held Crookshanks closer to her. "Good kitty." She said happily."I always knew he was a great cat." Ron remarked. He grinned sheepishly when his friends stared at him. "Well, I know now.""Yes, he is quite clever. If school was in session I would award Miss. Granger points for having such a smart cat." Snape said graciously. He shrugged. "Too bad term hasn't started yet."Draco, Daphne, Tracy and Theo snickered as they knew their Head of House was not one to give out points to anyone except a Slytherin. Harry just rolled his eyes."That is all right Severus. We can save any points you give for when the new term starts." Dumbledore said mischievously.Snape narrowed his eyes at his mentor and then sighed. "A hundred points for having such an extraordinary familiar." He said with a roll of his eyes. He noticed his Slytherins looked shocked. "Don't worry; I'm sure my House will catch up quickly on the first day of classes." He said casually.Harry snickered. "That means someone in Slytherin will earn a hundred points for showing up to class on time or tying their shoelaces correctly." He whispered loudly to Sirius. He laughed at the scowl Snape threw his way.Dumbledore hid a grin at the teasing Harry was doing with his guardian. Soon to be son, he corrected himself happily. He had hoped Snape would be able to see the real Harry and not just who he thought the child was but he had never expected a father and son bond to blossom. He was grateful for it as he knew that they both needed each other. Both my boys will be fine now, he thought. "I think a grand feast should take place tonight to celebrate." Dumbledore announced.Harry and his friends' grinned at each other and Ron patted his stomach. "Sounds good to me!" He said enthusiastically.Hermione rolled her eyes. "We'll have to roll him out of the Great Hall tonight, I just know it.""It's not fair he can eat so much and not gain anything." Daphne sighed in jealousy."So why don't we go flying until the feast?" Theo asked eagerly. "You know, with a certain Firebolt?" He looked hopefully at Harry.Harry turned his gaze to McGonagall who still had his broom. Minerva simply smiled and summoned the broom, handing it to Harry. "Here you go Mr. Potter.""Thanks." Harry turned to Sirius, holding the beautiful broom. "Thank you again Sirius. This is brilliant."Sirius grinned in response. "You know, it's been awhile since I've been flying." He mused out loud. "What about you Moony?"Remus chuckled. "It's been awhile for me too but I think I remember how.""Let's go!" Ron said enthusiastically.Harry looked at Snape. "What about you?"Snape snorted. Flying with the mutt and werewolf, yes that would be pleasant. "You go ahead Harry. I have a few things to do before the feast." He hesitated. "After dinner we will talk more about the adoption." He said in a quiet voice, low enough just for Harry to hear.Harry nodded. He was more than ready to make it official and was also curious as to what Snape wanted to tell him. "Okay."When Snape and Dumbledore were left alone in the Great Hall, Dumbledore could clearly see worry in the dark eyes. "Severus? Aren't you happy? What has occurred today will clearly change the course of the war. Without anyone to help him, Voldemort will surely stay gone for quite awhile. I still believe he will keep trying to come back however.""I'm sure he will. But yes, I am happy Pettigrew will finally pay for his crimes." Snape nodded. He sighed. "After the feast, I am telling Harry everything. For all I know after tonight he will want nothing to do with me.""Ahh." Dumbledore said thoughtfully. "You know my opinion on that. Harry is very forgiving. I believe he will see that you were a different man in the past and have done everything you could to make up for your past mistakes.""I wouldn't forgive me." Snape muttered. He cast a tempus. "I need to make some potions for the infirmary. I will see you at the feast Albus."Dumbledore nodded and watched Severus walk away. He was confident that in the end, Harry would still want Severus in his life. If only you would just forgive yourself my boy, he thought sadly.HPHPHPHPFlying had been brilliant and had turned into a game of impromptu Quidditch. Despite not being on a broom in awhile Sirius was a very good flier. After letting everyone have a turn on the Firebolt Harry had finally used it himself and had been amazed at how fast he had been able to go. He couldn't wait for the next Quidditch game though he wondered if he would be playing as a Gryffindor by then. He still wasn't sure how he felt about that. He still felt like a Gryffindor but he also felt like he belonged in Slytherin. He would just have to wait and see what would happen once classes started up again.The feast truly was a celebration with party streamers and balloons. The entire Weasley family had been invited since Pettigrew had unknowingly resided in their home for twelve years. After greeting Ron and assuring herself that he was unharmed she had immediately engulfed Harry into a hug. "Oh Harry, I'm so happy that you are safe!" She exclaimed. "I can't believe what you have all been through the last couple of days!"Harry hugged Mrs. Weasley back. "We're all okay Mrs. Weasley." He assured her.Mrs. Weasley released him and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief she pulled out of her sleeve. "I know dear. It's just the thought of that rat being in our home, cared for by us and all this time…" She shook her head."You had no way of knowing." Snape said absently as he looked around the Hall. He grimaced slightly as he observed all the laughter and smiles going around. He was as happy as everyone else that Pettigrew was in Azkaban but honestly, the streamers, balloons, and party favors were a bit much. He was taken aback when suddenly Mrs. Weasley grabbed him into a hug."And you! You're taking such good care of Harry aren't you? You've been a wonderful guardian for him." Mrs. Weasley sobbed happily, not noticing that Snape was trying to push her away. She had been worried when Ron had written her about Harry being in Slytherin and Severus becoming his guardian. But it was easy to see how much healthier and happier Harry looked now, she felt bad for doubting that Severus could be a good parent.Harry bit his lip to try and not laugh as Snape finally managed to escape Mrs. Weasley's hug but the shocked look on his guardians face was too much and he began snickering. He couldn't help adding, "It's going to be official Mrs. Weasley. He's going to adopt me." He grinned as she made a move to hug Snape again but her attention was turned to Sirius by Snape."Have you said hello to Black yet? Poor mu- I mean man, he had to endure Azkaban for twelve long years." Snape quickly said. He couldn't care less about the mutt but he was not about to be hugged again. Honestly, over-emotional Gryffindor, he thought to himself as he shot Harry a glare. Little impertinent brat."Oh, look how thin the poor dear looks." Mrs. Weasley quickly bustled over to Sirius and began fussing over him.Snape turned to Harry. "Don't think you won't pay for that." He hissed.Harry laughed and waved his hand dismissively. "It's worth it Dad." His eyes were bright with mirth.Snape had been about to scold the boy but stilled at Harry's words. Dad. He liked that. He liked it more than he ever thought he would. But he still needed to talk to Harry about his past and he feared that after tonight he would never hear Harry call him that wonderful word again.HPHPHPHP"I can't believe school starts up again in a couple of days." Ron said forlornly. He scooped more pot roast onto his plate."Oh cheer up. Just think how everyone will want to hear about your near death experience." Hermione teased."I'm not looking forward to it either." Daphne admitted. She looked at Harry. "It's going to be weird not having you in Slytherin anymore."Draco, Theo and Tracey looked up from their plates. "Oh yeah." Draco said slowly. "I forgot this was temporary.""We'll all still be friends right?" Tracey asked worriedly."Of course we will!" Hermione exclaimed.Harry nodded. "It's going to be weird though. A lot of good came from me being in Slytherin." He glanced at the table where the adults were sitting. Who would have thought he would have gotten a parent out of being placed in Slytherin? His eyes met Daphne's and he knew she understood how he was feeling."Maybe you can get into a fight on the first day of class again and end up back in Slytherin." Theo suggested. He shrugged when his friends laughed. "It might work."Draco rolled his eyes. "He better not, he'd probably end up in Hufflepuff this time." He joked.Harry shook his head in amusement. Gryffindor or Slytherin, he was grateful for the new friends he had made and the old friends who had stood by him. He was grateful for all he had learned this past term, for Sirius being free and most of all for gaining a family.HPHPHPHP"Harry, we need to talk about the adoption." Snape said slightly pacing in front of the couch where Harry was sitting. The celebration had ended an hour ago and he and Harry were back in their quarters. Snape knew he needed to come clean now before he lost his nerve."You still want to do it right?" Harry asked quickly.Snape stopped pacing and threw him an exasperated look. "Of course I do. You're my son in every way that matters." He sighed and continued pacing. "There is something you need to know though. And it may change your mind about being adopted by me."Harry frowned. "You mentioned this before. What is it?" What could possibly be so bad?"You know I was a Death Eater." Snape said quietly. "I told you that the Dark Lord had gone too far. I wasn't happy like I thought I would be being a Death Eater. But instead of trying to find a way out then, I thought if I proved my worth to the Dark Lord it would be better. I overheard a prophecy, part of a prophecy. It spoke of his downfall and although I didn't hear everything, I reported what I did overhear to the Dark Lord.""Prophecy? It was a real one?" Harry had never thought of prophecy's being real as his Divination class was a joke but after hearing Trelawney in the infirmary, he realized there may be something to it after all.Snape's face was pained. "Yes, it was real. It spoke of a child who would be born at the end of July and would cause the destruction of the Dark Lord. For me, I didn't take it seriously but I knew the Dark Lord was interested in Divination. I thought if I told him of what I had heard he would consider me a worthy follower.""A child born at the end of July?" Harry whispered. "Me?" His eyes widened."I didn't know it would be you." Snape's voice was also a whisper. "I didn't even believe it; I just wanted to look good in front of the Dark Lord. There were two children born at the end of July and both sets of parents were in the Order. The Dark Lord believed the prophecy and decided it would be James and Lily's child who would be the one to fulfill it. He knew how strong of a witch and wizard they were."Harry felt himself shaking with emotion. "So…they died because Voldemort believed a partial prophecy? That's why he targeted them, to get to me?" Harry felt numb. Voldemort had been specifically after him. Harry had thought he had gone after his parents because they were fighting against him. Pain, grief and guilt coursed through him. "He told her to step aside." Harry said softly.Snape nodded, running a hand through his hair. "The Dark Lord knew that I cared for Lily. I believe he tried to spare her as my reward." He turned away, unable to look Harry in the eyes. "I knew I had to do something so I went to Dumbledore and begged him to hide Lily, James and you. The truth is Harry…""What?" Harry asked thickly."I loved your mother." Snape looked at Harry and he could see the despair in Snape's eyes, the pain. "I've always loved her. After I switched to the side of the light, I agreed to protect you for her." He gave a disgusted laugh. "I hated you because of James and yet would do anything to protect you for your mother."Harry drew in a breath. "You-you only cared about saving her didn't you? You didn't care for my Dad or me to be spared."Snape looked shattered. "At the time, I only thought of her. But I knew she would defend you to her last breath. After I told Dumbledore everything, I became a spy for him and your parents went under the Fidelius charm.""And from there they trusted Pettigrew who betrayed them." Harry said dully."I am not a good man. I have never pretended to be." Snape said slowly. "And Harry, I will not blame you in the least for hating me. If I hadn't joined the Death Eaters, if I hadn't spoken of the prophecy to the Dark Lord, your parents would still be alive. It is my fault."Harry was silent. Too many emotions were running through him. Anger, sadness, confusion and grief swirled around. He stood up and began pacing slightly, much like Snape had been doing. Part of him wanted to yell and curse the older wizard but another part of him could feel the man's pain and regret. He didn't know what to think."It means nothing I know, but I am sorry." Snape whispered brokenly. "Nothing can ever make it right but I am so sorry.""Is that why you are adopting me? For my mother?" Harry asked suddenly. He needed to know for sure."No." Snape answered honestly. "I protected you in the beginning for Lily but this year has changed everything. I still want to protect you and even train you in case the Dark Lord does come back someday. But I care about you; I enjoy spending time with you. I want to help guide you through your teenager years and give you a real home. I want to adopt you Harry, because you are my son and I love you. I know I have no right to feel that way about you but I do."Harry saw the sincerity in Snape's eyes and knew he was telling the truth. He sighed and walked over to the other side of the room as he thought about what he had just learned. Despite what Snape had done in the past, he had tried to make up for it. He had turned to the light and protected Harry. And these last several months, he had taken Harry in. He had given him everything a real parent gives their child, including love."It was a mistake." Harry said slowly, thinking of Snape becoming a Death Eater and passing along the prophecy to Voldemort. Harry knew of making mistakes. He had gone after the Sorcerer's Stone and let his friend's join him and Ron had almost been killed. He hadn't told an adult about hearing a voice in the walls last year and if he had, perhaps Hermione would never have been petrified and Ginny wouldn't have almost died in the Chamber. He understood about making bad decisions. And passing along the prophecy, well, he believed that Snape wouldn't have thought it could be true. Snape's disdain for Divination had always been obvious enough. Besides, Pettigrew was the one who deliberately betrayed his parents. And Voldemort was the one who had killed them.Snape thought Harry's comment was in regard to being his guardian. He drew in a breath, feeling his heart sink. He had told himself Harry wouldn't forgive him nor did he deserve to be forgiven. "I understand." He said, trying to mask the hurt and sadness he was feeling. "Black of course will happily take you in so you still do not have to worry about returning to the Dursley's or anything."Harry looked at him in surprise. "What are you talking about?""You don't want me to be your guardian anymore, it was a mistake." Snape sighed. "I wish I-""No, that wasn't what I meant!" Harry shook his head and despite everything, he laughed. "I meant what you did was a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes, even ones that hurt people. I have too. But you owned up to it, you have tried to make it right.""It is still my fault." Snape murmured. "If I hadn't-""If Pettigrew hadn't betrayed his friends, if Sirius hadn't thought to make Pettigrew the Secret Keeper, if my parents had made Dumbledore the Secret Keeper…" Harry sighed. "There are a lot of ifs."Snape stayed quiet. "What I did was unforgivable." He said finally. "As I said, I am not a good man."Harry looked at the man who had saved his life more than once. "Don't say that about my Dad." He said steadily.Snape just looked at him.Harry walked over to him. "You're my Dad." He repeated. "The past is past and the fact that you told me the truth, never mind that you become a spy and would have again…I-I think you are really brave." He said honestly. "I still want to be adopted by you.""But how could you?" Snape asked incredulously. "After what I did? You should be as disgusted with me as I am." Harry then said three words that shocked him."I forgive you."Snape shut his eyes, unable to believe what he was hearing. Harry forgave him? He still thought of him as his Dad and wanted to be adopted by him? Albus had been right about the child.Snape opened his eyes when he felt Harry hugging him. He closed his arms around him and hugged him back. This hug he did not mind. "Thank you." He said hoarsely. "I don't deserve it but I am grateful for it."Harry pulled back. "I think you do deserve it." He said with an easy going shrug. His eyes brightened. "So when can we get started on the adoption?"Snape still couldn't believe it. "You do know that Black would be more relaxed and fun as a parent than I will be?""Yeah so he told me." Harry grinned. "I would be able to stay up as late as I want, eat whatever I want, study whenever." He shrugged again. "Sirius will be a great Uncle. I want a father."Snape gave a laugh of relief and disbelief. "Then I will start the paperwork today." Harry had forgiven him and maybe someday, Snape would be able to truly forgive himself.HPHPHPHPSnape, Professor McGonagall, Harry were standing in the Headmasters office. Dumbledore took the Sorting Hat down from its shelf and the hat yawned. "Isn't it a little early?" The hat grumbled."I am very sorry to disturb your sleep but we need you to clarify something for us. We would like you to once again sort Harry Potter." Dumbledore explained.The hat turned towards Harry. "Ahh, yes. You were most difficult to place. Well, let's see then." The hat said impatiently.Dumbledore placed the hat on Harry's head where it sat in silence for awhile."Well?" Snape asked exasperatedly. "This shouldn't take all day.""Severus." Dumbledore sighed. "Have some patience."The hat stayed silent and then suddenly yelled out, making them all jump. "Slytherdor!""What in the world does that mean?" Minerva huffed. "You have to choose a House.""I did. Slytherdor." The hat stubbornly insisted. "The boy is both."Dumbledore chuckled. Snape was looking at Harry contemplatively and Minerva just looked frustrated. Harry just looked confused."So what now? How can I be both?" Harry asked in confusion.Dumbledore thanked the hat and then put it back on the shelf so it could go back to sleep. "This has happened before but not for many years. It was even before I was a student in Hogwarts. A student was sorted into two Houses. The student was female and became a Ravenpuff.""How did they deal with it?" Snape asked curiously."From what I read, she was in both houses. She could sleep in either dorm, eat at either table, and points were shared. Points that were given or taken were split between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff." Dumbledore answered."Well, there you have it. Any points Harry gains will be for Slytherin and any points he loses will be taken from Gryffindor." Snape smirked."I do not think so Severus Snape." Minerva snapped."Now, now do not let your claws out Minerva." Snape said smoothly."Points gained and earned would be split evenly." Dumbledore interjected, hoping to stave off an argument.Harry tilted his head to the side. He actually liked the idea. He wouldn't lose either House and maybe he could continue to help unite the two Houses. "What about Quidditch?" He asked suddenly.Dumbledore shrugged. "You can play for both Houses.""I would continue what you are doing now. Play with either House against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw yet don't play against Gryffindor or Slytherin." Snape suggested. "And don't feel pressure to play in all the games either. Your health and grades still come first."Harry hid a grin at the parental tone. "I know." He frowned. "Wait, what will the other students think?""It's not their decision." Snape responded."Some may have a problem though." Minerva spoke up. "You will need to be prepared for that.""You aren't mad that I want to be in Slytherin too?" Harry asked hesitantly.Minerva smiled gently. "No. I'm simply pleased that we are not losing you all together. I am worried about some of the reactions we will see, especially after how certain students have treated you so far.""We will have a House meeting, a joint House meeting." Snape spoke up. He didn't want to, he got enough of those Gryffindor vacant expressions during class but he wanted to make sure both Houses understood that bullying would not be tolerated.Minerva looked a little impressed and nodded. "That sounds like a good idea Severus."Harry snorted. "Better make sure no one has their wands on them."Snape gave Harry a scowl even though the child had a point. "I want to make it clear that whether they are happy about it or not, no forms of bullying will be tolerated. If anyone has a problem with it, they can keep it to themselves."Minerva nodded. "I agree.""Everyone will adjust." Dumbledore assured them. "Harry already has friends in both Houses, the rest will follow."TBC: Hope you enjoyed this chapter! One more to go!

Disclaimer:  I do not own Harry Potter. All characters belong to J.K. Rowling.A/N: This is the last chapter! I do plan to do a one-shot showing moments of fourth year followed by the sequel which will be set in fifth year. It will probably be a few weeks as I am still working on the outlines and want to get several chapters done before I start posting. Thank you all for being on this journey with me!Snape and Minerva were discussing the joint meeting they would be having with their Houses while Dumbledore chatted pleasantly with Harry when suddenly an official looking owl flew in through the window and circled above Snape before settling on his shoulder, lifting its leg to deliver the letter attached. Snape took the letter and thanked the owl, who hooted and flew back out the window. "It's from the Ministry." Snape said as he looked at the official seal on the envelope. He glanced at Harry.Harry's eyes widened. They had been waiting for the official adoption papers for the last several days. He watched eagerly as Snape opened the letter. Snape's dark eyes quickly read through the note and then wordlessly he handed it to Harry.Harry grabbed it and skimmed through the document. "It's official!" He beamed. "The adoption is official!""Congratulations!" Minerva said with a genuinely happy smile."Wonderful!" Dumbledore clapped his hands together. "How about some Butterbeer all around? And maybe some cake too…and pudding!" He summoned one of the Hogwarts elves."Albus, honestly." Minerva sighed as she then tried to argue with Dumbledore about the amount of sweets he was trying to order. "We just had breakfast!" She scolded him.Harry just laughed and then looked at the letter again. "I can't believe it's real." He looked at Snape.Snape smirked, his eyes bright with satisfaction. "I assure you, it is very real. There's no going back now." He teased before his tone became more serious. "I couldn't be more pleased or proud to call you my son." He pulled Harry into a one armed hug.Harry grinned up at him. "Thanks Dad."HPHPHPHPThe rest of the year went relatively smoothly for Harry. The joint House meeting had been interesting. Blaise and his cronies had scowled the whole way through, although that was to be expected. Harry had noticed upset looks from some of the Gryffindors as well, including McLaggen and Williams. They had immediately glared at Harry and whispered to each other when the news broke. Even Dean and Seamus had looked bothered by the idea. Of course with two of the strictest Professors in the room, no one dared voice a complaint. And as word got out throughout the school, Harry could tell that there were some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs who now regarded him suspiciously. It was reminiscent of his second year when almost everyone had thought he was the heir of Slytherin. Of course, the bullies who had been the catalyst for Harry being in Slytherin, Jeremy Stretton and Grant Page, were happy to share their views on how Harry was training to become a Dark Wizard with anyone who would listen. However, Harry also had many supporters who weren't bothered by the idea of him being in two Houses at all. Harry alternated between which dorms he slept and mostly spent his time evenly in the common rooms. The news of his adoption, however, had really shocked the students and some of the Hufflepuff first years had actually cried when they found out the scary potions professor was Harry's father now. Snape had been pleased with their reaction which had amused his son.Harry had kept in touch with Sirius through letters as his godfather recuperated from being in Azkaban for so long. Sirius had even shown up a few times to visit with Harry and though the Animagus and Snape tried to get along, their contempt for each other was obvious. When Harry had shown Remus and Sirius the adoption papers, Remus had warmly congratulated both of them. Sirius, on the other hand, had merely stiffened and mumbled out his congratulations in a monotone voice. Harry could only hope one day Sirius would accept Snape as his Dad and the two of them would actually get along, although he wasn't holding his breath.Harry had been sad when he found out that Remus had put in his resignation at the end of the year. At first Harry assumed it was because he wanted to help Sirius adjust and though that was true, Harry had gotten a feeling there was another reason as well. When he had asked Remus, his professor had lightly brushed him off by being evasive and his Dad had simply snorted and said not to question a good thing. Harry had just rolled his eyes and let the matter drop. For now.HPHPHPHPNow Harry was seeing his friends off for the summer before he went home with his Dad to Spinner's End. Harry had already sent Hedwig there even though he hadn't been there yet himself but he couldn't wait. While he considered Hogwarts home, it was nice to know he had another home away from school, a real home where he belonged. He was a little anxious about it though, he knew Snape didn't have fond memories of the house."You're going to write as soon as you get settled in?" Hermione asked Harry anxiously as the Hogwarts Express pulled up."Yes Mum." Harry teased."You guys are all going to come to the Burrow to visit this summer right?" Ron asked. "We can play Quidditch with the twins.""And me!" Ginny piped up.Ron rolled his eyes. "And Ginny." He amended."Your parents won't mind all of us visiting at the same time?" Draco asked.Ron shrugged. "Not at all. The more the merrier in my Mum's opinion.""Apparently, with all the kids she has." Draco commented. "Oi!" He glared at Harry who had accidently jostled him."It sounds fun to me." Theo said and Tracey nodded in agreement."I wanna go too!" Astoria said eagerly."Want to, not wanna." Daphne corrected her gently. She glanced at her friends. "We will see okay?" She smiled at her sister.Astoria appeared satisfied with that and quickly gave Harry a hug. "Take good care of my Nova okay?"Harry laughed. Astoria was crazy about Nova and somehow had decided that the snake was hers and Harry simply took care of Nova for her. "I will." He assured her. He hugged Hermione and Tracy and received thumps on the back from Ron, Draco and Theo. Daphne was the last to board the train."I'm really happy that everything worked out for you this year." Daphne said softly."Me too." Harry looked into her dark blue eyes. "Thank you for your support this year. You really helped me a lot." He admitted.Daphne smiled. "You're a really good person Harry. You deserve to be happy. You've also helped start the bridge of the Houses getting along." There was a twinge of admiration in her voice."There is still a lot of work to do on that bridge." Harry joked.Daphne laughed and nodded. "True. So…if I write you, you'll write back?""Yes." Harry said immediately. "And we'll all meet up at the Burrow."Daphne nodded. "It should be fun." She stepped forward and hugged Harry. "Have fun this summer, okay?" She said softly.Harry pulled back, feeling himself blush. Her hair smelled really good. "You too." He murmured.He waited until the train pulled away and then returned to the castle. It was time to go home.HPHPHPHPHarry met Snape in Dumbledore's office where his Dad had been having an end of the year meeting with the Headmaster."Ahh, hello Harry. Did you see your friends off?" Dumbledore asked with a smile as he held out a small bowl of lemon drops."Yes sir." Harry grinned and took a lemon drop."We can floo home from this office." Snape informed Harry. He hesitated. "It's…not a grand house by any means though I have spent some time over the last couple of months trying to fix it up." His tone was apologetic.Harry suppressed a sigh. It wasn't the first time Snape had apologized for his childhood home and Harry hadn't even seen it yet! It's not like Harry cared what the house looked like or how big it was. Living in a box with a parent that cared about him was still an upgrade from living at the Dursley's. "I can't wait to see it Dad. I already know it's going to be brilliant." He looked at Snape in concern. "Are you sure you don't mind staying there over the summer?"Snape shook his head. "No, not now I don't."Dumbledore cleared his throat. "I – ah, have sent your house-elf there to…erm…fix it up as well. He already took your belongings there." Dumbledore took a step back as Snape whirled around on him."I do not have, or need, a house-elf!" Snape snapped."Well, this one volunteered." Dumbledore shrugged, his eyes twinkling. "He will work for you yet still be a free elf. He will also still work here at Hogwarts during the year."Snape gritted his teeth. "A Hogwarts house-elf actually volunteered to work for me?" He asked incredulously."Well yes, to serve you and Harry. You know how loyal they are and very protective, especially this one." Dumbledore smiled mysteriously. "Can you guess?" He asked Harry.Harry frowned in thought for a moment and then his eyes lit up. "Dobby!" He said excitedly.There was suddenly a loud pop and there stood Dobby, wearing three different colored sweaters and several pairs of mismatched socks. He beamed. "Harry Potter sir! Dobby has missed you!" He shook Harry's hand enthusiastically."It's so good to see you Dobby! You look…great." Harry grinned at all the mismatched clothes.Snape narrowed his eyes. "Dobby? You used to be the Malfoy's house elf, correct?"Dobby nodded. "Yes, Malfoy senior was not very nice to Dobby but young Malfoy was not cruel to Dobby. Mrs. Malfoy treated us house-elves much kinder as well. But Dobby was so happy to be freed by Harry Potter sir! And now Dobby will happily serve you and Professor Snape!""We do not need a house-elf." Snape huffed. "You are free so why would you want to work for us?"Dobby's already big eyes widened further. "Dobby loves being free but Dobby also loves to work! Dobby is proud to work here at Hogwarts and is honored to serve Harry Potter sir and his father. Dobby has already begun to prepare yours home."Snape gritted his teeth. "Our house should have extra wards on them." He said slowly. "How did you get in without my permission?"Dobby smiled brightly. "Headmaster Dumbledores made sure I could get in!""Now Severus," Dumbledore began. "Dobby is completely trustworthy and – please put your wand down!"Harry bit his lip to keep the laughter that was building inside of him from escaping as he grabbed his Dad's arm to prevent him from hexing the Headmaster."You's can trust Dobby." Dobby said eagerly.Snape lowered his wand and glared at the Headmaster. "You should have run this by me first Albus. I do not want the wards around my house messed with.""The wards are just has secure as you made them." Dumbledore said calmly. "House-elves usually can get past most wards as it is so I made sure that Dobby is the only house-elf who can enter your home."Snape sighed. "Anything else?" He asked sarcastically.Dumbledore cleared his throat. "Well, your home is already connected to the floo network for my office as well as the infirmary. I thought I would connect it to number 12 Grimmauld Place as well and the Weasley's…""I believe I should have some say over who is connected to my home Albus!" Snape hissed.Dumbledore nodded. "Yes of course. I didn't do it but it is something to think about."Not for long, Snape thought darkly. He would not have it to where people could come into his home without him knowing. "If they want to come over they can contact us ahead of time and ask, not just barge in." Perhaps he would set up a charm to work like a muggle doorbell on his floo. That way he could at least ignore anyone he didn't want to bother with. Like the mutt.Harry stayed silent. He could see his Dad's point, as Snape was a very private person. Personally Harry didn't mind if the Weasley's or Sirius were connected to their floo but he understood where his dad was coming from. "I agree." He said easily.Snape looked surprised for a second but then nodded and gave the Headmaster a smug look.Dumbledore merely smiled and then looked at Dobby who was waving at all the portraits in the office. "Dobby asked to work at your house this summer, and he will keep any secrets and keep his silence about your home just as the Hogwarts elves do here.""Dobby will be most honored Professor Snape sir." Dobby said solemnly. "And you wills not needs to pay Dobby like Headmaster Dumbledores does.""What do you get paid Dobby?" Harry asked curiously, biting his lip to keep from laughing at the Headmaster being called Dumbledores."Dobby was offered ten Galleons a week and weekends off." Dobby shivered slightly. "But that was too much so Dobby talked him down to five Galleons a week and every other weekend off."Harry smothered a laugh. "I think that's great Dobby. Um, we can pay you the same right Dad?" He looked hopefully at Snape.Snape sighed. "That's fine." He muttered with a glare at the Headmaster."Dobby will not expect pay this summer, Dobby wants to serve cause he is so happy for Harry Potter sir." Dobby said tearfully."Um," Harry didn't feel right not paying something to Dobby. "How about a new pair of socks every week?" He suggested.Dobby's eyes lit up. "Socks are Dobby's favorite clothes Harry Potter sir!" He frowned. "Every other week." He insisted."Okay." Harry said, knowing Dobby would be stubborn about this. Maybe he would add some sweaters or scarves as well."And Dobby will never speak ill of either of you although Headmaster Dumbledores said Dobby could call him a barmy old codger if he wishes!" The eccentric house-elf gave a nervous giggle."I have a few other names for you that suit Professor Dumbledore." Snape offered. "If you are interested."Dumbledore gave a sniff. "Honestly Severus." His eyes were twinkling however."Dobby will see you at home!" Dobby beamed and then disappeared with a loud pop.Snape sighed. "I haven't been at the house for the past two weeks. What has he been doing to it?" He demanded to know.Dumbledore sat down at his desk. "I believe he merely cleaned more and perhaps enlarged certain rooms. Some of the furniture may be different now too." He added thoughtfully.Snape closed his eyes telling himself it would do no good to hex the Headmaster. "Let's go Harry. I need to see the damage." He muttered.Harry grinned and offered Dumbledore a wave as Snape threw down the glittery green floo powder in the fireplace and father and son flooed home.HPHPHPHPOn the outside, the two-story brick, terraced house looked slightly worn down. There was a river nearby and a disused mill not too far off. It was a quiet street, Spinner's End, and no one looking at the house would guess two wizards now lived there.Indeed, when Snape and Harry stepped out of the floo Snape's mouth dropped open. Harry looked around with a huge grin. "Wow Dad, this is great!"Snape narrowed his eyes as he looked around his childhood home. The sitting room was at least twice the size it had been and now had new luxurious furniture done in gold and soft browns with hints of blues and green throughout. He stalked into the kitchen and saw that the room here was also much larger with new appliences; a large cream colored refrigerator, a new oven and stove and the dark green granite counters were practically sparkling.Harry coughed. "I take it the house didn't look like this when you were here last?" He asked mildly."No." Snape said curtly as he made his way to the small library he had. He stopped in the doorway. Correction, the large library he had. The elf had even included new bookcases waiting to be filled. His normal modest desk was replaced with a bigger antique office desk and leather chair."Are you mad?" Harry asked quietly from behind."I'm not mad." Snape answered. Actually, he was quite happy with the changes. It looked less like his childhood home and more like a new home that he was going to live in with his son. In the past he rarely ever came here so he never bothered with upgrading the place. The only room he had really concentrated on fixing was Harry's. "It is quite nice." He admitted.Harry grinned.They both jumped when Dobby appeared with a crackling pop. "Do Harry Potter sir and Professor Snape sir like it?" Dobby asked hopefully."You can just call me Harry, Dobby." Harry said with a fond smile.Dobby grabbed his ears and yanked. "O-okay Harry." He sounded nervous. He looked at Snape."Professor Snape without the sir will suffice." Snape snorted and walked back into the sitting room. He paused. "Did you do anything to my lab?"Dobby shook his head. "No, Headmaster Dumbledores told me that was off limits unless you ask Dobby."Snape nodded. Smart move on Albus's part. He did not like anyone messing around in his lab as he had it organized just right."Would you be wanting lunch now?" Dobby asked eagerly.Snape nodded. "Yes, thank you Dobby. Just let us know when it is ready." He wasn't used to having a house elf serve him, even at Hogwarts he rarely asked for their assistance. But he might as well resign to the fact that he and Harry had one now, thanks to that meddling old coot. "Shall we look upstairs?" He asked his son.Harry nodded enthusiastically. Once upstairs Snape showed him what had once been Snape's bedroom as a child. Harry looked around at the deep blues and brown tones in his new room. The bed had a deep blue comforter; there was a nice sized bookcase, desk, closet, and a dresser. "This is so brilliant!" Harry exclaimed happily.Snape nodded approvingly. He was happy with the changes. Dobby had kept the colors and furniture he himself had picked out for Harry but had made the room larger and added a window seat where the river could be viewed. "I suppose I should see what has been done to my room." Snape remarked. He went across the hall, aware that Harry was following him.His own room was similar to Harry's except the colors were done in dark green and brown. "I must say this is better than I had hoped for." He commented. "I had feared red and gold everywhere."Harry laughed. "Dobby wouldn't dare."Snape cleared his throat. "If you would like your room done in those colors, I would not object." Out loud anyway, he thought with a grimace.To Snape's relief, Harry shook his head. "I'm not just a Gryffindor anymore." He reminded his Dad. "No, I really like my room just the way it is." He smiled softly. "My own room without any locks on it." He joked.Snape frowned. Worthless Dursley's, he thought darkly. "You deserve your own room Harry, a nice room where you will never be locked in." He said fiercely."I know Dad." Harry said with a smile.Snape lead him back downstairs. "You can fly in the backyard without being seen by any muggles as long as you stay within the wards. You will feel a tingle if you get too close to them. I do expect you to start your summer homework early and not leave it to the last minute. I will be checking it over, of course.""Of course." Harry rolled his eyes. He grinned at the scowl his Dad sent his way. It was nice, to have a parent wanting to look over his homework. Most kids probably wouldn't like it but as Harry had never had it, he welcomed it."Lunch is on the table Harry and Professor Snape!" Dobby announced from the kitchen."Thank you Dobby."HPHPHPHP Snape and Harry spent the evening playing chess and then ended up on the sofa, each reading as they drank the hot cocoa Dobby had made for them."Dad, do you think Voldemort will ever come back?" Harry asked suddenly.Snape put his book down. "He could someday. It is a possibility that we cannot rule out." Snape admitted. "All it would take is for one of his followers to decide to find and help him the way Pettigrew would have done. However, no one has tried to help him yet. For now, I believe we are safe yet we will remain on alert just in case."Harry nodded in understanding and went back to his book.When Harry's eyes started to close as he was reading Quidditch through the Ages, Snape closed his own book. "I think it is time for bed."Harry yawned and nodded. "Goodnight." He got up and started to move towards the stairs but then paused and turned back towards Snape.Snape stood up. "Is there something wrong Harry?" He asked in concern."I just wanted to thank you Dad." Harry said softly."For what?" Snape asked, perplexed."For saving my life this past year." Harry said sincerely.Snape shook his head and his dark eyes softened. He stepped forward and pulled his son into a hug. "No Harry. Thank you for saving mine."The End.A/N: Thank you again so much for your support and interest in this story. I had so much fun and hopefully you'll join me for the upcoming sequel! See you on the flip side! =)
