Keep to yourself, don't ask questions, and don't stare at anyone. Following these three simple commandments were the unwritten rules of Knockturn Alley. Follow these and you will be left alone, and in Knockturn Alley the one thing you wanted above all else was to be left alone.The hooded figure followed these rules to the letter as it slalomed through the waifs and strays of the alleyway, the cowl pulled tight over his face and head bent low so that only the tip of his nose protruded enough to be visible."Watch it!" ordered a gruff-looking man buffeted out of the way. The hooded individual ignored him and continued on his single minded journey."I said 'watch it'!" reiterated the man, slapping a plate size hand down on the shoulder of the stranger.The covered person spun around with a surprising speed that caught the man off guard. There was a sudden flash of red, which caused a startled old woman nearby to scream out in shock, and the man crumpled down onto the pavement under the power of the Stunning Spell. Despite a number of people being present, there was silence all around.The hooded figure looked down at the body of the man, prodding it carefully with a boot, before raising its head to meet the eyes of the old woman, who immediately looked away and tried to seem as if she hadn't noticed any confrontation. Others in the alley did the same as the hooded person turned in their direction, each person suddenly pretended to be very interested in the slab of pavement just below their feet. Satisfied that nothing else was going to happen, the covered figure moved off once again, leaving the prone man behind to have his pockets picked clean by the more opportunistic denizens of the alley.Turning right the figure left the relative hustle of the main part of Knockturn Alley and disappeared down one of the numerous side streets that branched out from it. A few more turns and he stopped at a dead end, huge imposing walls rearing up in front as well as on either side. Pushing a gloved hand into a pocket to retrieve a worn, folded scrap of parchment with small spidery writing on it, the figure muttered some words from within the confines of the cowl.A low rumbling sounded as the bricks slowly parted in the wall to reveal a hidden door. A hand reached out and pushed it open.Stepping through the doorway the figure found itself in a dark hallway. Up ahead was the faint noise of music being played. Ominous pictures hung from the wall, its inhabitants watching the cloaked person warily as it passed by them. At the end of the hall was a large velvet curtain blocking the way, the figure pushed its way through and stepped into the room beyond.The music was louder now. The figured looked across to the source, an old gramophone, slowly whirling away in the corner of the room, echoing out a slow thoughtful melody.The room was decorated very lushly. Expensive looking ornaments adorned various shelves and side tables, a dusty collection of books were mounted on one side of the room, while a plush carpet filled the middle of it. Directly ahead was a large desk, intricately carved in the finest detail. Behind the desk, sat a high back chair, it was swivelled away so that the hooded figure could only see one arm of the occupant who was using a gloved hand to conduct in time to the music."Ahem," the cough was muffled slightly under the cowl, and drew no response from the resident of the chair. The figure repeated the gesture, slightly louder this time, "ahem."The hand paused in its conducting and was turned to wave a finger at the figure before returning to its musical role. The figure waited impatiently as the music continued until it gradually faded away.The occupant of the chair, who was still turned away, reached down onto the table and picked up a wand. A quiet muttering and movement was enough to send the gramophone into a still state."You can say what you like about Muggles," said a gravely voice from within in the confines of the chair, "but there are some things that they can get right on occasion. Are you a fan of Mozart?""I couldn't really say," replied a male voice evenly."No?" asked the seated man, "you should give him a chance, you're missing out. Beethoven is also good, very powerful, but after his openings, to be honest, he does tend to get a little boring…""Look," snapped the cloaked man, "I'm here…""I know why you are here," the seated man replied coolly cutting him off, "people only come to me for one reason. You have a problem, and you need it taken care of.""Quite," agreed the hooded man, "in fact, I have three problems.""As long as you have enough money you can have as many problems as you like."The hooded man reached into his pocket and pulled out a small bag which he threw down onto the table. It gave the unmistakable clink of coins bouncing together as it landed. The chair swivelled slightly and its inhabitant reached a hand out to pick up the coin purse. The sleeve on the arm pulled back a little to reveal a skin of dark green scales. The hooded man shivered slightly at the sight."This feels about right," admitted the man in the chair, bouncing the small bag up and down in his hand, "so, what are the three problems?""These," there was a soft sound as the hooded man dropped a couple of photographs down on the table, which were immediately scooped up by the owner of the scaled arm, who examined the first one, "that's Enoch Feverence, general treasure hunter and, up until a few months ago, a teacher at Hogwarts.""Ahh yes," muttered the voice, "I remember this fellow being in the Daily Prophet, complaints of destruction of historic Egyptian artefacts I seem to recall, although I believed he claimed that he stopped some religious sect from destroying the world or some such nonsense. A man like that would step on a lot of toes, and I'm guessing you have sore feet?""Yes," replied the hooded man, clenching his jaw."Now this is much more interesting," continued the seated man, looking at the second picture, "what could these two have possibly done to you?""Does it matter?" asked the hooded man tersely."I suppose not," came the reply, "any special instructions?""Not with Feverence, but with the other two make it look like an accident.""Any particular reason?""Because I don't have any details on them," explained the hooded man, "other then they are Hogwarts students, so you'd be taking care of them under the nose of Dumbledore.""Dumbledore eh?" said the voice thoughtfully, "I enjoy a challenge, but it may take a while since it will require extra planning.""Take all the time you need. Just get it done," with that the man turned on his heel and headed out of the room."Just one more thing," said the voice from the chair, causing the man to pause with his hand on the thick velvet curtain, "what exactly did these children do to you that you would send someone like me after them?""They stole something from me," replied the man without turning."It must have been pretty valuable.""It was priceless," said the man. The sleeve of the outstretch hand holding the curtain slipped back to reveal a black tattoo of a beetle on his forearm, "they stole my master's future.""We didn't take anything," complained Fred bitterly, helping himself to some scrambled egg."Oh and I suppose it just magically disappeared did it?" countered Percy throwing his hands up."Just because you've misplaced something it doesn't mean you should blame us," explained George picking some toast up and starting to butter it."It was on the cabinet in my room when I went to bed last night," said Percy through gritted teeth, "and this morning it's suddenly missing.""Honestly, what is going on?" complained Mrs Weasley stepping into the kitchen of the Burrow and dumping her arm full of potatoes into the sink, "I can hear you three outside.""Fred and George stole my prefect's badge," Percy informed his mother."Fred? George?" sighed Mrs Weasley, "did you take his badge?""Mum, does that really sound like something we'd do?" asked George innocently."Well let's see shall we," said Mrs Weasley counting on her fingers, "when Bill got his prefect's badge you hid it in your father's packed lunch, and then with Charlie if I recall you pinned his badge on one of the gnomes in the garden. So yes, it does sound like something you'd do.""You really didn't think through that argument did you?" Fred asked his twin."Well?" asked Mrs Weasley tapping her foot, "where is it?""I can honestly say I don't know," said George, the picture of purity."Fine," said Mrs Weasley taking her wand out from the pocket on the front of her apron, "accio prefect's badge!"Percy suddenly went from looking decidedly smug to a mixture of panic and surprise as he suddenly jumped up out of his seat. There was a loud ripping sound and a shining piece of metal flew through the air which was caught by Mrs Weasley. She frowned as she looked at the badge, which had some white fabric attached to it. She looked from the badge, to the giggling twins, and finally to Percy who frantically had his hand clamped over the seat of his trousers."You attached it to his pants?" asked George laughing."Well you said put it in the last place he would look," replied Fred grinning."Percy take this, then upstairs and get changed out of those clothes," ordered Mrs Weasley, handing the badge back to him. The new Hogwarts prefect gave a dark look towards his brothers as he disappeared up the stairs. She turned to the twins, "well at least I now have volunteers for peeling the potatoes.""Mum," complained Fred looking at the pile currently in the sink."Don't complain," Mrs Weasley said cutting him off, "or I'll leave you two here when we go to Diagon Alley to collect yours and your brothers' school things.""So we'll have the place to ourselves?" asked George raising an eyebrow."Hmm," Mrs Weasley pictured the house if she'd left the twins unattended, "on second thoughts you'll be coming with me no matter what.""So this means we can complain about having to peel the potatoes?" Fred clarified."Of course," replied Mrs Weasley, "if you want to end up peeling all of the vegetables for every dinner until you go back to school."Charlie had left home the week before, midst floods of tears from Mrs Weasley, to start his new job in a dragon sanctuary in Romania. This coupled with the fact that Bill had moved out a couple of years previous meant that the Burrow had become less crowded than normal. The downside of this was that it meant there was one less person for the twins to mess around with and Charlie's household chores were divided amongst the rest of the children, although on the plus side it meant larger portions at meal times.Normally the twins would spend their summer holidays trying to think up new ways to annoy Percy, or some ridiculous scheme that would usual end up with one or both of them nursing a new bruise or cut, but with their youngest brother Ron finally starting at Hogwarts their new past time was to wind him up over what to expect about when he finally started school."Don't get me started on Defence Against the Dark Arts," said George shaking his head."Why what's wrong with that one?" asked Ron, not really wanting to hear the answer."Well basically all that happens is the teacher just shows you all the different hexes and curses by trying them out on you," explained Fred seriously, "and some of those can be quite painful.""But they can't do that can they?""You try telling them that," replied George, "last time we complained we were hung up by our thumbs.""And then we complained about that," admitted Fred, "so instead they hung us by our ankles.""Stop talking nonsense," Mrs Weasley said having overheard them, "don't you listen to a word they say, Hogwarts is a wonderful place. You two, make a start on peeling those potatoes will you?""Yeah, you two," said George looking at his two brothers, "get on with it.""Honestly," said Mrs Weasley ushering the twins towards the sink, "if you were that quick witted during your classes you'd be the next Minister of Magic.""Hey, we got good marks this year," complained Fred starting to get to work."Yes your marks were good," admitted Mrs Weasley, "but I was more concerned with the number of letters I received from Professor McGonagall during the year about your general behaviour and the less said about the school holiday in Egypt the better. I would wonder where you get it from but I think after last year we can firmly plant that question at the feet of your uncle.""Evening Weasleys," bellowed Mr Weasley pushing open the door to the Burrow, Errol the family's owl flew in over his shoulder and landed awkwardly on the table."Alright dad," nodded Fred before turning back to peeling the potatoes."A nice collection of letters today," said Mr Weasley, kissing his wife on the cheek and flicking through the post he'd collected off the owl, "there are a couple here for you boys.""Really?" asked George turning around and looking eagerly at a package on the table."No, that's mine," said Mr Weasley handing two letters over to him, "these ones are yours.""You can read those," said Mrs Weasley plucking them out of George's hand, "when you are done with the peeling.""What's in the package?" asked Fred pointing at the small box on the table."Oh this?" beamed Mr Weasley picking up the package, "it's something special I picked up for your mum.""For me?" smiled a surprised Mrs Weasley."I know our anniversary isn't for a while yet but I've been after this for ages. You can open it now."Mrs Weasley hummed a little happy tune to herself as the pulled the brown paper apart, opened the box and retrieved the contents."Oh… it's lovely," said Mrs Weasley slowly, holding her present up for all to see, "what is it?""It's a torch," said Mr Weasley triumphantly rummaging around under the skin, until he pulled out a box full of batteries of every size, "watch this."Mr Weasley took the torch from his wife and unscrewed the top. He fumbled through the box of batteries until he found two that would fit inside. Replacing the top he, flicked the button so that a beam of light shot from the end. He was so excited by the whole thing he almost dropped it."That's nice," commented Mrs Weasley carefully."That's what I thought," said Mr Weasley pulling the beam of light around the room with a look of childish glee on his face, "now if we get up in the night and we need to look for something in the dark we'll be able to see.""Can't we just use our wands for that?" Mrs Weasley pointed out diplomatically."Ah, but what if you are looking for your wand?" countered Mr Weasley, shining the torch up the chimney, "I'm going to try this out somewhere dark; just popping to the shed."Mr Weasley bounced out of the door, before quickly sticking his head back in, "you don't mind if I borrow your present for a bit do you dear?""No, absolutely not," smiled Mrs Weasley sweetly through clenched teeth. Once her husband's head disappeared from view she let out a long sigh and rolled her eyes."I don't know why we have to do this," complained Fred hacking away at a large potato, "you could easily do this in a second with a spell.""Yes," agreed Mrs Weasley, "and if you'd left Percy alone I would have used magic to peel the potatoes, but seeing as you just had to torment him…""Actually when you put it that way…" admitted Fred shrugging."…it seems worth it," finished George.They eventually finished peeling the potatoes, although this would have been done much sooner if they hadn't kept taking breaks from their work to flick the peelings at each other, much to the chagrin of Mrs Weasley who, tired of breaking up the skirmishes, took to knitting at the kitchen table to keep an eye on the pair.As the warm and fragrant smell of dinner began to envelope the house, the twins retired to their bedroom to read their two letters, one from their best friend Lee Jordan while the other was from their uncle, and former teacher, Enoch."How's Lee getting on?" asked Fred who was busy reading their uncle's letter."He's doing fine," replied George lying on the floor with his legs propped up against the wall, "stayed the summer with his cousins. What about Enoch?""He's heading to South America," Fred informed his brother, "he heard about some buried treasure in a remote part of the Amazon, apparently he would have invited us along but since he couldn't guarantee the safety of the rainforest he decided against it.""Cheeky git," muttered George, not looking up from Lee's letter, "it's been months since we've broken anything.""The table in the Gryffindor Common Room," reminded Fred."It's been weeks since we've broken anything," said George not missing a beat."There was that window at the Egyptian school.""It's been days…""Percy's cauldron," Fred interrupted."It's been hours," George said slowly looking at his brother, who nodded in agreement, before finishing his sentence, "since we've broken anything.""Fred! George!" Mrs Weasley shouted up the stairs, "which one of you did this?""It's been minutes…"

Diagon Alley was buzzing with the sound of people talking, animals squawking and shopkeepers trying to entice customers into their stores. Mrs Weasley was trying her best to coral the family around the various different outlets without losing any of them, having to pay particular attention to the twins who had a habit of getting distracted by something in a window and remaining there without telling her.As the twins' youngest brother Ron was starting at Hogwarts this year, the majority of the items they were in London for were for him. Mrs Weasley had taken Ron into Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions along with the youngest and only female amongst the Weasley children Ginny, to arrange to have him fitted for his school robes. As the Weasley family didn't really have much money to spare, rather then getting new robes, Ron was getting hand-me-downs from one of his older brothers and Madam Malkin was making the necessary adjustments to them. Since this would take a while Percy had been left in charge of the twins, under strict instructions to try and keep them out of trouble. He'd managed it for about twenty seconds which, in fairness to Percy, was twenty seconds longer than the twins had expected it."How would you like me to punch your lights out?" asked Marcus Flint, the Slytherin Quidditch Captain, sixth year and all round knuckle dragging bully. A few seconds previously Fred had accidentally bumped into him, thus starting the initial altercation, although the twins were doing there part to fan the flames of confrontation."Are you expecting me to answer that?" replied Fred frowning, "because I think I'll have to go with no.""Are you sure there Fred?" asked George, "there is a lot to be said for a good old punch in the face.""I'm sure there is," admitted Fred shrugging, "but I'm not really in the mood today. Maybe next time though.""You two think you are so smart don't you?" growled Flint glowering at the pair."Who us?" asked George pointing a thumb at his own chest, and shaking his head, "we don't think we are smarter than the average student at Hogwarts.""Although compared to you we are geniuses," admitted Fred smiling."Anyone compared to him would be a genius," argued George pointing at himself, "me, you, Percy, a brick, we could all outsmart him.""Right that's it," snapped Flint grabbing hold of George's shirt and pulling his fist back."Stop that right now," ordered Percy marching forward and forcing himself between the pair. Flint in his surprise let go of George. Percy pulled aside his coat to reveal his prefect's badge pinned to his shirt. It had been polished that much that it simply gleamed in the sunlight. "I'm a prefect now so you have to do what I say.""No I don't," Flint disagreed shaking his head."Yes, you do," countered Percy holding firm."Why?" asked Flint."Because…" Percy started, before realising he couldn't actually come up with a reasonable argument, "because I'm a prefect, that's why.""We're not in school," said Flint, motioning with his hands at the area around them to emphasise the point, "and you know what? Even if we were, I still wouldn't listen to you.""Well if we were in school, I'd have put you in detention by now.""And I'd have put you in the Hospital Wing by now," muttered Flint, "in fact; there is nothing from stopping me doing that now.""Now see here…" Percy started as Flint grabbed hold of his shirt and pulled his fist back.Flint's look of glee changed to one of surprise and finally annoyance as his cocked fist was grabbed from behind and wrenched up behind his back. Flint struggled as hard as he could but his assailant had him held tight."Still not picking on people your own size I see Flint," said Miro Franca, the best friend of the twins' brother Charlie, holding onto the struggling Slytherin student."You're about my size," replied Flint still trying to break free, "why don't you let me go and we can settle this properly?""Fair enough," shrugged Miro, pushing Flint away from him."Big mistake," muttered Flint, rubbing his now sore arm before raising both fists."That's exactly what I was thinking," admitted Miro pulling out his wand."Hey, that's not fair, you can't use magic," complained Flint suddenly unsure of what to do."Actually," smiled Miro twirling his wand in a circle, "I turned seventeen just after Christmas so yes, I'm allowed to use magic.""So you'll use a wand against someone who is unarmed?" sneered Flint."Where you are concerned, I'll take any advantage I can get," replied Miro coolly, "it's the first thing you learn at Auror training.""Really?" asked Fred completely ignoring the tension of the confrontation."Actually no," admitted Miro shaking his head, "the first thing they teach you is where the toilets and kitchen are, then they'll introduce in the instructors, go over the course aims, basic skills that kind of thing. I'd say it's probably about the eighteenth thing you learn…""Oi," snapped Flint, annoyed at Miro's distracted conversation, "are you forgetting I'm here?""Sadly no," admitted Miro, "I doubt anyone with even the weakest sense of smell would be able to forget about you.""Why you…""Marcus Reginald Flint where are you?" barked a shrill voice, causing a startled Flint to spin around with a panicked look on his face."Mum," replied Flint looking annoyed."Don't you 'mum' me," snapped the woman as she walked over to Flint and the Gryffinor boys from one of the many nearby shops. She was dressed in a dark pink outfit with her hair pulled up in a tight bun. She looked at her son and then at the other boys over her horned rimmed glasses. "Well Marcus? Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?""They aren't my friends," mumbled Flint rolling his eyes."Honestly what have I said about you speaking up? How is anyone suppose to be able to hear you properly when you mumble like that?" asked Mrs Flint, her voice quick and sharp, "now what did you say?""They aren't my friends," Flint reiterated this time making sure he pronounced the words clearly."Nonsense," replied Mrs Flint dismissively, "of course you are friends, you're the same age aren't you?" She stopped addressing her son and turned to the twins, Percy and Miro, and broke out in a wide smile and addressed them in a much friendlier tone, "Serendipity Flint, although my friends call me Bunty, not entirely sure why, but I'm very please to finally meet some of Marcus's friends, never talks about any of you of course. I'm hard pressed to even get a 'hello' out of him most days.""Really?" asked Miro smiling as he shook Mrs Flint's offered hand, "that is a surprise because at school he is always talking about you.""He is?" beamed a surprised Mrs Flint looking thoroughly pleased, "well he always was a bit of a mummy's boy, weren't you?" she looked over at her son and ruffled his hair, "don't slouch dear, you weren't raised by goblins." She turned back to Miro, "I'm sorry I didn't catch your name.""Miro Franca.""Miro… Miro…," Mrs Flint said to herself thoughtfully, "no relation to Mercia Franca are you?""That's my aunt," admitted Miro nodding."Ah yes I know her well," Mrs Flint smiled, "she's always talking about you, said you were training to be an Auror, is that right?""Yes that's right, I left Hogwarts just last year.""Well bully for you, that's a fantastic career choice," Mrs Flint congratulated him with a friendly punch on the shoulder before pointing a thumb over her shoulder at her son, "I don't suppose you could have a word with him could you? Appalling results last year, I'm surprised they let him back in.""Mum!" complained Flint, as the twins sniggered."In a minute dear," replied Mrs Flint dismissively, "of course I doubt he'd survive long as an Auror. They have nerves of steal and that silly thing was afraid of the dark until he was about twelve, almost missed catching his first Hogwarts Express because he couldn't leave home without his little teddy-bear…""Mum!""Oh that's right; it wasn't a teddy-bear was it? It was a toy rabbit; Flopsy I seem to recall," she corrected herself misunderstanding her son's complaint. She turned to look at Percy and the twins, her eyes flickering over their red hair, "don't tell me, you'll have to be some of Molly Weasley's lot aren't you?""That's right," said Percy stepping forward, he shook Mrs Flint's hand and gave a brief pompous bow, "I'm Percy and they are Fred and George.""Very nice to meet you," she said shaking the twins' hands as well. She looked at Percy and noticed his prefect's badge poking out from behind his coat, "my word, a prefect are you? Very impressive, I had hoped Marcus would have followed in my footsteps and been made one but there's a little too much of his father in him I think. How is your dear mother these days? I use to go to school with her, different Houses of course but we always got on well.""She's actually over in Madam Malkin's at the moment," explained Percy pointing towards the shop, "our younger brother is starting this year so she's just getting his robes adjusted.""Excellent," smiled Mrs Flint looking at the shop, "I think I'll go and catch up with her." She turned to look at her son, "you should come too, I can't carry all these bags on my own, plus we can pick you up some new underwear while we are there." She rolled her eyes up at Miro, "honestly don't know how he manages to go through them so quickly when he's at school. Very nice to meet you boys, come along Marcus.""See you Marcus," Miro waved bye."Bye Marcus," chorused the twins "say 'hello' to Flopsy for us." Flint shot them a look of pure hatred as he passed by.Mrs Flint pushed open the door to Madam Malkin's and stepped inside along with her son, before it swung shut they just about managed to hear her exclaim in her high-pitched voice, "Molly, my dear how are you?""That was just about perfect," George stated firmly with a smile on his face."Just about?" asked Fred frowning, "what were we missing?""Ice-cream," replied George, "there is always room for ice-cream to make things even better.""Come on then," sighed Miro pointing towards Florean Forescue's Ice Cream Parlour where there was a line of children waiting to buy some delicious ice-cream, "my treat.""Nice one Miro," said Fred slapping their ex-team-mate on the back."Well I'm getting paid now," shrugged Miro, "but don't get anything too fancy, I'm not made of money you know."The four boys sat down at one of the tables outside of the shop while they tried to work out which delectable flavour to try. Eventually they settled on a choice and Miro headed up to order it."How's Charlie getting on in Romania?" asked Miro when he returned to his seat."He's loving it," admitted Percy, "sent a letter home last week, the edges were a bit singed, but he said he was having a blast.""I'm not surprised," smiled Miro, "that boy was obsessed with dragons. You should have seen all the posters he put up in our dormitory, it was like living in a reptile house. So you made prefect then Percy?""Oh God," said Fred slapping a hand to his forehead, "don't get him started.""Yes I did," said Percy, flashing a look of annoyance at his brother, "although to be honest it was hardly surprising.""I'll say," agreed Miro, "you certainly do epitomise everything that it means to be a prefect.""That's a bit mean to the prefects isn't it?" asked George."So what's it like training to be an Auror?" asked Percy quickly, choosing to ignore his brother."It's great;" smiled Miro, "but it is hard work, and I don't just mean having to learn all the different skills you need. They are constantly testing you.""What you mean like exams and stuff?" enquired George looking unimpressed, "I thought you'd have had enough of that at school.""No, although there are plenty of theory and practical exams," agreed Miro, "I mean they keep doing weird tests to see if you are ready to be Auror material. I have one instructor who keeps jumping out from nowhere and attacking me to see if I'm prepared to defend myself.""That seems a little extreme," remarked Percy looking rather shocked."That seems brilliant," exclaimed Fred."That's what I thought at first," admitted Miro nodding in agreement, "but when you suddenly get attacked in the middle of the night by a man who has been hiding under your bed for the last four hours before jumping out at you, it tends to get a little annoying.""Yeah, actually that doesn't sound the best," George concurred.Soon the waitress brought over their orders and they were just pushing back their bowls as Mrs Weasley, spotting them from across the road, met up with them, with Ron and Ginny in tow."Mummy," said Ginny pulling on her mother's sleeve, "can I have an ice-cream?""Yeah me too," added Ron looking longingly at the counter where all the various flavours were displayed and licking his lips."Ah okay why not? Here," Mrs Weasley fished out a few coins from her purse and handed them to Ron, "thanks ever so much for keeping an eye on them Miro.""They were no trouble," Miro responded despite Percy flashing a look at the twins."Mum," said Percy, "can I go to Flourish and Blotts? I want to see if they have any books on being a prefect.""Of course dear," Mrs Weasley replied, "we'll meet you over there when Ron and Ginny have finished their ice-creams.""How come he gets to go off on his own?" complained Fred."Because I can be trusted," replied Percy before heading off down the street."We can be trusted," sulked George, looking at his mother."If you want Mrs Weasley," said Miro, "I can keep an eye on them; let you get on with shopping for their school stuff.""Oh Miro, you really are a Godsend," Mrs Weasley slumped down into the chair recently vacated by Percy, "you'd think I'd have got use to shopping for stuff for school by now. Are you sure you don't mind?""Of course not, I've got the morning off," shrugged Miro, "I'll take them down to Quality Quidditch Supplies that'll keep them busy for a while.""Excellent," smiled Fred suddenly jumping up, "come on lets go.""No Knockturn Alley," Mrs Weasley ordered as George and Miro joined Fred."Mum," complained George, pointing at Miro, "we're going with an Auror, how much safer could we be?""No." She stated firmly."Understood Mrs Weasley," said Miro giving her a thumbs-up, "see you later."Miro and the twins turned and left the others at the table and headed down the street. Diagon Alley was full of students from Hogwarts, their families also having decided to shop there for school supplies. They bumped into a number of Gryffindor students along the way as well the school's groundkeeper Hagrid, who was carrying a beautiful white snowy owl in a cage through the crowd.Despite their best attempts to persuade Miro to lead them through the infamous Knockturn Alley rather then the Quidditch shop, he bluntly refused based on his promise to their mother. However he did eventually, after much beseeching from both of the Weasley boys to show them something interesting, agreed to take them to a shop hidden away through the back alleys and laneways that branched off from the main street.This particular shop was a museum of Dark Arts; it charted the history of black magic along with some details of some of the most dangerous wizards that the world had ever seen. Statues and portraits showed the depiction of the various effects of perilous and, in most cases, illegal curses that could be performed."Pfft, he weren't so tough," said George as they walked out of an exhibit devoted to Shadeesh Kai."This from the man who is scared of bats," muttered Fred rolling his eyes."I'm not scared of them," countered George, "I'm just saying we should keep our eye on them, I don't trust them.""Are you two ever serious?" asked Miro shaking his head."I tried it once a few years ago," admitted Fred shuddering, "decided it just wasn't for me."The three boys wandered through the different rooms, occasionally calling each other over to a particular portrait that showed some disgustingly deformed victim. Eventually they managed to wander through each of the rooms, and had a quick stop in the gift shop before leaving. Miro decided to buy each of the twins a key ring with a small shrunken head attached to it, whose eyes swivelled back and forth when you swung it. They stepped back out into the street, not before George had informed the short squat women behind the counter of the gift shop that their statue of Shadeesh Kai looked nothing like him, and headed back towards the main part of Diagon Alley."Cheers for this Miro," said Fred holding up his key ring, "he actually looks a bit like Percy.""That's a bit unfair," said George taking a closer look, "he's nowhere near as ugly as Percy.""Of course there is one slight problem with it," Fred said apologetically as the three boys walked into a small empty courtyard."Oh yeah?" said Miro absentmindedly looking around the quad with a frown on his face, "what's that?""The thing is I don't actually own any keys.""Well you are going to own some keys at some point aren't you?" Miro was now looking at the rooftops of the buildings surrounding the square."I suppose," thought Fred much happier. They'd almost reached the far side of the courtyard and were about to enter another alleyway, "is everything okay?""Yeah," said Miro shaking his head, "I just thought… you know what? It doesn't matter, probably nothing anyway. It's all this Auror training. It's starting to make me paranoid.""Don't worry Miro," said George slapping him on the back, "you've got me and Fred here to protect you."There was a slight scraping sound from above them. A couple of roof tiles came loose and smashed onto the ground below. Then the attack started.





--------




"Watch out," ordered Miro pushing the twins to one side, as a bolt of magic missed them and smashed loudly into the pavement throwing up shrapnel of stone.Fred and George landed heavily on the ground rolling slightly andboth reached for their wands, but before they could draw them a second spell struck the pair of them. A strange feeling of coldness swarmed through their bodies suddenly making it impossible for them to move. They both crumpled over onto the ground. Both rigid as boards all they could do was watch helplessly from the floor as Miro confronted the attacker.Miro dived to one side pulling his wand out of his inside pocket; he rolled awkwardly on the floor and managed to cast a shield charm just in time to protect himself. A blue blast of magic ricocheted off the supernatural shield and crashed into one of the buildings where it evaporated and left a small blue stain.Miro raised his wand as he got to his feet. His assailant was dressed in a dark heavy cloak, a cowl pulled tight over his head, while he pointed his own wand at the young Auror. The pair slowly circled each other, Miro making sure to move himself between the attacker and the twins. He waved his wand and chanted "Stupefy!"His opponent, expecting a Stunning Spell dodged to one side but was surprised to find himself being hit from behind by several small tiles from the roof of the building behind him instead. The slabs caused him to stumble slightly, and fall down onto one knee. Miro used this momentary confusion to send a real Stunning Spell at him.The man's reactions were quicker than Miro had expected. He flicked his wand, muttered an unheard incantation and a section of the ground rose up to protect him. The red beam of the Stunning Spell slammed into and destroyed it in a cloud of dust. He quickly followed up with an attack of his own.Using his wand to raise the tiles that had struck him high over his head, he flicked his wand so that they were transformed into arrows. He then waved in the direction of Miro. The darts flew at towards the young trainee Auror, bearing down on him, hoping to strike home.Miro, with sweat glistening on his brow, gestured his wand at the oncoming missiles and as the wave of light blue magic enveloped them they were turned into flowers which harmlessly fell to the ground and crumpled onto the floor. He quickly fired off another spell but this missed its mark completely, leaving an unsightly green blob stuck to the side of one of the surrounding buildings.The two combatants circled each other once again. Miro was breathing heavily from the exertion and concentration required for the fight. His opponent however didn't seem to be affected by their battle, although from within the confines of the cloak it was difficult to tell anything about the man.Miro kept his wand aimed at his opponent, while he tried to work out a possible strategy. Unfortunately he wasn't given much time as the man again attacked. Miro's reaction was purely instinctual as he returned fire with his own spell; a beam of electric charge erupted from the end of his wand and arched its way across the square.The beam connected with the cloaked man's spell which was travelling in the other direction. They met in a ball of extreme magic. Like Miro's, the man's spell was still connected to his wand by a long ray of magic.Droplets of sweat formed on Miro's head and he tried to force his spell through to its target. He held on hard to his wand with both hands and concentrated on pushing the magic the other way. Beyond the strobing ball of light he could see his opponent doing the same but with much more success.Realising he was facing a losing battle, which would ultimately drain him of a lot of energy to maintain, Miro did the only thing he could think of. He cancelled his spell with a flick of his wrist and dived down onto the floor as the magic shot over his head and into one of the buildings.From the ground he quickly used a Summoning Spell on the paving slab below one of the man's feet. It wrenched free of the ground,making the man fall backwards and land heavily on his back. Any advantage Miro had made for himself was quickly lost as he had to dodge out of the way of the quickly approaching stone. By the time he'd aimed his wand at his opponent he could see him already struggling back to his feet.The cloaked man fired another salvo at him, but Miro dodged to one side and returned fire. However rather than trying to attack directly this time he aimed just in front of the man. The spell shattered the pavement in front of him, sending up shards of broken stone. The man had to pull his arm up in front of his face to protect himself. Miro used this distraction to send a Disarming Spell at him.The spell struck home and the man's wand flew out of his hand and bounced along the ground. Miro paused in his attacks, expecting the man to surrender. However the man reached into his cloak, pulled out a small vial of liquid and threw it high into the air at Miro."Expulso," chanted Miro aiming at the vial as it spiralled through the air. The magic struck home, shattering the vial in an explosion, causing the liquid inside to rain down onto him.As the droplets of the purple liquid struck his body Miro could feel surges of coldness flood under his skin. He raised his wand to fire off another spell but found that his arm, which was covered in the liquid, remained useless at his side. He could feel the coolness spread over his legs suddenly causing them to go numb and buckle underneath him.He could do nothing as he lay crumpled on the floor of the square. The twins too, watched helplessly from the sidelines as the cloaked man stooped to pick up his wand before slowly walking towards their friend.The man stood over Miro looking down at him from within his cowl. He reached up his two hands and held onto the side of the hood and pushed it back."Not bad Mr Franca," beamed the man, who had a round friendly face, flushed red from all the exertions of the battle. He waived his wand over the boy, counteracting the effects of the potion, "a thoroughly good confrontation.""Mr Lexington," groaned Miro straightening his body as he gradually regained control of it, "you do know I have the morning off right?""Oh I'm sorry," apologised Lexington sarcastically, "I didn't realise that dark wizards only attack after lunch. What do I keep telling you my old mentor use to say?""Constant vigilance," muttered Miro mantra like."Constant vigilance," reiterated Mr Lexington, "when you get complacent that's when you get killed.""Er… Mr Lexington? I don't suppose…" Miro pointed over at Fred and George who were still under the effects of the freezing charm."Oh yes, sorry," said Lexington waving his wand in their direction. They both let out extended groans as life started coursing through their bodies once again, "had to immobilise them first, didn't want them getting hurt.""Lucky them," said Miro massaging his shoulder as he stood up, he looked at the twins, "this is Mr Lexington, one of my Auror instructors. Mr Lexington these are my friends Fred and George Weasley.""Nice to meet you boys," smiled Lexington nodding at the twins. He turned back to look at Miro, "you had some good moves there. I especially liked the fake Stunning Spell; I'm assuming you cast a nonverbal spell at the same time, that's not easy. Although you did let your guard down at the end, just because someone loses their wand it doesn't make them any less dangerous.""Yeah I noticed," said Miro looking at the remains of the vial scattered on the ground, "a paralyzing potion?""Yep," agreed Lexington nodding, "I thought you'd probably try and blast it in the air. Far too aggressive.""Why would you even carry it?""I always carry a back up of potions," admitted Lexington, he pull aside his cloak to reveal a number of vials of different colours secured to his belt, "I also have a back up wand strapped to my ankle, and a few other magical objects in my pockets. Preparation is the key my lad.""I'll remember that," said Miro shaking his head."Good lad," said Lexington slapping him on the back, "well I'm off for the afternoon so I guess I won't see you again until Monday, have a good weekend, enjoy your cousin's wedding.""Thanks," said Miro. He suddenly frowned, "how did you know I'm going to my cousin's wedding?""I think one of the other students mentioned it," replied Lexington casually."Please don't attack me at the wedding," implored Miro."Did I say I was going to?""No," admitted Miro putting his hands on his hips, "but that is precisely the kind of thing you would do. Remember Callaghan's leaving party the other week?""What about it?""You leapt out of the cake and started cursing everyone.""Oh and I suppose a dark wizard is going to leave you alone because you are wearing a little party hat is he?""Just please don't attack me during the wedding," pleaded Miro."Fine, I won't," conceded Lexington after a moments pause, "well I better be off then, see you around, and nice to meet you two.""See you later," Miro nodded at his instructor. Lexington spun on the spot and disappeared with a loud cracking sound. Just as he did Miro shouted at him, "wait! Don't attack me at the reception either! Damn it, I hope he heard that.""Seems like a nice guy," said Fred as the three of them looked at the empty space recently vacated by Lexington."Oh he's great," admitted Miro, "just completely and utterly nuts.""We should probably check with dad to see if he is a relation," said George thoughtfully.Miro and the twins returned to the bustling main part of Diagon Alley, they managed to locate the rest of the Weasley clan still in Flourish and Blotts. Mrs Weasley had spotted an old friend and they were busy chattering away while the children were busying themselves by reading some of the books; Ron had picked up a copy of a Quidditch book about Chudley Cannons, Ginny was excitedly reading the latest Gilderoy Lockhart book and Percy was busy devouring a book he'd found entitled 'Prefect to Minister – The Biography of Cornelius Fudge.'"Who's mum talking to?" Fred nudged Ron with his foot."I dunno," replied Ron not looking up, "some woman…""Your powers of observation sometimes astound me Ronald," George said rolling his eyes, "we can see she is talking to 'some woman' what Fred meant was what her name is?""Burns, Bones or something like that," muttered Ron frowning, "her daughter is starting at Hogwarts this year. Can you believe this? It says Chudleys are generally accepted as being the worse team in the league.""That's blatantly untrue," admitted Fred thoughtfully rubbing his chin, "it's completely accepted.""Sorry Ron, it's true," agreed Miro sympathetically, "the Chudleys are the worst team ever but they do have the most loyal fans.""That's true," nodded Ron looking proud, "we are the best.""I just meant that if any other team played like that week in week out their fans would be up in arms," Miro clarified, "but you Chudsters seem to just accept it.""Our time is coming," said Ron indignantly, "you'll see. This year you'll see some great Quidditch being played at Chudleigh Stadium.""Yeah, you aren't wrong there," agreed George, "but it'll be played by their opposition.""Okay guys," said Miro before an argument could flair up, "I'm gonna be off, say bye to your mother for me. Ron, good luck at Hogwarts.""See you Miro," chorused the twins."Good luck?" Ron's face crinkled up into a frown, "why would he wish me good luck?""Well you know," said Fred lowering his voice, "the whole sorting ceremony.""What about it?" asked Ron wide eyed with panic, "Percy said they just put a hat on you and it decides for you.""A hat that decides what House you are going in?" George raised an eyebrow sceptically, "does that honestly sound like something that would happen?""I thought it was a bit weird," admitted Ron closing the book, "so what happens?""We're not supposed to tell you," said George whispering and looking around in case anyone was listening in, "it's a big Hogwarts secret.""I won't tell anyone," replied Ron leaning close, the level of his voice matching that of his brother, "what do you have to do?""You have to go through a test," said Fred solemnly, looking over his shoulder theatrically, "it's supposed to be different for everyone but they are basically the same few things.""Like what?" asked Ron panicking, "I haven't done any magic yet, how am I supposed to face a test?""Well they only let the very best into Hogwarts," reasoned George, "you know they have to make sure there aren't any Squibs.""But what if you fail the test?" asked Ron horrified at the prospect."Then you get sent home on the same day," shrugged Fred, "you get marched straight back onto the Hogwarts' Express and its goodbye forever.""They kill you?" asked Ron, his voice becoming shrill."No, you idiot," said George rolling his eyes, "I mean, you just won't be allowed back to Hogwarts ever again.""Oh," Ron nodded thoughtfully, "did they send anyone home when you started?""Oh yes," said Fred trying to look sympathetic, "there was this one girl, they asked her to walk through fire without getting burned but she couldn't do it. Tried three times and got really badly burnt, but she really wanted to join the school so she kept trying and trying. In the end they had to practically drag her away to stop her from hurting herself to bad.""Really?""Yeah," agreed George shaking his head solemnly, "it was quite sad in the end, she kept asking for one more try and was crying her little heart out bless her.""That's awful," gasped Ron with a look of terror on his face."Shh," ordered George pressing a finger against his mouth, "keep it down will you? If any one finds out we told you we could get expelled.""Okay okay, sorry," said Ron lowering his voice again, "but what if that happens to me? I don't know how to walk through fire.""You don't?" asked Fred frowning."Of course not," snapped Ron his voice getting higher again, "when would I ever have had a chance to find that out?""With us around?" George said thoughtfully. "Probably quite a few times.""Okay that's actually fair enough," conceded Ron, "but what happens if I'm asked to do it.""Relax," soothed Fred, "you probably won't be asked to do that.""Yeah," agreed George, "normally it's something like turn a tree into stone, or make yourself disappear or wrestle a Water-Salamanda to the ground.""I can't do any of those things," said Ron rather loudly, causing Percy to look up from his reading before frowning and carrying on."Don't worry," said Fred, "neither could we before we started but luckily for us Charlie and Bill decided to teach us a few things before school started. We'll do the same for you.""You will?" said Ron looking relieved "thanks a bunch guys.""Hey, what are big brothers for?"The Weasley family eventually left Flourish and Blotts and continued to pick up the various items they each needed for school, soon Mrs Weasley announced that is was time to head back home."But we didn't get my wand," complained Ron looking at Ollivander's shop as they passed by."Sorry dear," said Mrs Weasley kindly, "we just can't afford to get you a new wand, you're getting Charlie's old one.""That thing?" asked Ron extremely disappointed, "there's a chip in it and the Unicorn hair is falling out of the end.""I know," replied Mrs Weasley, "but we just can't replace it at the moment, and it always worked fine for Charlie. Maybe in a few years.""Fine," muttered Ron looking through the window of the shop with envy, "my robes are hand-me-downs, most of my books are hand-me-down, might as well have a hand-me-down wand too.""It could be worse," said Fred placing a hand on his brother's shoulder, "at least you don't have hand-me-down underwear.""Actually," Ron sighed, reached inside the waistband of his trousers and pulled up his underwear so show a very neatly place label with the name 'Percy' emblazoned on it.

"Do I really need to do this?" asked Ron wobbling on a long thin plank of wood that the twins had placed between two tree stumps."You have to learn balance," Fred pointed out helpfully."Fair enough but what about the blindfold?" said Ron pointing up at the cloth wrapped securely over his eyes."Because this is all about intuition isn't it?" replied George as a way of explanation, "you're hardly acting intuitively if you can see are you?""That depends," shrugged Ron, "what does 'intuitively' mean?""It means…" there was a pause as Fred tried best to explain it he looked over at George who just shrugged helpfully, "it means, acting without thinking.""Ah well I guess that means you two are the perfect choice to teach that to me," muttered Ron."Oi," complained George, "just be grateful we are only using apples.""Yeah," agreed Fred, picking one up from the basket they'd collected from one of the trees surrounding the Burrow and taking aim, "now try and dodge this."Fred through the fruit with deadly accuracy, it sailed through the air in a perfect arch and rebounded off of Ron's chest. He winced as the apple struck him, although more out of surprise then actual pain."I still don't know what throwing fruit at me is supposed to teach me," complained Ron rubbing his chest with his hand."What if during your Sorting ceremony they decide to hurl fireballs at you?" George said hands on hips, "are you just going to stand there and let them hit you?""No," retorted Ron sulkily, "but I'll at least be able to see them, so I'd have a chance of dodging them.""That's what you think," replied Fred casually, "when Charlie had his ceremony, they blindfolded him and got him to run across the hall dodging a couple of Bludgers.""Really?" asked Ron opened mouthed, "that's insane. They can't do that can they?""I know, but what are you doing to do? It's not as if you are going to turn around and say 'no' now is it?" said George picking up an apple, "now try and dodge this one."Ron waited patiently, trying to listen for the sound of the apple's flight. Suddenly he dodged to one side and flailed his arms as he tried to remain on the plank of wood, behind him he heard the apple landing in the soft grass."I did it," exclaimed Ron pushing the blindfold up with a wide grin on his face and looking at his brothers, "I thought I could see it coming towards me, and that's when I dodge out of the way.""Well done Ron," congratulated Fred, despite the fact that George had deliberately thrown the apple up high so that there was no chance of it striking their younger brother anyway, "I told you didn't I? Magic is all about instinct, oh sure you have to wave your wand about to do the spells and stuff but a lot of it is pure gut feeling.""Brilliant," beamed Ron still on a high after successfully 'dodging' the fruit, "to be honest I thought you two might have been winding me up at first.""Really?" Us?" said George looking astounded while Fred feigned a look of hurt, "we're your older brothers, it's our job to look out for you.""Yeah, I know," replied Ron looking a bit embarrassed to have thought so badly of the twins, "I do have one question though.""Fire away.""How do they decide what House you go into?" Ron brow creased as he frowned, "I get that the test is to make sure you aren't a Squib but how does that tell them where to put you.""Oh it's all about how you tackle the trial," explained Fred thinking fast, "so if you think of an intelligent way to beat something you'll be put in Ravenclaw, if you are cunning about it it'll be Slytherin.""So what did you two have to do?" asked Ron excitedly as he sat down on the plank of wood."Well it was pretty straight forward for me," George began. The twins had expected this question to crop up and had worked out their individual stories beforehand. "I was taken up onto the roof of one of the two story buildings on the grounds of the school and I was asked to get between it and other building without touching the ground.""That doesn't sound too bad," snorted Ron."That's what I thought," shrugged George, "until I saw the distance they expected me to jump, it was a good fifteen nearly twenty feet.""But that's too far," gasped Ron, "they couldn't expect you to have jumped that.""As I said it's all about how you approach the problem," explained George scratching behind his ear with one hand, "a couple of others were given the same problem, one of them just asked someone to give them a piggyback and walk back down the stairs and over to the other building, they ended up in Hufflepuff. Another person called a House Elf to use their magic to apparate them over, he's a Slytherin now.""So what did you do?""I just ran and jumped.""You did what?""Ran and jumped.""But that's stupid," scolded Ron rolling his eyes, "you couldn't have made it across. You didn't, did you?""No," admitted George, "I think I managed to leap about three quarters of the way across before I hit the ground.""You fell?" asked Ron, "and they still let you into Hogwarts?""Yes, you see while I did fall and land heavily, I didn't actually get hurt. In fact I bounced when I hit the ground so they knew I wasn't a Squib," stated George, "and because I had jumped even though I knew there was a very good chance I wouldn't make it, they said that was brave and put me in Gryffindor.""Well I guess I won't be in Gryffindor," muttered Ron, "because there is no way I would have tried to jump across like that. So what about you Fred?""Me?" said Fred stretching his arms up over his head and yawning, "oh nothing really, just had to battle a dragon.""A dragon?" both George and Ron exclaimed at once."Are you sure it was a dragon?" asked George looking pointedly at his twin who had blatantly come up with a completely different story to the one they had prepared, "are you sure it wasn't something like a family of wood pixies?""No, no, it was definitely a dragon," beamed Fred much to his twin's annoyance, "you don't get that close to a dragon and not remember it.""I can't believe they made you face a dragon," said a shocked Ron shaking his head."I know," agreed George slowly through clenched teeth, "it really is something only a complete idiot would think up, now something like I don't know, a family of wood pixies would be a far more sensible and believable suggestion.""So what did you have to do?" asked Ron excitedly."I had to clip off the end of one of its talons without waking it," said Fred trying to see nonchalant."Merlin's Beard," said Ron opened mouthed, "are you serious?""Completely," nodded Fred in agreement while George rolled his eyes, "I wasn't sure what to do so in the end I just walked straight up and did it, no sneaking around or anything. Just clip and done.""That is so brave," said Ron looking thoroughly impressed, he turned to look at Fred, "sounds like you got off lightly."Over the next few days, the twins set Ron a series of trials which gradually became more and more bizarre as they tried to see what they could pretty much get away with. Towards the end the twins had even started to run out of ideas of what they could get their younger brother to try and do. Although Fred's most ingenious plot was getting Ron to clear the gnomes out of the garden to test his speed and stamina (the fact that Mrs Weasley had asked the twins to clear them out earlier was something he'd forgotten to pass on).The days passed and it wasn't long before the twins, Percy and Ron were all packing their trunks for the start of the school year. Ron had inherited his older brother Charlie's trunk and found that the first thing he had to do was dump out all of his older brother's things that had been left to wallow at the bottom of it. Fred and George had a quick pick through the cast-offs to see if there was anything worth salvaging but since Charlie had already taken all the most useful stuff with him to Romania there was little for them to have.On the night before they were due to leave for Hogwarts the Weasley family sat down for their traditional farewell dinner. Mrs Weasley had put together a sumptuous feast containing all of their favourite foods which reminded the twins of the meal times at Hogwarts. The table was set, with Mrs Weasley, Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny all waiting expectantly around it. Casting a quick look up at the family clock showed that Mr Weasley was currently in the process of returning home, and sure enough a couple of seconds later a faint 'pop' could be heard outside."Evening Weasleys," said Mr Weasley opening the door wide and stepping into the kitchen. He was carrying a large cage with a grey cover over it."Where have you been?" asked Fred, as his stomach let out a loud rumble, "I'm starving, and what's that?""Ah well this is a special surprise," said Mr Weasley excitedly, rocking the cage slightly, "and I had to go and collect it from Diagon Alley. It's for Percy, for being made a prefect.""For me?" asked Percy looking equally surprised and delighted as his eyes fell onto the covered cage."Of course," fussed Mrs Weasley looking at his son with pride, "when Charlie and Bill became prefects we got them something each so it's only fair that you do too.""What about us?" asked George looking at the covered cage with envy."What about you?" countered Mrs Weasley, "if either of you become prefects then you'll get a present too.""Well there is always a chance…" said Fred hopefully as the cage was put down in the table in front of Percy."Go on then," said Mr Weasley beaming, gesticulating expectantly to Percy, "take the cover off."Percy leaned forward and grabbed the top of the cloth and pulled. His eyes opened wide. Perched proudly in the middle of the cage was a large owl with various different hues of brown feathers and a white underbelly."It's beautiful," gasped Percy leaning in close to look at his present, "what's it called?""That's for you to choose," said Mr Weasley, "it's a he by the way.""I'll call him Hermes," stated Percy firmly, he opened the front of the cage and put a hand inside. After looking at it warily for a few seconds the newly named Hermes allowed his owner to gently stroke his feathers, letting out a low appreciative hoot."With an owl like that, you might actually be cool this year," admitted Fred thoughtfully."Why Hermes?" asked Mrs Weasley as the family crowded around to admire the new addition to the family. The owl clearly enjoyed the attention and maintained an almost regal appearance."After Hermes Kanezza the first Head Boy of Hogwarts," beamed Percy still stroking Hermes' feathers."Okay, maybe you'll be cool next year," Fred altered his original assessment."How do you even know stuff like that?" George wondered out loud."It's in Hogwarts: a History," Percy replied haughtily, "not that I'd have expected you to know that of course since it would have involved reading a book, rather than using it to prop open your bedroom window.""If you can think of a better way to create a cool breeze in our room without using magic then feel free to let me know," George countered superbly."Enough," Mrs Weasley ordered calmly, she took the owl cage off of the table and carefully encouraged Hermes to jump out onto the kitchen counter. She shooed it towards the far end of the room where the family's owl, Errol, was quietly snoozing on a perch, "it's okay, go sit on the perch next to Errol."After a few moments realisation of what Mrs Weasley wanted dawned on Hermes, who hopped along the counter a couple of time before flapping his wings and landing gracefully on the perch. Unfortunately the noise of the younger owl flapping its wings woke Errol with such a start that he lost his balance, and, despite flapping desperately to right himself, ended up dropping backwards from the perch. However Errol momentarily forgot to loosen his grip from the piece of wood and suddenly found himself hanging up-side-down facing the wall, his wings flapping frantically while Hermes looked down at him from the perch."Thanks mum, thanks dad," gushed Percy giving both his parents a hug. He looked over at Ron, just as a faint thud from the corner of the room signalled that Errol's feet had finally decided to let go of the perch without first telling his wings to keep him airborne, "if you want you can have Scabbers.""Cheers," nodded Ron trying to sound enthusiastic. Although he thought it would be nice to have a pet, he couldn't help noting that this was another hand-me-down from one of his brothers."It's okay," Fred whispered to his younger brother, "George and I will teach you a spell to change Scabbers' colour, you'll have the only yellow rat at school.""Cool," commented Ron seeming happier."Okay everyone, sit back down," said Mrs Weasley sitting at one end of the table while her husband took his place at the head of it."Brilliant I'm starving," said Ron reaching for the nearest plate of food."Ah ah ah," scolded Mrs Weasley batting Ron's hand away from the food and pointedly picking up her drink, "I think a toast is in order.""Yes, quite so," agreed Mr Weasley reaching for his glass before standing up, "firstly, once again, congratulations to Percy for becoming the third Weasley in a row to be made a prefect.""Well done Percy," added Mrs Weasley as everyone took a sip of their drink."Wait a minute," said Fred dramatically with a look of shock on his face, "Percy has been made a prefect? This is the first I've heard about it. Why didn't you say something sooner?""Quick, I'll tell the Daily Prophet to hold the front page," added George."Very funny you two," reproached Mrs Weasley. She patted Percy on the arm, "ignore them, we're very proud of you. All of us are.""Yes we are," added Mr Weasley, still with his glass raised, "now where was I?""Oh God," groaned George under his breath, "not the 'first day of school speech' again is it?""Ron," said Mr Weasley turning to his youngest son, "tomorrow you will embark on a great adventure.""Merlin's Beard it is," muttered Fred rolling his eyes."Every generation of Weasley has attended Hogwarts…" Mr Weasley began to get up steam as he repeated the same speech he'd used previously for Bill, Charlie, Percy and the twins."I thought he might have forgotten about it this time," admitted George quietly as his father carried on."Yeah, but I think that was wishful thinking," agreed Fred. "I think the fact that we can all recite it by now should say something.""…a solid educational foundation is what you need to build your life on...""Here comes the bit that mum starts tearing up on," George pointed out, nodding towards Mrs Weasley, "here we go.""Without Hogwarts, I would never have met your dear mother…""She's gone," commented Fred softly as Mrs Weasley started dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief that had been tucked into her sleeve."Every time," said George shaking his head, "you'd think she'd have got used to it by now.""Oh, this is a new bit," admitted Fred as Mr Weasley began to talk about the children who had already attended or were currently attending the school."Bill has become a curse-breaker, Charlie is following his dream in Romania, Percy is now a prefect and Fred and George…" there was an awkward pause as Mr Weasley tried to work out what he could say that would be appropriate."Quidditch team," coughed Mrs Weasley helpfully."…are on the Quidditch team," carried on Mr Weasley without skipping a beat, "no doubt, you too Ron, will achieve great things in your time amongst those hallowed halls. To Ron.""To Ron," the rest of the family chorused toasting the boy."Very nice dear," commented Mrs Weasley as everyone began dishing food out onto their plates."Yeah good one dad," agreed Fred dishing out some mashed potato onto his plate, before drowning it in gravy, "you're getting better at them.""Only one more to go," said George picking up a chicken leg and waving it in the direction of Ginny before gnawing on it hungrily."Ew," muttered Ginny frowning and looking away as her brother chomped down on the meat."George, use your cutlery," scolded Mrs Weasley shaking her head and pointing at his knife and fork, "honestly I don't know where you get it from."The family looked along the table to where Mr Weasley had grasped a chicken leg in his hand and was in the middle of noisily taking a large bite out of it."Oh that's lovely," said Mr Weasley swallowing the mouthful off food, he suddenly became aware that the rest of his family were looking at him. His eyes flicked between each of his children and then finally settled on his wife, "sorry, did you say something dear?"

Despite all the warnings that Mrs Weasley had given the night before to her children to have everything ready for the journey to King's Cross, it still took the family a number of attempts to leave the House with everything in tow. They would have been late had it not been for Mr Weasley's creative driving skills at weaving through the traffic, although the twins did notice that he jabbed at a number of different buttons he'd recently installed in the dashboard which they suspected help him negotiate his way through the traffic."I'm afraid I won't be able to see you off this year," explained Mr Weasley as he slalomed between a number of cars, "have a big meeting in work so I'll literally just have to drop you off and go.""That's okay dad," replied Percy, casting a side long look at the twins, "I'll make sure everything runs smoothly.""It's not like we haven't done this before," muttered Fred lowly to his twin."We're nearly there," said Mr Weasley, pulling the car in a gap between two buses which initially seemed far too small to fit through but offered no problem as they passed by.Mr Weasley pulled the car into a spare loading bay outside of the station. The family piled out of the old blue Ford Anglia and quickly began unloading the boot of the car onto a number of trolleys, before waving the patriarch of the family off on his way as he returned to the driver's seat and started the car up again.Mrs Weasley, holding tightly onto Ginny's hand, led the way into the station as the family formed a procession of trolleys behind her. Hermes, in a cage on top of Percy's trunk, squawked agitatedly as they entered the crowded building."One time," commented Mrs Weasley, as they made their way down one of the platforms, passed dark haired boy whose trolley as packed with luggage as their's were, "I would just like to get here with plenty of time to spare. Honestly we'll miss the train one of these days. It's always so crowded, packed with muggles of course, still can't complain I suppose."Mrs Weasley paused and looked up at the plastic numbered boards above their heads, "now what's the platform number?""Nine and three-quarters!" piped Ginny, she squeezed her mother's hand, "Mum, can't I go…""You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet," replied Mrs Weasley, who'd been putting up with this request from her daughter since breakfast, "All right, Percy, you go first."Percy pushed his trolley forward towards the wall and disappeared through to the other side."Fred, you're next.""I'm not Fred, I'm George," replied Fred rolling his eyes. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother. Can't you tell I'm George.""Sorry George dear.""Only joking, I am Fred," he stated pushing his trolley forward."Hurry up," ordered George, following his twin close behind.The sound of the platform washed over them as they arrived on the other side of the secret entranceway. The twins quickly moved so as not to block the way for the rest of their family. They could see a number of familiar faces amongst the hustle and bustle of the crowd. Lee Jordan waved at them from the centre of a small crowd of students which included fellow Gryffindor third years Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson. Their dreadlocked friend was beaming as he pointed to the box he was holding in his hand."That must be that tarantula his uncle got him," Fred nodded towards his friend.George nodded in agreement as his gaze flittered along the platform as he tried to spy other people he knew. His attention was drawn to a young black haired boy who was struggling on his own to get his oversized trunk up into the train."Want a hand?" George asked."Yes, please," replied the boy looking grateful."Oi, Fred! C'mere and help!" George called to his brother."By Godric," complained Fred as the three boys worked together to hoist the trunk up the steps of the train, "what have you got in here?"Eventually they managed to half carry half drag the trunk into the carriage. A beautiful snowy white owl watched them from its cage as they at last tucked it away in the corner of the compartment."Thanks," said the boy, pushing a hand through his hair to move it away from his eyes, as he did so a small but distinct lightening bolt scar was visible on his forehead."What's that?" asked Fred pointing at it."Blimey," said George before the young boy could answer, "are you…""He is," said Fred smiling "aren't you?""What?" replied the boy."Harry Potter," chorused the boys."Oh him," said the boy, "I mean, yes I am."The twins suddenly found themselves dumbstruck and unable to say anything. Instead they found themselves just staring at Harry who stood there with a look of obvious discomfort about the whole thing."Fred, George, are you there?" the voice of Mrs Weasley filtered onto the train."Coming mum," they replied, giving Harry one last look before jumping off the train and back onto the platform, where their mother was accosting Ron with a handkerchief to try and remove some dirt from his nose."Mum, geroff," Ron complained, finally managing to wriggle free from her grasp."Ahh, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie," said George in a teasing baby voice."Shut up," countered Ron, rubbing his nose with his hand."Where's Percy?" asked Mrs Weasley looking down the platform."He's coming now," responded Fred nodding towards their approaching brother, who had already changed into his Hogwarts' robes. Fred suspected this was due to the fact that he could now display his shiny prefect's badge prominently on his chest."Can't stay long mother," Percy said, pointing a thumb over his shoulder, "I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves…""Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" interrupted George pretending to act surprised, "you should have said something about it, we had no idea.""Hang on," added Fred tapping his lips thoughtfully with a finger, "I think I remember him saying something about it.""Once…""Or twice…""A minute…""All summer…""Oh, shut up," snapped Percy looking annoyed."How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said George prodding his older brother in the shoulder."Because he's a prefect," replied Mrs Weasley, "all right dear, well have a good term. Send me an owl when you get there." She kissed Percy on the cheek; he gave one more withering look at his brothers before heading back up towards the front of the train. Mrs Weasley turned to the twins, "now you two, this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've… you've blown up a toilet or…""Blown up a toilet?" Fred chimed in, "we've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though," admitted George, "thanks, mum.""It's not funny," Mrs Weasley said warningly, she looked fondly at her youngest son, "and look after Ron.""Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us," Fred said ruffling his brother's hair."Shut up," Ron retorted battering Fred's hand away and trying to smooth back down his hair."Hey mum," said George eagerly, ignoring Ron's look of annoyance, "guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?""You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?" Fred nodded his head back in the direction of where they'd help Harry onto the train."Who?""Harry Potter!" exclaimed Fred, Ginny let out a delighted squeal."Oh mum, can I go on the train and see him?" asked Ginny excitedly jumping up and down, "mum? Please?""You've already seen him Ginny," stated Mrs Weasley firmly, "and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really Fred?" How do you know?""Asked him," stated Fred smiling, "saw his scar. It's really there; like lightning.""Poor dear," said Mrs Weasley looking deeply concerned, "no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.""Never mind that," dismissed Fred waving his hand, "do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?""I forbid you to ask him Fred," warned Mrs Weasley looking serious, "No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.""All right," said Fred holding his hands up defensively, "keep your hair on."A loud whistle emanated from the front of the train, and parents quickly began ushering their children on board and biding them goodbye."Hurry up," ordered Mrs Weasley, practically pushing the three boys on board. They, reluctantly, leaned out so she could give each of them a kiss on the cheek, while Ginny began to cry."Don't Ginny," said Fred rolling his eyes, "we'll send you loads of owls.""We'll send you a Hogwarts' toilet seat," added George."George!""Only joking, mum."The train pulled slowly out of the station while Ginny tried to keep up along side and wave them off. It soon rounded a corner and the platform disappeared from view. Ron sidled down the corridor and pulled open the door to one of the carriages and stepped inside."Did you see where Lee got on?" George asked his twin."Further down the train," Fred pointed along the corridor, "near the middle I think.""Hey Ron," said George sticking his head into the carriage their younger brother had entered. It was the same one that they'd helped Harry Potter move his belongings into earlier, "listen, we're going down the middle of the train, Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there."Right," mumbled Ron."Harry," said Fred over his brother's shoulder, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother, See you later then."The twins left their brother in the compartment and walked along the corridor of the train. Outside, as the train began to pick up speed, the various buildings in London were whistling by the window. Finally, after looking in a number of carriages, the twins found their friends."You'll never guess who we just met?" said George as they slid open the door to the compartment that Lee, Alicia and Angelina, were occupying."Who?" asked Lee as the tarantula in the box once again tried to force the lid open with one of its long hairy legs, making Alicia shudder slightly."Potter," beamed Fred."Harry Potter?""No," frowned Fred, "Steve Potter, lead singer of the Screaming Banshees. Of course Harry Potter, know any other famous Potter due to start at Hogwarts?""How do you know it was him?" asked Angelina, as the twins sprawled themselves down into the free seats."We saw his scar," explained George tapping his finger on the protruding leg of the tarantula causing it to withdraw itself back into the box."The lightning bolt one on his head?""What other one would he have?" replied George shaking his head, "honestly Lee, you are a bit slow today.""Give me a break," yawned Lee covering his mouth with his hand, "I had to get up really early this morning, plus I'd been up all night with Reginald, I think he is coming down with something he keeps losing his hair.""You called it Reginald?" asked Alicia raising an eyebrow while looking down at the box in Lee's hand."Yeah after my Uncle, he got it for me.""He must be so proud," replied Alicia frowning slightly."So what's he like?" asked Angelina eagerly.."Oh he's great," explained Lee enthusiastically, "he can spin a web in no time, and I think I've almost taught him how to beg for food.""What?" Angelina's brow crinkled in momentary confusion, "no, not your spider, I meant Harry Potter, what's he like?""Seems alright I guess," shrugged George, "didn't really say much.""Probably a bit big headed," explained Alicia, "you know what these celebrities are like.""Oh yeah," agreed Fred, "Ottery St Catchpole is just teaming with celebrities; I can't walk down our lane without bumping into them.""You know what I mean," reiterated Alicia before adding thoughtfully, "I wonder if he remembers anything about that night.""I dunno, probably not seeing as he was only a baby at the time," replied Lee."Our mum actually banned us from asking him about it," shrugged George."Not that it matters," said Fred scratching the back of his neck, "our brother Ron is in the same carriage as him. No doubt he'll ask him about it, he's a subtle as a brick.""So I guess red hair isn't the only thing that runs in your family," grinning Angelina. She changed her gaze to Lee who was casually stroking one of tarantula legs poking out of the top of the box, "Lee, seriously pack that thing away, the last thing you want is it escaping on the train.""I suppose you're right," sighed Lee, he pulled out some string from his pocket and wrapped it tightly around the box which had a number of air-holes punched into the side of it.The group spent most of the journey talking about Harry Potter, this soon translated to the entire train talking about as the twins eagerly informed anyone who happened to be passing by their carriage that he was aboard. Most people seemed to be very interested in this snippet of news, and soon the twins had become the unofficial spokespeople for the boy despite only having briefly met him."Is he tall?" asked one girl from Ravenclaw who the twin's had never once spoken to but who had now been hovering outside their compartment for the last half hour firing questions at the twins, "I bet he's tall.""Oh yes," agreed George nodding wholeheartedly, "he's nearly six foot tall.""What colour eyes does he have?" asked another girl, this time from Hufflepuff."Er… brown," Fred answered taking a wild stab in the dark.The barrage of questions continued for a while, with the twins making up more and more ridiculous answers until their audience decided that they probably weren't the most reliable source for information and began filtering back to their own compartments. The group settled back into their seats while they continued the journey to Hogwarts, aside from being interrupted by a bushy haired girl and a round faced boy looking for a missing toad, they were left alone for the rest of the trip.The train eventually pulled itself into Hogsmeade station, by now it was getting late and the Sun had already dropped over the horizon leaving a dark sky with numerous twinkling stars. Everyone, aside from the first years who Hagrid had taken to the lake, waited patiently to board the horseless carriages which took them up to the school.By the time they'd reached the Great Hall, it was already very packed, and a low hum of excited conversation echoed around the room. The third years all grouped together along one of the tables and took the opportunity to wave, or in the twins' case shout, hello across to other students sitting further away from them.Soon the last of the students filtered into the room and everyone took their seats while they waited for the first years to arrive. McGonagall, dressed in her usual emerald-green robes, approached and stood at the threshold of the Great Hall and looked towards there head table where Dumbledore sat. He gave her a slight nod and she disappeared from the doorway.A few minutes later she was back with the group of fresh faced first years, all looking thoroughly nervous. Along with their brother Ron, the twins noticed the boy and girl toad hunters from earlier were also present in the pack. Not that it made any difference. A twelve foot monster with two heads and four arms could have been in the group and it still would have gone unnoticed compared to the biggest distraction."Is that him?""Which one is Potter?"Everyone was talking in low voices, trying not to draw the disapproving look of McGonagall as she led the students up to the top of the room where the teacher's table sat."Look at Ron's face," George whispered to his brother, "he looks like he is going to faint at any minute.""Well I suppose that is to be expected," admitted Fred, "we did convince him he was going to have to wrestle a troll or something."The group stopped in a line facing the rest of the students, while they had their backs to the teacher's table. In front on them McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool before sitting the Sorting Hat upon it. The first years watched with a mixture of awe and anxiety as the hat suddenly sprang into life and began to croon its traditional song.When it had finished the whole hall burst into applause as the Sorting Hat bowed appreciatively to each of the four House tables before becoming still once again."What do you reckon? Ravenclaw?" asked George as the twins and Lee started playing the game of guess which House the first year belongs too. They had yet to decide on a catchier name for the pastime. The first new student was called forward; Hannah Abbott, a pinked faced girl with blonde pigtails."Na," disagreed Fred, "did you just she her stumble when she was called? Hufflepuff all the way I tell you."Fred's guess was confirmed moments after the Sorting Hat was lowered onto the girl's head. Hufflepuff table gave a loud cheer while the other tables joined in with polite applause. The game continued through each of the first years, until the first Gryffindor was named; a girl by the name of Lavender Brown. The table erupted with cheers, while Fred and George banged their hands on the table and added the odd wolf-whistle for good measure. The names continued to be called out and the group of unsorted first years dwindled until there was only a handful left."Potter, Harry!" called McGonagall, instantly the whispered began snaking their way around the room."Potter, did she say?""The Harry Potter?"Despite the twins attempt to inform the whole school whilst on the Hogwarts' Express, it seemed that there was still a number of people who didn't realise that Harry Potter was starting that year. Everyone craned their necks to try and get a good look at him just as the Sorting Hat dropped down onto his head and over his eyes."That's Harry Potter?" said Angelina sounding a bit disappointed, "you said he was nearly six foot tall.""I decided to round up to the nearest foot," explained George shrugging."So how tall are you?""Nearly six foot.""Idiot."Before George could argue the Sorting Hat exclaimed, "Gryffindor!" The majority of the table jumped to their feet as they cheered."We've got Potter!" chanted the delighted twins as Percy, who had been seated next to the new first years to welcome them to the House, shook the young boy's hand before he sat down next to Nearly Headless Nick."I can't believe we got him," said Lee beaming as the Sorting Ceremony continued."Got him? He's not a wizard card you know," complained Alicia rolling her eyes."True," agreed Fred, "I doubt we'd be able to swap him for an original Merlin card for a start.""We could try," said George thoughtfully, before shaking his head, "now we're just being silly.""Well at least you finally realised it," said Alicia."Yeah," agreed George, "no one would ever swap an original Merlin card."The second to last person to be sorted was the twins' younger brother Ron, who was now looking thoroughly nervous and a rather pale shade of green. The hat was lowered onto his head and it more or less instantly called out, "Gryffindor!""Well I guess that shows the Sorting Hat can't be right all the time," commented George clapping along with the rest of the table."Yeah," agreed Fred, "if anyone in our family had Hufflepuff written all over them it would be Ron.""What makes you say that?" asked Angelina as Ron took his seat with the rest of the first years."Well," said George scratching his chin, "we pinned him down the other day and wrote Hufflepuff all over him."





--------




The usual excitement of the first few days back at Hogwarts had been intensified by the presence of the famed Harry Potter, which in turn seemed to increase the standing of every Gryffindor student in the school by way of association. Those students in the other three Houses were constantly questioning their counterparts on what he was like, did he remember anything about Voldemort, where has he been, but in most cases people would have to admit that they hadn't really had much of a chance to talk to him. Of course these people weren't Fred and George, who delighted in revealing every facet of the first year's life without having to worry about simple things such as facts or the truth."Oh yes," nodded Fred as he and George spoke enthusiastically to two fourth year Ravenclaw girls who, up until last year, had treated the twins with rather a bit of disdain but, on finding out they personally knew Harry Potter, suddenly adapted their view of the twins to rather interesting."He completely remembers confronting You-Know-Who," admitted George looking serious, "if fact he went into a lot of detail about the whole thing the first night he was here.""Really?" asked one the astounded girls, Valerie Huffington. Her eyes opened wide in awe."Really," agreed Fred smiling, "we'll be happy to retell the whole story to you after Quidditch practice.""Oh, did we mention we were on the Quittich team?" beamed George trying to look casual about the whole thing."No, but we knew that already," replied the second girl, who the twins had learnt was called Catherine Margo."You did?" George answered looking thoroughly pleased with himself."Well, you are two redheaded twins," said Catherine nodding towards George's hair, "it's not really that difficult to spot you during a game.""We do make for pretty impressive viewing when we are in full flow on our brooms," Fred winked at the two girls."Fred! George!" Angelina called down the corridor, she was standing next to Alicia and both of them had their brooms slung over their shoulders, "are you coming or not? You're gonna be late.""Who's that?" asked Valerie, her brow crinkled as she frowned at the intruders, "your girlfriends?""They wish," said George waving at the two Gryffindor Chasers, "they've been asking us out since our first year, but they are a bit to immature for us.""Didn't you get put in detention the other day for sliding down the banisters while doing an impression of a chicken?" Catherine raised an eyebrow."No," said George shaking his head, "I'll think you find it was an impression of a turkey.""Right," said Valerie slowly, "look, we'd better get going.""So we'll see you after Quiddich practice then?" asked Fred."Well, we've a lot of homework to be getting on with," admitted Catherine, "maybe another time."The twins watched as the two girls disappeared down the corridor."You had to slide down the banister didn't you?" muttered Fred shaking his head as he stooped to pick up his broom."Lee bet me I wouldn't," replied George as he too retrieved his broom from its resting place, "besides what was with that 'impressive viewing when we are in full flow' nonsense.""That wasn't nonsense," retorted Fred as the two of them made their way down to the Quidditch pitch, "we do look impressive.""Take your time why don't you?" said Oliver sarcastically as the twins finally arrived at the pitch alongside the rest of the team, "it's not like we have better things to be doing than waiting for you.""Really?" asked George, "because I'm a bit tired and if it's okay I could probably do with a nap.""Hey if he's allowed a nap then so am I," added Fred."No one is having a nap," Oliver stated firmly. He rubbed his temple with his fingers; over the summer he'd forgotten how difficult it was to manage the twins, "we're just having a bit of a run out today to see if everyone has gotten rusty over the summer.""Who's replacing Miro?" asked Alicia, counting the other members of the team in her head, "and what about a Seeker?""I'm holding tryouts in the next few days to fill those positions," admitted Oliver, "although I'm thinking that Katie Bell did quite well during the tryouts last year so she'll be a good bet to replace Miro. We could have a problem coming up with a replacement Seeker though, last year no one came close to being as good as Charlie in the tryouts.""What about the first years? There might be someone good in there," said Angelina bouncing the Quaffle in her hand."I doubt it," shrugged Oliver, "there hasn't been a first year in a Quidditch team for over a hundred years. I suppose it is always a possibility though, but we can instantly discount those from muggle backgrounds since we need someone who can fly a broom. Hey, your brother is a Gryffindor isn't he? What's his name? Russ?""You mean Ron?" asked George looking sceptical."That's it, Ron," nodded Oliver looking excited, "is he any good? I mean Charlie was a fantastic player and from what I hear Bill was pretty good too.""Ahem," coughed Fred theatrically."Yes," said Oliver rolling his eyes, "you two are alright as well I suppose, when you aren't being pains of course.""Of course," agreed Fred, "anyway as far as Ron is concerned I wouldn't be holding my breath, we normally make him play in goal at home so I don't think he'll make a good Seeker.""Oh well," said Oliver looking a bit crestfallen, "hopefully someone will turn up for the tryouts who didn't last year.""That's the spirit," George punched his team captain playfully on the arm, "nothing like brimming with optimism to instil confidence in the team."The practice seemed to be straightforward enough; as Oliver had iterated before, it wasn't really a full-on practice but more of a relaxed bit of session so that they could all get use to playing with each other again. The twins had sensed this lack of discipline on Oliver's part early on and had taken to messing around whilst on their brooms, much to the amusement of Alicia and Angelina."You're such an idiot," laughed Angelina as Fred hung upside-down on his broom, his legs folded over the top of it as he caught a pass from his brother. "What happens if you fall off?""It's okay," said Alicia, catching the Quaffle as Fred threw it to her awkwardly, "he'll only land on his head, it's not as if it'll do any damage.""Of course it'll do damage," complained George, heroically leaping to the defence of his brother, "it'll probably dent the pitch for a start."The light soon began to fail and it wasn't long before it became too dark to play. The five Quidditch players wandered back towards the school with their brooms slung over their shoulders as Oliver carried the Quaffle under his arm. They chatted animatedly about the various Quidditch games they had each been to in recent years and quickly found themselves stepping through the archway back into the school."All right Mr Filch?" George asked the caretaker who was busy mopping a patch of floor."What do you want?" snapped Filch. His immediate thought of handing out punishments for them being out of their House was quickly extinguished as his eyes flickered towards the brooms on the students shoulders and realised they were coming back from Quidditch practice."Just seeing how our favourite member of staff is doing," Fred pointed out kindly."How I'm doing?" spat Filch waving the end of the mop at the two boys, "How I'm doing? I'm doing bloody marvellous considering you lot left me to rot in that tomb in Eqypt.""That wasn't our fault," said George, recalling their exploits during the school trip the previous year. Oliver, Angelina and Alicia decided that this was probably the best time for them to slip away back up to Gryffindor House. "Enoch said that the exit was only one way and that they had to wait for you to decide to find your way out.""You'd think someone would have told me that wouldn't you?" retorted Filch dunking his mop back into the bucket of dirty water."We didn't know," countered George shrugging his shoulders."Or you could have come back to find me before you left the tomb," added Filch bitterly."Ah well yeah I suppose we could have," admitted Fred reluctantly, this was followed by an awkward silence which was finally ended by George."So how long…""Three days," snorted Filch."Three days?" asked the twins in unison."And nights," added Filch."Why did you wait so long?" enquired George frowning."Oh I don't know," replied Filch sarcastically, "it might have had something to do with the fact that there were a bunch of nutters on the outside ready to kill me as well as giant bugs and monsters made of dirt roaming around the tunnels. All in all staying put seemed like the smartest idea at the time.""Yeah, but three days?""I was half dead from thirst by the time I came stumbling out of that cave," grumbled Filch, "and I'm blaming you two for all of that, you and your uncle.""How is it our fault?" asked Fred looking across at his equally astounded brother."If you and your stupid uncle hadn't gone on that idiotic treasure hunt I would have been all safe and cosy staying here at the school.""Er… we didn't make you follow us," George pointed out."Yeah? Well…" Filch stuttered holding a finger up warningly as he thought of the best possible comeback that would put the twins in their place, "… shut up.""Well it's been a pleasure as always Mr Filch," smiled George much to the caretaker's annoyance, "but I think it is getting late so we'll be heading off to bed.""Good night Mr Filch," said Fred waving his spare hand as the twins left the caretaker alone with his work. Fred pointed to a spot on the floor as they were leaving, "by the way, you missed a bit.""I can't believe him sometimes," complained George as the two boys made their way up the stairs, "if he hadn't been sneaking around, listening in on conversations that had nothing to do with him then he wouldn't have got stuck in that tomb. Yet somehow, it is all our fault.""I know," agreed Fred as they rounded the corner and waited patiently for the top of the stairs to stop moving to a new place, "I wouldn't mind if we'd stuck him in a tomb deliberately, but getting blamed for something that we didn't do, it's just so wrong.""Exactly, although to be fair if we had thought of it, we probably would have done it," admitted George thoughtfully.The twins soon reached the portrait of the fat lady and gave the appropriate password to be allowed into the House. There was only a few occupants left in the room including Lee Jordan who was sitting in one of the chairs, with his leg flopped over one of the armrests while he read from a large and colourful book entitled 'Chudley Cannons – Why?'"Hiya guys," he called over the top of the book, "good practice?""Yeah it was pretty easy," admitted George dropping down into one of the chairs and resting his broom against the side of a table.""Pretty easy?" frowned Lee, "Oliver must be going soft in his old age.""Oi enough of the 'old' thank you very much," snapped Oliver as he stepped out from the stairway up to the boys' dormitories, "I'm in the prime of life I'll have you know.""Yeah, it's all down hill from here for you," said Fred from the comfy recess of his chair. "So what's that?""It's a notice about the Quidditch tryouts," said Oliver holding up a piece of parchment before securing it to the notice board, "I expect you two to be there.""Why do we have to tryout?" said Fred looking annoyed."No, I don't mean you have to tryout," explained Oliver reading a few of the other notices, "I just want you there to help me decide who should fill the Chaser and Seeker spots. Angelina and Alicia are helping out too.""It's on a Saturday morning," George complained having stood up to read the notice himself, "do you really need us there?""No, not really," admitted Oliver shrugging."Good.""Although I guess that means I'll have to change the notice so that it'll say the tryouts are for the Beater positions as well," said Oliver thoughtfully, preparing to take down the parchment."Steady on Oliver," George put his hand on the parchment to stop it from being taken off of the board, "if it is that important to you, then Fred will be there.""Just Fred?""Fine," sighed George, "I'll be there too, although I don't know why I'll be needed if Fred is there.""That's easy," replied Oliver, pushing the parchment back into place, "with both of you there I don't have to worry that either of you are going to end up in detention and miss practice.""Hey," responded Fred from his chair, "I'll have you know that we hardly ever get detention any more.""Only because you don't get caught," explained Oliver."What more do you want?""Er... how about you don't do stuff that'll get you into trouble in the first place?""I don't get it," admitted Fred frowning."Yeah, where's the fun in that?" asked George looking equally puzzled.The following morning, in the Great Hall, there was a buzz along the Gryffindor table as the majority of the students had read the notice about the Quidditch tryouts and were keen to compete for a place."Oh, heads up," said Lee looking up at the windows from his breakfast. A large number of owls swooped in from above carrying various packages and letters to the addressees along the table. Everyone reached out to grab their post as it was dropped from above, some with varying degrees of success compared to others."It's only a letter," said Lee looking down at Fred who was now sprawled on his back having stretched out to catch an envelope and promptly fallen backwards off of the bench."That's not the point Lee," winced Fred as he pushed himself up from the ground, "how would it have looked if I, the star player of our Quidditch team, were to have missed catching it?""Whereas being slumped on the floor is so much better?""Exactly," said Fred finally getting back into his seat. He looked down at the envelope, frowned and handed it to Lee, "oh, it's for you.""Thanks.""I caught ours," said George helpfully, holding up four letters. He passed two across to Fred while he opened one of the others and began to read."Cheers," said Fred ripping the first one opened, "oh it's from Charlie… 'having a great time… yada-yada-yada-yada… Romania lovely this time of year…blah blah blah… dragon burn… all the best.' Seems to be enjoying himself. Who's have you got?""From mum," said George, not looking up from his letter."What does she say?" asked Fred pulling open the second letter, which turned out to be from their other brother Bill."It's not so much of a letter as it is a list of crimes and other things she found in our room," admitted George, "she found our exploding joke door knob we bought from Zonko's last year.""I thought I'd lost that," replied Fred thoughtfully, reading from his own letter, "apparently Bill is re-examining that tomb of Kai, there is a lot of excitement about it. Wonder if we'll get any reward for discovering it in the first place.""Well technically Filch was the first one to find it," George pointed out. "Damn, mum found our stack of dungbombs hidden in the garden; apparently the gnomes had got hold of them.""What would gnomes want with dungbombs?" asked Fred, "anyway, Filch was only first down into the tomb because you pushed....""Accidentally bumped," George corrected his brother."Sorry, 'accidentally bumped' him," Fred finished his previous sentence using his brothers amended phrase."Apparently mum's favourite casserole dish is missing and she thinks we might know something about it," George informed his brother, "how's Bill getting along anyway?""Oh fine," admitted Fred, "aside from the Kai tomb, they have found another excavation site so it looks like he is going to be busy for the next while at least.""Can you check these for me?" said George passing the letter from their mum over to his brother, "to be honest I can't remember doing half this stuff.""Sure, lets have a look," Fred ran his finger down the letter, "yep, that was us, and that, oh god that was definitely us, remember? We had to leave our windows open over night to get rid of the smell.""Oh yeah, the casserole dish was ruined," George said remembering. He picked up the last letter and pulled it from the envelope, "hey, this one is from Enoch.""How's he getting on?" asked Lee who, like most of the students at Hogwarts, had come to like the twins' uncle very much during his time as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher."You know Enoch," replied George, "he's not happy unless he is up to his neck in trouble.""Sounds familiar.""Yeah, Fred seems to take after him a lot," admitted George continuing to read from the letter, "it looks like Enoch is having fun, something about a bit of problem with the authorities down in South America, says it's just a misunderstanding… oh hello Professor."George had stopped reading as the head of Gryffindor House was standing next to him with her arms folded and her lips pressed tightly together."I was wondering if you two gentlemen could help me with something," she said looking between Fred and George."We'll do our best Professor," replied Fred trying to look helpful."Yesterday afternoon, whilst I was gazing out of my window I noticed a very strange sight indeed," McGonagall continued, "it appeared to be one of the school owls struggling to carry a package that looked very much like a wrapped up toilet seat. Of course this seemed rather odd to me, so I asked Mr Filch to check each and every toilet in the school to see if any were missing and can you guess what he found?""Er…" George was on the verge of making some joking remark but catching one look at Professor McGonagall's face was enough to convince him that it probably wouldn't have been the wisest course of action."He found that in the third floor boys toilets one of them was missing a seat, I don't suppose that either of you would know anything about this?""It's news to us Professor," replied George exuding complete innocence from every pore."Yes I thought as much," admitted McGonagall, "which is why I decided to dispatch a quick letter of my own to your mother.""You did?" asked Fred slowly, a slight knot forming in his stomach."Yes, it very simply stated that if by pure chance a Hogwarts' toilet seat does get delivered to your house that she should let me know immediately along with who sent it. Destruction of school property is looked on very dimly here.""It's looked on dimly by us too," replied George still managing to maintain a look of purity."I'm glad that is the case," McGonagall stated before heading off towards the kitchen table."I thought you said we wouldn't get caught," hissed George once the Transfiguration teacher had moved out of earshot."How was I to know that she'd be looking out of her window?" countered Fred hurriedly. "Or that she would asked Filch to check the toilets?""We'll have to ask Ginny to hide it," reasoned George, "do you reckon if we sent an owl now it would get there before the other one?""It left yesterday," said Fred shaking his head, "even carrying the toilet seat wouldn't slow it down that much.""Damn," swore George, "how else could we get a message to Ginny?""Through the Floo-Network," stated Lee quickly."Right," said Fred looking serious, "I'll head through one of the tunnels to Hogsmeade, sneak into one of the buildings and use their Floos to quickly go home. I tell Ginny to hide the seat if it arrives. While you tell Quirrel that I wasn't feeling well and have gone to see Madam Pomfrey. Of course we'll have to work out a plan in case Quirrell checks with Pomfrey.""Or you could just use the Floo in our Common Room," said Lee, destroying an otherwise flawless plan."You can't travel using the Common Room Floos," said George shaking his head, "they aren't big enough.""Not to travel," admitted Lee, "but you can still stick your head in and send a message. Why do you think there is Floo-Powder stored on the mantelpiece?""There is?""You two really don't pay a lot of attention do you?" said Lee rolling his eyes, "have you ever wondered why every now and then, there are people in our Common Room either chatting to the fire or have their head stuck into it?""I just thought they were cold."The twins quickly sprung up from the benches and hurried up the stairs as fast as they could, taking a couple of short cuts on the way to make their progress quicker. They burst into the Common Room, and were momentarily stopped in their tracks. In front of the fireplace was someone on all fours, they couldn't tell who it was since the person's head had disappeared from view and seemed to be buried amongst the smoke and flames of the fire."We don't have time for this," concluded Fred grabbing a handful of Floo-Power from a pot on top of the mantelpiece, using his other hand he grabbed the back of students top and pulled them out of the fire.Angelina looked up at the twins with an expression of puzzlement and annoyance."George will explain," Fred said before pushing his head into the fireplace, from the neck up he disappeared from view. His muffled voice could be heard in the Common Room, "sorry to interrupt Mrs Johnson, but I have to use the Floo, it's an emergency."Fred pulled his head back out, stated the Weasley home address before throwing the black powder in his hand back down onto the fire and returning his face to the flame."Well?" Angelina asked George raising an eyebrow."Like he said," George pointed at his brother, "it's an emergency.""Ginny? Ginny?" hissed the muted voice of Fred, "shh keep it down, I don't want mum hearing." Only Fred's side of the conversation could be heard. "Has the post turned up yet? Good, when it does, there will be a toilet seat addressed to you. Yes, a toilet seat. Because it's funny. Just make sure you hide it from mum, okay? Brilliant, nice one Ginny. See you.""Let me get his straight," said Angelina doing a remarkable impression of McGonagall with her arms folded and lips pursed, "you, cut short my conversation with my mum, because you sent your sister a toilet seat and you wanted her to keep it hidden from your mum.""Yeah," smiled Fred his cheeks smudged with soot."And that counts as an emergency does it?""Well, what would you call it?""I'd call it 'two idiots playing a stupid prank that went wrong'," admitted Angelina looking annoyed."What's the difference?" asked George frowning.

Saturday came and went with the Quidditch tryouts providing mixed results. On one hand they managed to find a replacement Chaser for Miro Franca: as predicted Katie Bell, who had almost made the team the previous year, proved to be the best person available for the task. She had managed to improve her game during the last twelve months, mainly down to lots of early morning practicing over the summer which impressed the Gryffindor Captain to no end. The downside however was the fact that the last remaining position of Seeker, which was arguably the one area in which no team could be lacking, was proving to be a difficult one to fill."How long has he been like that?" asked Angelina, whispering to George in the Common Room, Alicia, Fred and the newest addition to the team were also standing next to them in a quiet little huddle."About half an hour," replied George quickly looking up at the clock hung on the wall.Oliver Wood was sitting in one of the large armchairs in the corner of the room, staring intensely at a piece of parchment attached to a clipboard. He had a look of pure concentration etched onto his face as he tapped his finger against the paper over and over."Should we check if he is okay?" wondered Katie in a concerned voice as she looked from one member of the team to another."Probably not," admitted Fred shaking his head, "you haven't dealt with Oliver much have you? How can I put this gently?""Oliver is crazy," ventured Alicia, the group still staring at the lone figure in the corner."Well everyone loves Quidditch," replied Katie, shrugging one of her shoulders."No, you don't seem to be getting this," said George shaking his head, "Oliver literally lives and breathes the game. I heard that on one History of Magic essay he wrote seventeen and a half feet on Quidditch.""Nothing wrong with being knowledgeable about the game," said Katie."The essay subject wasn't even about Quidditch, it was about the formation of the Ministry of Magic," explained George."Okay I suppose that is a little…" Katie's face wrinkled under her frown."Crazy?" finished George."Yeah, with a capital 'K'," added Fred to looks that were equal measures of confusion and pity."There is one thing that you can't fault him on though," said George thoughtfully, looking back at their Captain."It's not his spelling that's for sure," muttered Angelina under her breath."Not Fred," replied George rolling his eyes, "I mean Oliver.""Oh, what's that then?""This," George reached over to a table positioned under a window and picked up an apple that had been left there unwanted. He pulled his arm back and hurled it towards Oliver with deadly accuracy. There was a loud smacking sound as the fruit slammed into the fifth year's palm. His hand had snaked out in a blur and caught the apple in midair. Without taking his eyes off of the parchment, Oliver lifted the apple to his mouth and took a large bite out of the side of it."Okay, that was impressive," admitted Katie nodding her approval, "although, slightly unsettling.""Wait for it," advised George still watching the Gryffindor Captain in the same way a cat does when it's fascinated by a piece of moving string.There was the sound of crunching as Oliver began to chew his way through his mouthful of food. His face suddenly changed from an expression of concentration to one of confusion as he stopped chewing and looked down at the apple held in his hand. He glanced to his left, then his right before looking up and seeing the rest of the team for the first time."You alright Oliver?" asked George, trying to pretend that they hadn't all been staring at him."Yeah," replied Oliver slowly, he looked down at the fruit in his hand, "I must just be tired, I don't even remember taking an apple from the table at dinner.""Oh I get that all the time," admitted Fred as the group wandered over, "I'm always finding stuff in my pockets, and I have no idea how they got there in the first place.""That's because you keep putting on my clothes," complained George, he leant on the armrest of the chair and looked over Oliver's shoulder at the clipboard, "so what's this then?""It's my notes from Saturday on the people that tried out for the Seeker position," admitted Oliver sighing and leaning back in the chair, "I've written down all their strengths and weaknesses.""You have?" asked George taking a close look at the writing. "There doesn't seem to be a lot of strengths written down.""There wasn't much to write down," replied Oliver looking dejected."'Has short hair, won't get in his eyes', and that's what you call a strength?" said George reading from the notes."Well I had to put at least one strength down," shrugged Oliver sounded a bit defeated."Can I see that?" asked Katie taking the clipboard from him."McGonagall wants to see me later to find out how the tryouts went," Oliver grumbled, "I still don't know what I am going to do about a Seeker.""Oi Oliver, you're so mean," stated Katie who had flipped through the notes, she looked up at the rest of the team with an expression of annoyance, "he said I look liked Ursula Sarnia who plays for the Puddlemere United, she's got a face like a Ghoul.""Does she?" asked Oliver frowning with genuine puzzlement, "never really noticed that, she flies like a dream though, that's what I meant.""Really?" replied Katie sceptically."Actually I'd believe him on that," counselled Alicia, "watch this. Oliver, who was voted this year's most attractive witch in For Wizards' Magazine?""Erm… no idea.""Aurora Adelphi," sighed the twins in unison."And who was Britain's entrant in last year's Witch World competition?""Sorry," shrugged Oliver, "haven't got a clue.""Gillian Philexia," responded the twins."And what was the final score in the nineteen eighty five under nineteens' South England Regional Quidditch cup final?""One hundred and eighty to two hundred and forty, the Tiverton Dragons versus the Ashford Mongooses," Oliver said animatedly, "it was an amazing game, the Mongooses were on the back foot for most of it but they came through in the end. Superb game by Fertelli, scored seven goals in the first ten minutes, I think that still stands as a record…""I think I just proved my point," stated Angelina looking satisfied."Like we said…" Alicia whispered to Katie, leaving the last word unspoken."With a capital 'K'," added Fred leaning in between the two girls.Oliver spent most of the next few days moping around the school, permanently referring to his notes from the tryouts which he kept on his person at all times. Under the pressure of trying to decide who to make the new Seeker, he had become rather irritable and tended to snap at people if they bothered him too much. At this point Angelina had decided to try and keep Fred and George away from the Quidditch Captain, who didn't seem to fully appreciate their efforts in trying to cheer him up."I don't see why we have to stay away from him," complained George as they waited down at the Quidditch pitch for their scheduled practice session."Because he'll end up killing one, if not both, of you," replied Angelina leaning on her broom."And you'll miss us?" asked Fred smiling. "You're so sweet.""Nope that's not the reason I'm keeping you away from him," clarified the Chaser, "I actually I meant that he's having enough trouble finding a Seeker without having to worry about replacing you two.""No-one can replace us," stated George puffing out his chest, "we're just too amazing.""Yes, you've certainly amazed me a lot of the time," nodded Alicia, "although I'm thinking we're using slightly different meanings for the word.""Where's Oliver?" wondered Fred turning Katie's wrist over to look at her watch, "it's not like him to be late. Has anyone got the time? I left my watch upstairs.""It's quarter past seven," advised Alicia and Katie together."Half eleven," stated George before frowning. He tapped his watch a few times before holding it up to his ear."Idiot," muttered Angelina."There he is," said Katie pointing up towards the castle."Hang on," said Fred squinting as they watched the approaching figure, "it looks like he is smiling, so it certainly can't be Oliver.""Smiling? It looks like he is about to start skipping. I wonder what has him so happy," said Angelina frowning."And you said we couldn't cheer him up," Fred scolded her."Who said that it was you?""We were the only ones trying," reasoned Fred shrugging."Good evening team," Oliver flashed them all a wide smile as he reached them. He dropped his broom down on the floor and flicked the Quaffle held in the other hand towards Angelina who caught it deftly in one hand."You're certainly in a better mood," noted Alicia."And why shouldn't I be?" queried Oliver, "it's a lovely evening, the Sun is shining, not a cloud in the sky, we've found our Seeker, the birds are singing…""You found a Seeker?" asked George. "Who is it? It's not Haddington is it?""Which one was Haddington?" asked Fred."The one that kept making dragon sounds as he flew around.""Oh god yeah, not him.""Er… I've heard you two growling like dragons during practice," Alicia pointed out, poking George in the chest with his finger."Yeah," admitted George rubbing the sore spot on his chest with his hand, "but it's funny when we do it.""Do you want to hear who it is or not?" asked Oliver, there was an expectant pause as the group turned to look at their captain, "Harry Potter.""Harry Potter?" replied Fred looking as surprised as the rest of the team, "but he's a first year.""Yeah," agreed Alicia, "and I heard he grew up with muggles, he probably hasn't even flown a broom in his life.""Ha, wrong," said Oliver still looking pleased with himself, "he has flown a broom, just once mind you, today in fact.""Oh well that settles it then," admitted George, "if he's flown once then let's snatch him up quick before he is signed by a professional team.""On his first ever try on a broom he went into a fifty foot dive and caught a Rememberall," explained Oliver smiling wide."That's actually pretty impressive," said George nodding along with the rest of the team."Pretty impressive? On his first try?" asked Oliver."All right Oliver, calm down," soothed George, "last thing we need is your head exploding from overexcitement.""Or is it?" said Fred looking thoughtful for a few seconds before adding, "no, no, you're right. It is.""McGonagall is trying to sort out a broom for him," Oliver informed the team, "but I want it to remain a secret, so no telling anyone.""Why are you looking at us when you say that?" asked George looking hurt, he pointed at Angelina and Alicia, "they're the ones who gossip all the time.""Not about important stuff like Quidditch," countered Oliver."Wait a minute," interjected Alicia, "since when have we been gossips?""Who was the person that reported back to the whole of Gryffindor House that they'd seen Clare Edgely snogging Peter Battersby behind Greenhouse Two?" asked George."That was you.""Oh… yeah forgot about that," replied George scratching his chin. His eyes lit up for a second time, "ah, then how about the time that Wrafter from Ravenclaw split his trousers in the middle of the corridor, revealing his underwear with little baby ducks all over them, and before you could say 'quack' it was all over the school?""That would be you again," said Alicia folding her arms."Oh… damn," there was a slight pause as George tried to think of more examples, "how about when… oh hang on that was us as well. What about… no, no that was us too. Oh I know, the time that… wait no, that was dream…"Deciding that George could probably continue like this for the rest of the night Fred turned to Oliver, "fair enough, don't worry we'll keep it to ourselves."****"That must make him the youngest Quidditch player in over a century," said Lee looking thoroughly impressed."I know," agreed Fred, "apparently he is a natural on a broom.""Yeah," nodded George, "Oliver said that on his ever flight he dropped down into a two hundred foot dive and caught a marble with his eyes shut.""Well it's to be expected I suppose," admitted Lee, "after all he managed to defeat You-Know-Who when he was just a baby, so he's bound to be naturally talented at all things magical."The three boys were sat around one of the tables under a window in the Gryffindor Common Room, where they were writing out some letters. The twins had managed to last a whole twelve seconds before telling their friend about the new addition to the team. They were quite proud that they'd managed to last that long."That's what I figured," said George thoughtfully rubbing his chin."Plus it's a good move on the old mind games front," added Lee dipping a quill into an ink pot and scribbling away on a piece of parchment."Yes it is," agreed Fred, spoiling his look of serene wisdom by adding, "er… why?""Think about it," said Lee leaning forward, "not only do we already have some of the best players…""Some?" asked George looking up from writing his letter."Fine," said Lee rolling his eyes, "we already have all the best players, but on top of that, we've now added the one person who managed to defeat You-Know-Who to the line up. The other teams will be petrified of us.""That's true," replied Fred tapping his quill on the page in front of him."Who'd have thought we'd have Harry Potter in our Quidditch team?" commented Lee shaking his head in wonder."This is keeping it to yourself?" asked Oliver tersely having approached the table."You didn't say we couldn't tell Lee," countered George shrugging."Keep it to yourself," repeated Oliver looking astounded, "what does that sound like to you?""If you had meant we couldn't tell Lee," Fred informed the fifth year, "then you should have specifically said 'and that includes Lee'.""Yourself. Keep it to yourself," Oliver said slowly, "I shouldn't have to say 'and that includes Lee' because 'keep it to yourself' implies that already.""But we tell Lee everything," replied George frowning, "he's like a third twin.""That would make him a triplet," Fred corrected his brother."Yes, that's right," nodded George in agreement, "he's our black, dreadlocked haired triplet.""He has our dad's eyes," added Fred."Do you two ever take things seriously?" sighed Oliver realising that the twins were completely oblivious to his annoyed state."Oh Merlin's Beard no," replied George shaking his head, "if we took things serious we'd be…""…idiots," Fred finished the sentence for him."I was gonna say Percy but it's basically the same thing," admitted George."Okay fine," said Oliver rubbing his forehead. He only seemed to get bad headaches when he had to deal with the twins. He turned to Lee, "don't tell anyone. And you two, don't tell anyone else. Okay?""Don't worry," advised George, "we'll keep it to ourselves."Oliver left the three boys to write their letters and he headed off mumbling something about visiting Madam Pomfrey for his headache. For a few moments the only sound at the table was that of scribbling quills."Who are you writing to?" asked George looking up."Charlie," said Fred using his wand to clear up a few rogue droplets of ice that had spilled onto his parchment, "I figured he'd like to hear that Potter is our new Seeker. What about you?""I'm letting Enoch in on the good news too, what about you Lee?""I'm telling my mum about it, she's a big Quidditch fan," explained Lee, there was a slight awkward silence as the three boys looked at each other."If he hadn't wanted us to tell our family Oliver would have added 'and that includes anyone outside of Hogwarts'," reasoned Lee shrugging."Exactly Lee," agreed George."See," added Fred, "that's why your dad's favourite."

"Come on then," said George as Lee led the twins down one of the many winding halls of the school, "where's this new passageway out of the school?""It better not be the one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy," warned Fred wagging a finger, "George and I found that one in our first week.""Oh," said Lee stopping in his tracks and looking thoroughly disappointed, he turned to look at the twins, "you know about that one then do you?""Yeah, it lets you out just outside the school walls," replied George nodding his head towards the window which opened out onto the school grounds."It was a good try though," admitted Fred slapping his friend on the back."Thanks," replied Lee scratching his chin, "shame though, I was looking forward to exploring that.""That's okay," shrugged George, "I'm sure we'll think of someway to keep ourselves amused tonight.""What do you have in mind?" asked Lee looking between his two friends, having known them for a couple of years he could spot when they were planning something. The first clue was normally whether or not they were awake, although he did suspect that they probably thought up most of their ideas in their dreams; it would have explained a lot."Well you know how we aren't supposed to go up onto the third floor corridor on the right hand side?""Yeah?""Er… okay that's pretty much it," admitted Fred sheepishly, "we're going to the third floor corridor on the right hand side.""Didn't Dumbledore say we could suffer a most painful death if we went there?" asked Lee looking uncertain."Yes.""Sounds good to me," said Lee rubbing his hands together, "what do you reckon? Down in the Common Room at midnight?""I'd say make it about eleven twenty," replied George, "that whole meeting at midnight stuff is all very over the top, I prefer to be subtle.""Yeah, if one word defines you two it's definitely 'subtle'," said Lee dryly."I would have gone with 'callow'," admitted Fred."Why? What does it mean?" asked Lee looking at his friend to see which part of him exuded a general feeling of callowness."I don't know," shrugged Fred, "but McGonagall put it on my report last year, and I got pretty good marks in my Transfiguration exam, so it's bound to be something good.."****"You guys ready?" whispered Lee in the dark of the dormitory, the faint snores of the other two occupants reverberating from their beds."Yeah," replied George pushing back the curtain surrounding his bed.The three boys made their way as silently as they could out of their room. Since they were doing it in the dark, the relative quiet was regularly interrupted by the sounds of one of them bumping into something, which usually preceded a flurry of curse words."That is going to leave a bruise," muttered Fred in the hallway as he rubbed the shin of his leg."They're still asleep," Lee informed them as he closed the door to their dormitory, "although I'm not entirely sure how.""Idiot," said George punching his brother on the arm."You left the cauldron there," Fred pointed out, "I wouldn't have tripped over it otherwise."The two of them bickered all the way down the stairs, the fire in the Common Room had almost gone out, leaving just the faintest light for them to guide their way across to the portrait hole. They had almost reached the exit when a voice spoke from the nearest chair, causing all three of them to jump at the unexpected noise."I can't believe you're going to do this."A lamp flickered on. Seated in the chair was one of the new first year girls. Her face quickly changed from a frown to one of slight embarrassment. Her cheeks flushed pink to match her dressing gown."Oh…s-sorry," she stammered quickly, caught off-guard, "I thought you were someone else.""Happens all the time," shrugged Fred, he nodded his head towards George, "people are always mistaking me for him.""It's Stephanie isn't it?" asked George."Hermione," corrected the girl."Close enough," shrugged George, "who were…""How is that close enough?" asked Lee raising his eyebrows."It's a girl's name," explained George, he pointed towards Hermione, "and she's a girl, so, close enough.""I'm glad I only share your looks and not your brains," admitted Fred. He turned to address Hermione, "who were you waiting for?""Oh, it doesn't matter," replied Hermione shaking her head slightly, "just a couple of first year boys were planning on sneaking out of the House tonight.""Honestly," George tutted, "you just can't rely on anyone these days can you?""Wait a minute," the frown had worked its way back onto Hermione's face, "where were you going?""We're sneaking out of the House," replied George unashamedly."But you can't.""Oh we can," said Fred informatively, "you just head out of the portrait and there you go, you've snuck out of the House. Is it snuck or sneaked?""I know you can sneak out of Gryffindor House," replied Hermione, "what I actually meant was that you shouldn't.""Snuck out… it just doesn't sound right you know? But then 'sneaked out' isn't any better.""Why shouldn't we?" this time it was George's turn to frown."Because it's against the rules," said Hermione raising her eyebrows."And?""Snook. We 'snook' out of the House. Nothing sounds right now.""What do you mean 'and'? It's against the rules," Hermione tried again."Yeah, I still can't see the actual problem," responded George shaking his head."The problem," Hermione stated slowly, "is that if you get caught, you'll cost us House Points.""Ah well that's easily solved," beamed George glad to finally be making some headway, "we won't get caught.""But that's not the point.""Look, Harriet…""Hermione," she corrected him through gritted teeth."That's what I said. Anyway, trust us, we've done this plenty of times," admitted George pressing his hand on his chest, "and we've never been caught. So, thanks for looking out for us but we'll be fine.""Yeah," agreed Fred, "we've snicked out of here plenty of times."Leaving the gob-smacked first year alone in the Common Room the three boys made their way through the portrait."Merlin's Beard," muttered Lee shaking his head, "how bossy was she?""I know," agreed Fred, "I bet she gets on well with McGonagall."The three boys had only made it a few steps before the came across another Gryffindor first year; a boy this time. He was curled up in the foetal position next to one of the walls quietly snoring away."We were never this weird when we were first years were we?" asked Lee as they crept passed the snoozing boy. He thought about what he'd just said, and the company he was with, "well, I was never that weird."The three boys made their way through the school using the various short cuts that had become second nature to them, and it wasn't long before they were at the third floor, close to where the corridor which had been designated out of bounds was. They passed by one of the classrooms where their Charms lessons were held and eventually came to the end of the corridor where a locked door barred them from progressing any further."Allow me," said Fred taking his wand out of the pocket of his jeans, he pointed at the keyhole of the door, "Alohamora!"There was a faint click and the door swung open, leaving a self-satisfied looking Fred to saunter on through."I never look that smug do I?" asked George."Only when you do something right," admitted Lee graciously, "so hardly ever."George and Lee followed Fred inside. The door closed slowly behind them. The three boys had frozen in their tracks and for good reason. They had definitely found the forbidden corridor.They were looking at a humongous three headed dog, which was laying across the middle of the corridor, each of its heads laid peacefully on the floor as faint growls emanated from each of them. Its body filled most of the room between the floor and the ceiling and blocked their view of the corridor behind it."Maybe this wasn't such a good idea," said Lee quietly in case he woke the sleeping beast."You know, I think I might have to agree with you on that one," said George staring unblinkingly at the animal."We might be able to sneak passed it," said Fred hopefully."We'd have to climb over it," George pointed out, "it's laid out across the whole width of the corridor.""I reckon we could manage it," ventured Fred.At that moment one of the heads of the dog gave a loud snort, before its jaws stretched as it yawned deeply, revealing rows of sharp deadly looking teeth."I think it's waking up," Lee said, his eyes opening wide in panic."Time to leave I think," admitted George reaching for the handle behind his back.He pulled the door open just as the dog opened one of its large oversized eyes and the three boys piled through."Why would anyone leave a dog like that in the middle of a corridor?" asked Fred jabbing his finger backwards at the closed door."Isn't it obvious?" shuddered Lee, who could still see the gaping jaws of the beast in his mind's-eye."School mascot?" George bent down to look through the keyhole at the animal."Nah," disagreed Fred shaking his head, "we've already got one of those.""We do?" asked George."Yeah," nodded Lee, "the Giant Squid.""Oh," frowned Fred, "I always thought it was the Whomping Willow.""I would have said it was Filch," admitted George. The three boys took a moment to picture the school's caretaker. "Maybe not.""So why the dog then?" Fred turned to Lee."What are dogs used for?" asked Lee. He quickly realised that his two friends were both trying to think up silly answers to the question so he decided to head them off at the pass by giving them the solution himself. "To guard things.""Ahh," said George tapping the side of his nose, "now you're talking. So how do we get passed a giant three headed dog?""We're going to need three giant bones," stated Fred firmly.The boys decided to head back towards Gryffindor House while they worked out a plan to get past the three headed dog. Before they left Fred used his wand to lock the door again, to make sure they didn't leave behind any evidence of their presence. They had only gone a short distance before Lee put a hand up to stop them in their tracks."Shh," said Lee quickly, "I think I can hear someone coming."The boys looked down the corridor; away from the direction of the three headed dog. Lee was right; a number of footsteps could be heard, they couldn't tell how many there were but they were definitely heading the boys' way as the sound was getting louder every second."Quick, in here," ordered George reaching for the closest classroom door and bounding inside.Theyclosed the door as quietly as they could and tried to press their ears against it to hear anything they could from the corridor. Unfortunately the thick oak door on its own would have made it difficult to manage this task without the three boys pushing each other to try and get themselves into a better position."I think that is Peeves," whispered George, screwing his eyes up as he tried to concentrate on the sound of the voice."But we heard footsteps," Lee pointed out.Any response that the twins were about to make was quickly forgotten. The shrill voice of Peeves suddenly bellowed from the corridor making all three of them jump back from the door."STUDENTS OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!""How did he know?" Fred swore bitterly, "he didn't even see us.""It's not us he's talking about," admitted George as the sound of hurried footsteps passed by the door, "there some other people out there.""Do you think that'll matter to Filch if he catches us?" asked Lee, "sorry Filch, but Peeves didn't mean us.""Damn," George swore, "I think I can hear Filch talking to Peeves. If he starts checking the classrooms we're dead. This is the only way in or out of this one.""What do we do?" asked Lee urgently."Run for it," replied Fred to the astounded looks from the other two. He looked around the room they were in, "seriously we could do it. This room is the one we have our Charms lessons in which means the one opposite has a short cut through the tapestry at the back of the room…""Right," nodded George, "we used it last week to get down to the Potions class.""Exactly," said Fred, "so we'll end up in the Dungeons and then we just make our way back to Gryffindor Tower from there.""What about Filch?" said Lee, "he'll spot us the moment we leave the room.""Pull your top up to hide your head," George dragged his t-shirt up over his head so that only his nose was poking out."Fair enough," shrugged Lee as Fred and he followed suit, "but he'll still chase us.""So what?" asked Fred dismissively, "if we can't out run Filch then we deserve to be put in detention.""Ready?" George looked back at the other two with his hand on the handle. All three looked very peculiar with their tops pulled up over their heads, especially as they bobbed up and down on the balls of their feet as they prepared to break into a run. "One…""Two…" mouthed Fred and Lee in unison"Three," George pushed open the door and immediately flung a hand out to reach for the handle opposite."Hey!" barked Filch as the three boys shot across the corridor in a blur.George led the way as he vaulted athletically over the teacher's desk as the head of the room and pushed through a large tapestry depicting some important battle. Behind the tapestry was a tight claustrophobic staircase that led spiralling down. The boys kept their hands pressed against the sides of the walls as they ran down the steps, a couple of times they stumbled in the dark but any thought of slowing down evaporated as they heard Filch pushing the tapestry to one side."Thought I didn't know about this secret stairway did you?" he voice echoed down from above, "I'll have you kicked out for this."Finally George burst through another tapestry at the bottom of the stairwell in another corridor, without even waiting to get his bearings he shot off down the hallway. Fred did likewise, only momentarily pausing to see where his brother had gone after leaving the hidden passageway. Lee was last to exit into the dark dungeon corridor, he pulled his wand from his pocket and fired a spell at the stone floor in front of the tapestry before racing after the twins.The boys turned down one corridor, then another, slaloming left and right in the dark tunnels. After two years of exploring the castle the twins had not only built up an extensive knowledge of the network of secret tunnels and passageways that were strewn about the school but also which ones Filch didn't know about.George stopped to catch his breath in one hidden corridor that could only be entered if the correct enchantment was used to open it. Since Filch was a Squib it was definitely a safe place for them to rest."I… think… we… lost him," gasped Fred leaning his back against the wall and sliding down onto the floor."He… can't half… shift it… for an old man," admitted Lee doubled over at the waist."What was that spell you cast?" asked Fred when he finally got his breath back."Shoe Sticking Spell," explained Lee, still taking large gulps of air, "I figured it might slow him down a bit.""Good thinking," said George appreciatively, "although I would have gone with an Ice Sheen Charm, that would have guaranteed to make him fall over.""He probably would have skidded and broken his leg if I'd used that.""And your point is?""Is it too late to go back?" Lee wondered.

The next day at breakfast, the twins and Lee were lost in such deep conversation about how they planned to get past the three headed dog on the third floor, that they almost didn't notice Angelina and Alicia slip into seats opposite them."I suppose we could ask Hagrid, he'd know where to get some," said Lee thoughtfully."Get some what?" asked Alicia, dolling out some bacon onto her plate before offering them to Angelina."Large bones… ow," Lee rubbed his ankle that had just been kicked by George under the table."What do you need large bones for?" said Angelina adding scrambled egg to her plate, before reaching for some orange juice."Because small ones just won't do," countered Fred waving his fork in her direction."And why won't they do?""Because they are too small.""Too small for what?" clarified Angelina."To be called large bones," stated Fred."You three are so weird," sighed Angelina shaking her head as she mentally reminded herself to refrain from ever expecting a serious answer from the twin."Hey," complained Lee pointing at the twins, "I'm not as weird as them.""Nobody is as weird as them," agreed Alicia.Before either of the twins could come up with an objection, a swarm of owls flew into the Great Hall bringing with them the morning post. Most people's eyes were drawn to one particular elongated package which had to be carried by six large screech owls. Eventually the birds managed to lower the parcel in front of a student sitting further down the line of Gryffindor's table. The group of third years craned their neck to try and see who it was who'd received the item, but since practically everyone else on the table was doing the same it was next to impossible to work out who the recipient was.It only became clear a few moments later when a rather excited looking Harry Potter scurried passed where they were seated, carrying the long brown package. The twin's younger brother, Ron, was following close behind him."It must be his 'you-know-what'," said Alicia looking knowingly at the three boys and nodding."Ah yes, the 'you-know-what," agreed George tapping his nose, he paused for a moment before adding, "and that is…?""His…" Angelina leaned close and mouthed the word 'broom'."It's an odd shape for a balloon," frowned Lee leaning back and watching the retreating form of Harry."Not balloon," scolded Angelina, lowering her voice into a whisper, "his broom.""Oh…that's makes more sense," nodded Lee."I take it back," said Alicia, "you are definitely as weird as them.""I wonder what he got," said George thoughtfully, "probably a Cleansweep Seven.""We'll find out later on tonight," admitted Angelina conversationally, "Woods' taking him out to the pitch to explain the rules and see if he is as good as McGonagall says. I'm sure he'll tell us all about it.""Yeah, whether we want to hear about it or not," added Fred, picking up a letter from the pile that had been dropped in front of the group. In all the excitement over Harry Potter's new broom they'd almost forgotten that they'd received their own post."Brilliant, mum says you can visit over Christmas if you want," exclaimed Alicia as she read from her letter."Really? That's nice of her," admitted George, "are you sure they'll be room for all of us?""Not you, I meant Angelina," Alicia clarified."What? You mean Angelina said we could visit over Christmas? Thanks Angelina," beamed Fred."You two have got to be the biggest idiots I have ever met," sighed Alicia rubbing the bridge of her nose."Come on Alicia," said Angelina picking up her plate of food, "there's some space further down. At least we'll be able to eat breakfast without any moronic comments coming our way."The two girls grabbed their letters and stuffed them into their pockets before flouncing off to a more peaceful section of the table, which realistically could have been anywhere else."They can be so touchy sometimes," said George shaking his head. He tore open one of the two letters the twins had received and passed the other to his brother, "ah, it's from mum. The usual stuff really, 'hope we're behaving ourselves', 'had two letters from McGonagall about our conduct', 'found a toilet seat hidden under Ginny's bed', wants to know if we know anything about that last one. Pretty much the same old thing, well apart from the toilet seat. What about you? Who's that one from?"Fred didn't answer him straight away; instead he was reading the other letter intensely with a frown etched onto his face. Finally he looked up from the parchment to see his brother and Lee staring at him expectantly."Good letter was it?" asked Lee, nodding towards the paper in Fred's hand."It's from Enoch," explained Fred, "he says he's in trouble.""What's new?" shrugged George."That's what I first thought," admitted Fred handing the letter over to his brother, "but read down further, it says we could be in trouble too."Hiya Lads,Enoch here, writing you a quick letter to tell you to keep you eyes out for anything suspicious. I've been trekking through South American for a while now, and every now and then I would get the unmistakeable feeling that I was being watched, and a number of times I thought I actually saw someone following me. At first I put it down to me just being paranoid but it turns out I was right.Some associates and I arranged a little excursion deep into the rainforests to investigate a lost temple from an ancient civilisation. Anyway I was investigating some old ruins; they were supposed to be safe so my guide and the rest of the group I was with in stayed back at the camp. So I'm wondering through these ancient ruins, minding my own business and next thing I know I'm being attacked by someone.Whoever this guy was, he was good; only just managed to survive the first attack. I ended up having to barricade myself into a small chamber in the ruins. I was safe enough inside but I could hear him shouting at me to come out and face him like a man. (A bit of a cheek seeing as he tried to ambush me.)Anyway, this is the bit that concerns you, luckily for me the ruins were made of stone which had natural magical resistance. That frustrated him somewhat as no matter what he tried he couldn't get to me, unfortunately I couldn't get out but all I really had to do was wait for the rest of the camp to wonder where I had got to and come looking for me. So to try and get me to leave, he started telling me what he was going to do if I didn't get out which included saying he'd be forced to move onto his secondary targets; you two. Normally I would have put this down to desperation on his part, but what concerns me is that he actually referred to you by your names.Let's face it, even without Dumbledore, Hogwarts is probably the safest place in the world to be, but keep your eyes and ears open for anything weird happening in your neck of the woods… well weirder than normal anyway. I'm going to try and investigate things over here. It was probably just a lot of hot air from the guy trying to get me into the open but just on the off chance it wasn't – be careful.Hi to the rest of the family and all my old students,Enoch."What do you think?" asked Fred as George passed the letter over to Lee for him to read."I agree with Enoch, it's probably nothing," shrugged George."Yeah but he knew our names," Fred pointed out."So? Who hasn't heard of the famous Weasley twins?" replied George puffing his chest out. He exhaled out a lungful of air and adopted a slightly more serious tone, "look, if anyone looked into Enoch's family history then they'd easily come up with any one of our names. He probably could have just as easily said Charlie or Percy.""True I guess," agreed Fred, "still, I hope Enoch's okay.""Ah he'll be fine," said George dismissively, "you know what he is like, always getting into trouble but manages to get away with it every time.""Now that sounds familiar," said Lee."Yeah Lee," agreed George nodding, "you do manage to get away with a lot of things."****"Did Oliver tell you to wait up for him as well?" asked George flopping into a squashy armchair by the fire."Yeah," nodded Angelina, looking up at the clock in the Common Room. It was quite late, the sun had since disappeared over the horizon and the only occupants of the room were the members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. The fire had died down, now leaving only a smouldering pile of embers which occasionally threw up a spark or two."Where is he anyway?" asked Alicia stretching her legs out so her feet rested on the table in front of her."I saw him just before seven," Fred stifled a yawn against the back of his hand, "he was heading down to the Quidditch pitch to meet Potter.""I forgot about that," said Katie scooting down into her seat and getting comfy, "I wonder if he is any good.""Well obviously he is," George frowned as he looked at her, "why else would he have been made Quidditch Captain?""Not Oliver you idiot, I meant Potter," muttered Katie, she looked sideways at Angelina, "are they always like this?""For as long as I've known them," admitted Angelina sympathetically, "you'll either get use to them or end up beating them to death with their own shoes.""So how long did it take you to get use to them?" wondered Katie looking at her team-mate."Who says I'm used to them?" asked Angelina flashing an evil smile.As Fred and George shuffled their feet back under their chairs, just in case, the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open allowing Oliver and Harry to enter Gryffindor House. They were carrying their brooms slung over their shoulder and both seemed to be pretty pleased with themselves."Hiya Oliver. Harry," the group greeted new arrivals in turn. The girls sat forward a bit to show they were ready to hear what Oliver had to say to them. Katie who, as a new member of the squad, was especially eager to appear attentive looked like she was sitting in class. Fred and George, on the other hand, remained steadfastly slouched in their chairs, which to be fair also meant that they too looked the same way they did in class."Hello guys," said Oliver while Harry acknowledged the group with a nervous smile. "Everyone this is our new Seeker Harry, Harry this is the rest of the team. I think I'm right in saying you already know the twins.""Yeah," nodded Harry, smiling in relief at the two familiar friendly faces, "hi guys.""And these three are our Chasers," said Oliver pointing at the girls. "That's Angelina, Alicia and Katie; she's new this year like you.""Hey," Harry waved awkwardly at the girls, well aware that their three sets of eyes had flickered up towards the scar on his head."Anyway," said Oliver as the girls continued to stare expectantly at the new Seeker, "I've decided on three practice sessions this year instead of the normal two; Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.""Three practice sessions?" asked George looking annoyed as he finally sat forward."I know," Oliver nodded sympathetically, "originally I planned to have five but I just couldn't manage to book the pitch for all of them. Maybe next year though.""Oh good," muttered Fred, "that'll be something to look forward to. Why don't you add some morning practice sessions in too while you are at it?""That's exactly what I thought," beamed Oliver looking thoroughly pleased since he'd initially thought the team might complain about too many practice sessions. He mentally reprimanded himself for ever doubting the team's commitment, "anyway, that'll have to wait until next year, although I'll try and see about those morning sessions. This year we'll be concentrating on the basic skills for the first few weeks before we start practicing some of the new formations I've been playing about with over the summer.""Over the summer?" asked Alicia raising her eyebrows, as George punched his brother in the arm, "don't you ever take a rest from Quidditch?""Why would I do that?" replied Oliver clearly confused."You really do treat Quidditch as if it's a matter of life and death," Angelina counselled carefully."Merlin's Beard no," said Oliver shaking his head dismissively, "it's much more important than that.""With a capital 'K'," muttered Fred under his breath."Well unless I am needed for anything I'm going to head off to bed," said Harry politely, "nice to meet you all."He left the Common Room under a hail of 'goodnights' and headed off the spiral staircase to the boys' dormitories. The team watched him disappear from sight and as soon as they felt he'd dropped out of earshot the rest of the team turned to Oliver."So, is he as good as McGonagall said?" asked Angelina eagerly leaning forward."Better," grinned Oliver almost looking giddy, "it was too dark to try out with the Snitch, but he caught every one of those gloff balls I threw for him, didn't miss a single one.""What's a gloff ball?" asked Fred."One of these," said Oliver taking a golf ball out of his pocket and handing it to the Beater, "it's some weird game muggles play.""Not bad," said Fred examining the golf ball, "these would be pretty hard to spot, but catching a ball is easier than catching a Snitch.""Yeah I know," agreed Oliver solemnly, "but it was only his second time on a broom and he flew like he'd been doing it all his life. I bet he'll be really good by the time he learns the game properly, maybe even better than your brother.""Percy is useless on a broom," admitted George."Well Quidditch skills not always guaranteed to run in a family," replied Oliver sympathetically, his natural immunity to sarcasm working over time as it generally did around the twins."A good Seeker," said Angelina wistfully, "that's all we were missing last year, I think we have a chance of walking away with the Quidditch Cup this time.""We had a good chance of walking away with it last year," said Fred, "but Filch caught us and made us return it to the trophy room.""We'll call that plan B then shall we?" said Alicia stretching out and yawning."Actually I think it's plan C at this point," George corrected her, "I think we all agreed that plan B involved poisoning the other team so they couldn't compete.""I thought plan B was to wedge something into each of the hoops so no one could score," Fred added."No, that was plan D," George pointed out."Did the rest of us miss the day that these plans were thought up?" asked Angelina looking between the two boys."It was decided at the last team meeting," Fred informed her"There was a team meeting?" piped up Oliver looking concerned, "I haven't called a team meeting this year.""Well it wasn't so much a team meeting as it was me and George talking the other day at breakfast.""Lucky for us then," admitted Angelina, "for a moment there I thought I'd missed something important.""Hey, one of these games we'll put one of our plans into action and then you won't be mocking us about them," countered Fred."No, we'll probably be too busy laughing as you… I don't know… pull Mrs Norris from inside your top and throw her at the opposing 'Keeper," Katie snorted sarcastically."That's actually not bad," said George looking impressed, "we'll call that one," at this point he did a bit of mental calculation, "plan J, I think that's about right."

The third years' timetables were noticeably fuller this year owing to the fact that they had to choose a minimum of two additional subjects to study. While most of the more sensible students had chosen subjects based on a rough idea of possible career paths they would like to take, the twins, and by extension Lee, had chosen Muggle Studies and Divination due to the fact that they were believed to be the easier ones to pass."Now class," said Professor Burbage. She began passing out parchments to the students, "here are your essays from last week, and while on the whole the standard of the work was high I have to regretfully inform some of you that Muggles do not use washing machines to bathe in.""Are you one hundred percent sure on that?" asked Fred frowning at his parchment which contained a lot more red ink then he thought was appropriate."Yes, I am very sure of that," replied Burbage kindly."Even though I've drawn a picture to show it is possible," said Fred holding up his homework."While many of your suggestions on what items can be found in a Muggle home were technically possible," Burbage responded diplomatically, "for that picture to be accurate the washing machine would have to be as tall as the room.""But if it was as tall as the room could a Muggle use it to take a bath in?" asked Fred."Yes.""Excellent," beamed Fred offering his parchment up for a corrected mark."Although the Muggle would probably die," finished Burbage. There was an awkward pause."But that's still a yes, right?" asked Fred breaking the silence, his parchment still being held out."Fine," sighed Burbage taking the parchment from him and waving her wand at it to change the mark, "congratulations, although you still failed.""I don't know," said Fred examining his work, "give me a few more minutes and I could probably argue a few extra marks.""While Mister Weasley fights the inevitable, I'll draw the attention of the rest of you to the front of the class," Burbage pointed her wand at the windows, making the shutters close before flipping a switch on an ancient looking projector that whirled into life in a fit of clicking."We'll be moving away from household items for the time being," explained Burbage as a white light formed on a screen at the head of the room, "and moving onto different forms of transport that Muggles use. Can anyone tell me what this is?"Professor Burbage tapped the projector with her wand and with a click the white light was replaced by a picture of a car. Several hands in the class went up. She nodded towards George."It's a car," he answered confidently, seeing as his father owned one this wasn't to be unexpected that he'd get it right."Well done," smiled Burbage, "one point to Gryffindor, from talking to the other teachers I believe that puts your total so far this year to minus fourteen.""Actually it's minus nineteen," corrected George unashamedly, "we had double Potions this morning.""Ah," nodded Burbage tapping the projector once again, "and what about this one?"This time fewer hands went up."Yes, Mr Wigglemore?""It's an aeroplant," said a Hufflepuff student confidently."Close but it's plane, aeroplane," explained Burbage tapping the projector again. An image of a helicopter appeared in view, "and this one.""Ooo I know this one," said Fred raising his hand. While there were a number of other hands up, Burbage noted that his was the only one that belonged to someone from a purely wizarding background. She nodded in Fred's direction, "it's a Whirly-Bird Thing.""Er…no, it's a called a Helicopter," corrected Burbage, as there was a faint rippling of giggles from the class."That's what dad always called them," Fred complained under his breath as Lee nudged him with his elbow.The lesson continued with the class copying notes from the board about different types of transport that the average muggle would use in their day to day life. Although they were only taking the subject for the first time in their third year, the twins, along with most others who took the class found that it was actually quite enjoyable due to the relaxed nature in which it was taught.While most people who didn't take the class thought it might be extremely boring since there were no spells to learn, no charms to conjure, and no potions to master, there was one additional thing missing that definitely made up for it; no Slytherin students. It was something that the whole class had noted upon on their first day, although since Burbage never said anything about it none of the students decided to bring up the matter. Well, none of the polite ones did anyway."So what's the story with no Slytherin students?" asked George once he'd finished copying the notes down."Salazar Slytherin was well know for his love of pure-bloods," explained Burbage as the rest of the class listened intently whilst trying to appear to be concentrating on copying the information on the board, "and needless to say most of those that are put into Slytherin buy into that pure-blood nonsense that very few, if any, ever decide that Muggle society is worth even acknowledging let alone knowing about. If fact in all my time teaching here, I don't think I have ever had a single Slytherin student.""You aren't missing much," said George grinning cheekily."Yes, well, I can't really comment on that myself," said Burbage the corner of her mouth creasing slightly upward before she managed to rein it back under her control.The class continued to copy the notes until it soon became apparent that everyone had finished, and were either patiently sitting still, talking quietly to their neighbour or, in the case of the twins, taking it in turns to flick each other behind the ear while the other wasn't looking."Excellent," Burbage said once she was happy that the notes had been copied. She broke into a smile and walked to the side of the room where a store cupboard was located, "now I have a little treat for you all. I've managed to get my hands on a few modes of transport used by muggles for you to try out.""We're going to drive cars?" asked one excited student as everyone looked at each other."Don't be such a twonk Merrick," said George rolling his eyes, "you could never get a car inside that store cupboard; now one of them motorbikes, that would definitely fit.""I'm sorry to disappoint you two," said Burbage using her wand to float two large boxes back into the room, "but we don't cover the practical aspect of cars or motorbikes in this class. However, we are going to be trying out these."Burbage had opened both boxes and lifted up two strange looking objects. In her left hand she held a pair of odd looking boots and in her right hand she held a wooden board. Both the boots and the board had four wheels attached to each of them."These," said Burbage jingling the boots in her left hand, "are called roller-skates and this is a skateboard. Most muggle children have used one or the other at some point.""Trust muggles to take something simple like a shoe and make it weird," said Lee examining one of the roller-skates that Burbage had just put down in front of him as she handed out the items."A shoe? What about this thing? " asked Fred holding up his skateboard and shaking his head, "they went and slapped some wheels on a piece of wood.""Now can I ask everyone to please help push the desks to the side of the room to give you a little space? No one is to start using the roller-skates or skateboards until I have handed out the appropriate safety equipment."****"It's broken," complained Lee holding a bloody hanky to his nose."It's not broken," countered Fred walking along side him."It's my nose," replied Lee wincing slightly, "I know if it's broken or not and I'm telling you it's broken.""Your nose?" asked George walking next to them cradling his left arm, "what about my arm?""What about your arm?" snapped Lee, "it's your fault my nose is like this.""How do you figured that?""Lets see," said Lee sarcastically, "if you hadn't grabbed by arm when you were falling over, then you wouldn't have pulled me down, and I wouldn't have smacked my nose on the ground.""I didn't grab you on purpose," argued George, "it was just instinct. Anyway it was all really Fred's fault.""Er… how exactly?" retorted Fred, the only one of the trio to be unharmed."Burbage told us not to start using those things until she'd given out the safety equipment," explained George as they approached the Infirmary doors, "and before she did, you started whizzing around the room like an idiot.""And how is me whizzing around like an idiot have anything to do with you falling over?""Because if you hadn't done it then I wouldn't have tried mine out without the safety equipment either, and then I wouldn't have fallen over and I wouldn't have pulled Lee down with me.""So that's my fault is it?" argued Fred pushing the door open and holding it for the other two, "if I jumped off our broom shed would you copy me?""I did," countered George, "remember? I landed on top of you and skinned my knee.""Oh yeah," said Fred letting the door swing shut behind them, "I forgot about that, oh well I guess it must be my fault. Sorry guys.""What happened now?" asked Madame Pomfrey looking up from her desk."Oh, well Lee here thinks he has a broken nose and George, sorry George," Fred apologised for slapping his brother on his injured arm, "has done something to his arm. And apparently it's my entire fault.""Were you fighting?" asked Pomfrey disapprovingly."No. Well actually we were, but that was only about whose fault it was," explained Fred; the look of confusion on the school's nurse's face was enough to convince him to clarify the story. "It happened in our Muggles Studies lesson.""That Charity Burbage," Pomfrey clucked reproachfully, "she's always messing around with some muggle invention, what was it this time? Sporkscrews? Chainclaws? She's not still trying to get something electic to work is she?" asked the woman, carefully trying to pronounce the unfamiliar muggle words."Skateboard actually," said George as Pomfrey undid the sleeve on his shirt and rolled it up."I should have known," said Pomfrey examining his arm, "every year I get a constant flow of students through here thanks to that lesson, only Care of Magical Creatures and Quidditch account for more injuries.""Wow, if I'd known that…" Fred looked thoughtful for a moment, "I'd probably still have signed up for it.""Typical boys," muttered Pomfrey applying some ointment to a cloth and wrapping it around George's arm. "It's not broken, probably badly sprained; this should take the sting out of it somewhat. Now lets look at your nose. Ah yes, definitely broken.""Ha!" beamed Lee, looking across at George "told you so. Ow.""Well if you do insist on moving around," counselled Pomfrey, she took her wand out and pointed at his face, "now keep still.""Ahh that's better," said Lee prodding the end of his nose with a finger once it had been fixed."Here," said Pomfrey handing him a cloth, and pointing him towards a basin with a mirror above it, "go and clean that blood off your face.""It'll take more then a damn cloth to improve that face," grinned Fred, causing Lee to flash him a look of annoyance. Pomfrey frowned as she tried to spot exactly what was wrong with him. She began by examining his head, pushing his hair out of the way to see if there were any cuts on his scalp. Once it became clear that his skull was okay, she moved onto other parts of his body until she eventual gave up with a snort of frustration."Okay," Pomfrey frowned with her hands on her hips, "what's wrong with you?""Oh nothing," admitted Fred cheerfully, "Professor Burbage said someone should help these two down to the Hospital Wing. I volunteered.""You could have told me sooner," complained Pomfrey shaking her head. She turned to look at George, "keep that cloth on over your arm for the next hour or so and it should be right as rain. As for you Mr Jordan, aside from a little tenderness you should be just fine. Back off to class the both of you.""How come he's completely fine and I have to have this on for an hour?" wondered George as the three boys left the Hospital Wing."You'd rather you had a broken arm?" asked Lee prodding his nose gingerly with his finger."No," admitted George shrugging, "I'm just saying it just seems a bit unfair if you ask me.""Unfair? It was your fault, remember?" complained Lee."I thought we established it was Fred's fault.""Shh," said Lee holding his hand up just as Fred was about to counter with a witty retort that involved the words 'up' and 'shut' arranged in a suitable order.Up ahead they could hear the unmistakeable muttering of Filch. Not wanting to have to explain why they were out of class, the three boys decided it would be easier to hide in one of the side alcoves until the caretaker had gone.They pressed their backs against the wall as Filch appeared at the end of the corridor; George poked his head out slightly to see if he would proceed down the hallway."Is he coming?" whispered Lee."No," advised George causing the other two to let out a relieved sigh, "he just carried on across the corridor, must be going done to his office. There was something slightly worrying though.""What?""He seemed happy.""Happy?" frowned Lee, "he's only happy when he has just put someone into detention, or when he is about to put someone into detention, or when he is supervising detention… he really likes detention doesn't he?""Yeah, I heard he once applied for a job as a guard in Azkaban but they decided to stick with the Dementors as they were more humane.""I wonder what has him so giddy," said Fred thoughtfully."There's only one way to find out," said Lee smiling."Hold Mrs Norris for ransom until he tells us?" queried George."Er… yes," replied Lee kindly, "or we could just follow him and find out.""Ah, keeping it simple," nodded George, "I like it."The three boys carefully but quickly crept down the corridor and turned left following the route that Filch had. It brought them out to the main stairwell with its constantly change staircases. Looking over the banister Fred managed to catch a glimpse of the caretaker on one of the lower steps."He must be heading back to his office," concluded George leaning over the rail."Okay there's a shortcut behind the statue of McGummry the Ever-Confused," said Fred having a quick mental check of all of the routes they'd uncovered in the last two years, "it should bring us out just past his office.""Good thinking," said Lee as the three boys backtracked quickly down the corridor to find the statue, "I'm always amazed that despite knowing all these shortcuts, we are always a bit late for our classes.""It's because of all the shortcuts that we decide we have plenty of time to get to lessons," shrugged George, "if we didn't know about them I'm pretty sure we'd be on time."They were soon standing in front of the large statue of a man scratching his head with one hand and holding a book open with the other. George took out his wand and tapped one of the stone legs three times with the end of it causing the whole sculpture to revolve forward revealing a hidden passageway behind it.Fred led the way, quickly followed by Lee with George stepping through last and closing the doorway after him. Lighting their wands they navigated the tight meandering turns and steps until they were down on the ground floor near Filch's office. Fred pushed the door open a slight crack to let in a thin stream of light from the corridor. He pressed his eye up against the opening to see if the coast was clear, before pushing the doorway open to allow them to leave.Fred led the creeping procession along the hallway; the open door of Filch's office could be seen ahead, the occasional flicker of a shadow from inside confirmed that there was someone inside. As the three boys got closer they could hear the caretaker's voice emanating from the room. Getting as close to the door as they dared the three boys listened in."I can't believe it is finally here Mrs Norris," said Filch from inside the room, "a brand new Secrecy Sensor. Top of the line this one is too, and just at the right time as well. Those third years are having their first Hogsmeade weekend this week and I bet they'll bring back a whole bunch of things from Zonko's, especially those Weasley boys. But I'll be waiting. Oh yes, one sweep of this and I bet they'll have enough on them to be shackled…"George nodded to the other two to head back towards the hidden short cut where they could safely talk without the possibility of being overheard by anyone."I completely forgot about Hogsmeade this weekend," admitted Fred once they were back in the quite confines of the secret passageway"Really?" asked Lee frowning in the dark, "because that's all anyone has been on about.""It's because for everyone else it's their first time in Hogsmeade," said George thoughtfully, "we've been going about once a month since the first year so it's hardly something new for us.""I bet Filch has been planning this since the first year," concluded Fred shaking his head."More than likely," agreed Lee, "I reckon he had all his hopes on catching you two bringing in a whole bunch of banned items so you'd be expelled straight away.""Er… who was it that brought a Banshee Ball back last time?" Fred reminded his friend."That would be you," Lee answered, "I brought back the Blasting Jacks and those weren't banned at the time, although they were shortly after.""Oh yeah," nodded Fred, "I still have the scars.""Poor Filch is going to be so disappointed when he finds nothing on us," sighed George sympathetically."We really can't do that to our favourite caretaker can we?" asked Fred in a worried tone."Of course not," agreed George, "we'll have to think up something extra special for him to find on us.""Like a Dungbomb?" ventured Lee."No," said Fred shaking his head, "we're gonna need something a little bigger then a Dungbomb for Filch.""So… two Dungbombs?""Ah Lee," said George patting his friend on the shoulder, "this is one of those moments that requires something I like to refer to as a 'Fred and George Special Plan'.""Great," sighed Lee, "I'm going to end up back in the Hospital Wing again, aren't I?"

"Hogsmeade is not a right, it is a privilege," stated McGonagall firmly. She was addressing the third years in front of the school on a cold and blustery autumn morning. Most of them had wrapped themselves up with various levels of clothing topped off with warm woollen hats. The older students had already left to go to the village but since it would be the first official time that the third years were allowed off of school grounds, the Deputy Headmistress through it necessary to give them a talk about their behaviour."When you are in Hogsmeade you are representatives of Hogwarts," she informed them with her arms grasped behind her back, "as such, you should behave as you do within in the school. That is to say, how you are suppose to behave in school." She clarified once she reminded herself that she was talking to a group that contained Fred and George."Over the years," she continued, "this school has had a very close relationship with the village of Hogsmeade and we would like to continue to be welcome there. So there will be no misbehaving," her eyes fell on the twins for this portion of the talk, "no mischief, no pranks, no running amuck, basically do not be doing anything in Hogsmeade that you wouldn't want to be caught doing in Hogwarts. Now, if you would all follow me."McGonagall pulled a green tartan hat over her hair making sure it kept her ears warm and then headed off in the direction the older students had gone previously. The group of third years fell into line behind her, chatting excitedly to each other as they made their way to the only completely non-muggle village in Great Britain."I don't know why she was looking at us when she said that," complained Fred as he George and Lee brought up the rear of the group."I know," added George, "we've been to Hogsmeade plenty of times and we've never got into any trouble.""Well, there was that stuff last year with Enoch and those Sect of Kai guys," admitted Lee."Oh we were nearly killed but we've nearly been killed plenty of times at Hogwarts so it's not as if we were doing anything different," countered Fred."You know, in some weird way that actually makes sense," said Lee."What's Montague going on about now?" muttered George as the voice of one of the Slytherins' filtered back to them."Of course I'm surprised that more Slytherins haven't moved to Hogsmeade," commented Montague "my family moved there generations ago and haven't looked back.""Are there really no muggles at all?" asked one of the Slytherin girls walking along side him."Well, that's not strictly true I suppose," admitted Montague, "what I mean to say is that in Hogsmeade we don't have to hide the truth from the muggles. There are a few in the village that have married wizards or witches so there is the odd muggle about the place; I suppose someone has to keep the streets clean. Unfortunately it didn't turn into a place only for purebloods as my ancestors had initially hoped when they moved there but I suppose it's the best that can be managed under the circumstances.""'The best that can be managed under the circumstances.' Can you believe that idiot?" said Lee shaking his head."He is a Slytherin," said George as a way of explanation, "so it's hardly his fault he is an idiot, he was born that way.""Have you got something to say about Slytherins?" asked Montague who'd clearly heard George's comment."I have plenty of things to say about them," admitted George shrugging."Such as?" Montague had stopped, as had his group of hangers-on."Well for a start…"Before he could finish his sentence, McGonagall was already striding towards them with a stern look on her face. It was as though she had a sixth sense when it came to trouble brewing. She quickly ushered the three Gryffindor students towards the front of the procession, much to their annoyance seeing as they were now firmly under her watchful eye.The students finally made in into Hogsmeade and the majority of them quickly found themselves excitedly rushing between the various shop windows trying to work out which one to go into first. Fred, George and Lee, however, confidently strode towards the Three Broomsticks, pushed open the door and stepped into the warm building."What are you doing here?" asked Madam Rosmerta. She'd spotted them the moment they'd entered the bar and had quickly come from behind the counter to intercept them. She kept her voice low and kept looking over into one corner of the pub. "You picked the wrong day for this, a few of your teachers are over there. They haven't spotted you so you'd better sneak back out.""Oh it's okay," said George smiling waving towards the group of teachers, "we're third years now, so we're allowed in to Hogsmeade officially. Hiya Hagrid.""Oh," said Madam Rosmerta, "third years already? My my, time as certainly flown. The usual then?""Yep three Fire Whiskeys," nodded Fred, "and make them large ones.""Three Butterbeers it is," replied Madam Rosmerta ruffling Fred's hair. She pointed towards an empty table, "I'll bring them over to you.""So what's this great plan for Filch then?" asked Lee once the drinks had been brought over. He took a large gulp of the warm buttery liquid and let out a satisfied sigh."Ah," said George excitedly leaning in to the table. He pulled out a piece of parchment from his pocket and slapped it down on the table. "Check this out.""It looks like a map," said Lee examining the paper, "a badly drawn map.""Hey," complained George snatching up the parchment, "I worked all night on this.""All night?""Okay I scribbled it out before breakfast.""So what's there then?" asked Lee point at a bold looking 'x' drawn onto the page, "some hidden treasure?""That's what Filch will think," beamed George, "and he'll no doubt go looking for it.""And that's your great plan is it?" Lee said sceptically, "how can Filch finding a bunch of hidden treasure be described as a great plan?""Because there won't be any treasure there.""Obviously, since you two are as skint as I am," shrugged Lee, "so we send Filch on a wild goose chase then?""No, for a start I wouldn't have a clue where we would get any geese from," admitted Fred scratching his chin thoughtfully."What we are going to do is get Filch to follow this map which will lead into a nasty little surprise for him," explained George ignoring his twin."…and plus I'm not sure how exactly we'd get Filch to chase them anyway.""A nasty surprise?" grinned Lee."…maybe if they had some Galleons on them, but how would we stick them onto geese in the first place?""I was thinking something along the lines of a great big pit filled with dungbombs, stinkpellets, odourpatches," said George getting a look of approval from Lee."…I suppose we could use a Sticking Charm but it's not as if we have a whole bunch of Galleons lying around is it?""You don't think it'll be going a bit far?" asked Lee uncertainly, "he'll probably get pretty mad if he fell into that.""Think of it this way," said George leaning back in his seat, "if Filch didn't go snooping around, sticking his nose where it wasn't wanted then he wouldn't end up in the Pit of Stench.""Pit of Stench?""It's what I called it," said George proudly, "I named it after Fred's armpit.""Unless we make up some fake Galle… hey!" Fred complained finally catching up on the conversation, "left armpit or right armpit?""Right armpit.""Fair enough," admitted Fred after thinking about this for a few moments.While the rest of the students in Hogsmeade were enjoying the various shops that the village had to offer, Lee and the twins were busying hiking though a wooded area on the outskirts. They'd previously stopped by Zonko's Joke Shop and picked up enough smell related trickery to fill a bag, which was being carefully carried by George."You could have drawn somewhere easy to get to," said Lee as he stumbled slightly, reaching a hand out to steady himself on a tree."When Filch finds the map in my pocket it has to be believable otherwise he won't go for it," explained George, "besides the harder it is to get to, the less chance of someone stumbling onto us while we are digging the pit. This'll do."The three boys had stopped just at the edge of a small clearing in the wooded area covered in brown leaves."Er… this is probably a stupid question," said Lee looking around the area, "but did anyone bring any shovels?""You call yourself a wizard do you?" scoffed Fred taking out his wand."Work away," said Lee folding his arms and nodding towards the clearing."Er…," the look of smugness on Fred's face gradually gave way to a frown, "…oh.""Exactly, we all have wands but we don't actually know a spell for digging, do we?" Lee pointed out."I'm sure we can come up with something," said George scratching his head."How about…" Fred pointed his wand at a patch of the ground, "Wingardium Leviosa!"A lone leaf bobbed uncertainly up off the ground."Excellent," congratulated Lee, "we'll be done just in time for our N.E..""Yeah," agreed George as the two of them watched Fred gradually navigate the leaf to the edge of the clearing with a look of pure concentration etched onto his face, "any ideas what we could use to dig a hole?""Yeah," nodded Lee, "a shovel.""I meant what spell," said George rolling his eyes."There," said Fred looking somewhat satisfied as he guided the leaf down onto the ground, "one down.""What about a Summoning Charm?" asked Lee as he and George ignored Fred who was now working on moving a second leaf out of the way, "we could use it to pull the mud out of the ground.""I suppose that could work," said George thoughtfully scratching his chin, "although I've never actually tried using that spell.""What's to learn?" shrugged Lee, "as far as I can tell you just point the wand at what you want and go 'Accio'.""You know, I'll be amazed if you don't end up teaching at Hogwarts," George admitted dryly."That's two," Fred decided to inform the other two before starting work on a third leaf."If you have any better suggestions I'll be glad to hear them," replied Lee curtly."No, anything is better then Fred's plan," said George getting his wand ready, as he tried to picture the last time he'd seen someone cast the spell. He pointed it down at the ground and concentrated. "Accio mud."Nothing happened."Accio mud," Lee tried this time; he added a slight flick of the wand just in case this would make any difference. It didn't."Ac-cio mud," the two boys began to try as many different variations of pronunciation and wand gesticulation as they could."A-ccio mud.""Ac-cio mud.""Wingardium Leviosa.""Accio mud, hey, I think I saw something move a bit there," said George excitedly, "I might be onto something here. Accio mud.""Er… George," some nagging piece of information that had been trying to get Lee attention for the last few minutes finally managed to make itself heard in his brain."Accio mud. See? It's definitely doing something right.""George," said Lee urgently."Accio mud. I think if I just get the wand movement right we'll be laughing.""George, maybe it isn't such a good…""Accio mud!"The world was suddenly full of mud."…idea."The landscape of the clearing had changed somewhat. On the plus side, there was now a sizeable, although not very neat, hole in the centre of the glade. On the down side the mud that up until now had enjoyed a rather happy life occupying the space where the hole appeared now found itself relocated to a new place. Unfortunately the new place also happened to be the same one occupied by Fred, George and Lee."As I was just about to point out," said Lee slowly wiping the mud off his face, "Accio, is a Summoning Charm, and if we managed to get it right we'd be summoning mud towards us.""You couldn't have come up with that a little earlier could you?" wondered George."Okay, let's make the best of a bad situation shall we?" sighed Lee pulling a large lump of dirt out of his hair and fantasising about a nice long bath once he'd got back to Hogwarts.George pulled the bag off his shoulder and upturned the contents into the bottom of the pit. The three boys quickly worked to cover the hole using a number of loose sticks and branches lying about on the ground, before retrieving handfuls of leaves to thrown on top of the creation and disguise it further."There," said Lee smiling as he wiped his hands together, "looks just about perfect.""It could do with one slight finishing touch," admitted Fred, he pointed his wand at a bunch of leaves at his feet, "Wingardium Leviosa.""I can't believe we are related," sighed George as his brother carefully guided a floating leaf on top of the hidden pit."I know what you mean," agreed Fred, "but don't worry, I'm sure one day you'll be as talented as I am."The boys, still covered head to toe in mud, decided to head back towards the school since they very much doubted any of the shop owners would welcome them in with open arms after getting a look at them. Since they were already on the outskirts of the village it didn't take them long to make the journey back to the school gate.As they approached the entrance they could hear a sudden rustling from the bushes to the side. After a few moments of uncertainty the triumphant figure of the school caretaker emerged from the undergrowth."Ha!" Filch smiled malevolently waving his Secrecy Sensor in the air, "I have you now.""Mr Filch," said Fred looking into the undergrowth, where a small seat had been place which had a copy of the Daily Prophet and a few discarded sandwiches along with a box containing a number of items that he knew were all banned in the school, "have you been out here all day?""Didn't think I'd do that did you?" sneered Filch still brandishing his new toy around, "but it's worth it to catch you three in the act of smuggling. Oh I already caught some others coming back from the village but they were small fry compared to catching you.""Smuggling?" frowned Lee."Yes smuggling," snorted Filch, he pulled out a rather hefty looking scroll from his pocket. "This here is a list of every item that has been banned at the school, I know this list of by heart, and if you have anything on this list on you then… why in Merlin's name are you covered in mud?""Don't you follow fashion?" asked George raising an eyebrow. He looked Filch up and down. "I guess not, anyway, it's the latest craze: the mud look.""The mud look? Honestly, you children get worse every year," complained Filch shaking his head."In my day," Fred muttered under his breath."What was that?" snapped Filch."Nothing," replied Fred before giving a few coughs, "just had something in my throat.""Oh, well anyway," said Filch carrying on, "in my day... why are you smirking?""Sore throat," said Lee coughing theatrically "must be something going around.""Oh I see," said Filch narrowing his eyes, "thought you'd try and distract me did you? Make me forget all about the illegal contraband you three are carrying.""We aren't carrying any illegal contraband," sighed George."I'll be the judge of that," snapped Filch, he waved the Secrecy Sensor under their noses, "do you know what this is?""Is it a butterfly catcher?" asked Lee looking at the gold coloured piece of metal that the caretaker held in his hand."Don't be silly, there's no net for a start," Fred pointed out."This is a Secrecy Sensor," stated Filch firmly looking thoroughly impressed with himself."Oh, for when you play hide and seek?" said George jovially, "and is that why you are happy to see us? You want to play a game? With us? Don't you have any friends your own age?""No, I don't want to play a game," snapped Filch, "this is for… wait, what do you mean 'friends my own age', of course I have friends my own age.""It's just we've never really seen…" George started but was cut off by the caretaker."Just because you've never seen them, doesn't mean they don't exist," Filch continued his rant, "I have plenty of friends, dozens, hundreds in fact.""I was just saying…" George tried again."I can't go a single day without getting a whole bunch of owls asking me to meet up with so and so or join someone for a dinner party," stated Filch quickly, "it's amazing that I have any free time to myself whatsoever."There was an embarrassed silence that hung in the air between the caretaker and the three boys. At roughly the same time they all became aware that the Secrecy Sensor was vibrating quite urgently in Filch's hand."Why is it doing that?" asked Lee pointing at the device."Well it's a Secrecy Sensor," said Fred, "it vibrates when it detects someone concealing something or when someone lies. So these multitude of friends that you mentioned…""It's obviously vibrating because you three are concealing something," snapped Filch quickly cutting the boy's sentence short."We aren't" replied Lee. He looked down at his clothes, "well, maybe some more mud but nothing else.""A likely story," said Filch pointing at the Secrecy Sensor, "look, it's vibrating which means you're lying.""It was already vibrating," Lee tried to explain."Then obviously it could sense that you were about to lie," countered Filch."They don't work like that," Fred frowned."Oh and I suppose you know all about Secrecy Sensors do you?" Filch snorted prodding Fred in the chest with the object in question, "have you ever read through the instruction manual?""No, have you?""I don't need to read instructions," snapped Filch, "I know how these work, now stand still while I find the contraband."The three boys patiently waited as Filch passed the Secrecy Sensor over them. Both Fred and Lee's examination went by uneventfully, although the caretaker seemed adamant that his own personal sixth sense for trouble had picked something up and he ended up passing the device repeated over the two of them. It wasn't until he moved onto George that he got the result he was looking for."Aha!" beamed Filch gleefully as the Sensor began to vibrate as he brought it near to one of George's pockets, "turn out that pocket.""There's nothing in there," said George playing along as he pulled the pocket inside out."Your hand," snapped Filch pointing at George, "what did you take out of your pocket?""This?" George held up the parchment with the hastily draw map on it, "it's just a shopping list of stuff that I was suppose to get in Hogsmeade.""Oh is it really?" asked Filch sarcastically, as the Sensor vibrated harder in the presence of George's lie. "Give it here."The caretaker snatched the piece of paper from George's hand and unfolded it, after a few seconds of looking at it his eyes suddenly lit up."A map is it?" he looked the mud covered three boys up and down, "So what did you bury there then?""Nothing," said Fred firmly. The Secrecy Sensor vibrated into life."Ha!" said Filch triumphantly holding up the device, "nothing eh? Not according to this.""Look Mr Filch," George said, suddenly backing away as the caretaker swung the Sensor under his nose, "trust me on this, you don't want to follow that map. It'll just end badly for you.""Badly? End badly? Don't you tell me what to do," snarled Filch, "I'm a member of staff, and you are just students so don't forget who's in charge here. I'll have you expelled this time. You might as well just go and pack now."Filch pushed passed George and headed down the path away from the school. The three boys watched him as he left."He almost looks like he's about to start skipping," commented Lee as the caretaker disappeared around the corner."We always make him so happy," admitted Fred."Well, for a little while at least," added George.****"Another glass of Rosewater Minerva?" asked Madam Rosemerta as she collected the glass from the table."Why not?" smiled McGonagall. The landlady asked Flitwick and Hagrid, who were also sat with the Transfiguration teacher, if they wanted refills as well. The freshly poured drinks were placed on the table just as Filch entered the pub and looked around. He spotted McGonagall and quickly made his way over."Mr Filch," Flitwick greeted the caretaker, "so glad you could join us.""I'm not here to join you," explained Filch gruffly, he flicked his gaze over to McGonagall; "I found this on one of your students.""What is it? Some sort of map?" asked McGonagall wearily looking at the parchment that had just been handed to her."Yes and they've buried something there," stated Filch firmly."Will yer ever give it a rest?" complained Hagrid, "they're jus' kids.""Of course I expected you to be soft on those miscreants but I doubt our Deputy Headmistress fills the same.""Which 'miscreants' are we talking about exactly?" asked McGonagall handing the piece of paper back to Filch. "Not Fred and George Weasley again?""Yes, them again.""Mr Filch," sighed McGonagall, "so far this year alone you have come to me with no less then seventy-two complaints about their behaviour.""Yes…""And each time, you have failed to provide any actual evidence of any wrong doings.""I don't need evidence," snorted Filch, "every time they were definitely up to something, I could feel it in my bones.""I'm sure you did," McGonagall said carefully, "but if we punished every student whom you felt in your bones was up to something then we'd have the whole school in detention.""Yes," nodded Filch failing to see anything wrong with this idea."So unless you have any more proof other then that drawing…""But I will have proof," admitted Filch, "I'm going to follow the map and dig up whatever it is they buried.""And I expect that you want me to come along to witness this evidence?""Of course," agreed Filch, "the last time I came to you with a complaint about those two you said that I had some kind of vendetta against them. This time you'll witness their wrongdoing yourself.""Very well Mr Filch," said McGonagall resignedly. She stood up and grabbed her cloak from behind her chair. She turned to Flitwick and Hagrid, "this shouldn't take too long. I'll be back in a few minutes.""Take yer time," said Hagrid lifting his drink to his lips, "we aren't going anywhere."

Late in October the Hogwarts students were pleasantly woken by the smell of baked pumpkin wafting through the corridors, which in turn had been adorned with Halloween decorations streaming throughout the whole school."No matter how many years I am here, I'll never get tired of this," said Fred inhaling deeply as he, George and Lee made their way down to their Transfiguration class."You really like McGonagall's lessons that much?" asked Lee raising an eyebrow."No, I meant the baked pumpkins," replied Fred taking another intoxicating breath, as they wandered through the door of the class.Early on in their school careers they had learnt that there were only two lessons that you made sure you weren't late for; Transfigurations and Potions. Most of the other teachers were more forgiving than McGonagall and Snape when it came to tardiness; in fact the twins had discovered that Professor Binns didn't even notice if students turned up to his class at all let alone if they were late, something that they used to their full advantage to enjoy a long lie in every Thursday morning."I wonder what we'll be doing today?" said George as the three boys settled into their seats behind Alicia and Angelina."Probably something boring again," complained Alicia, "ever since Hogsmeade she has been so uptight, well more than usual anyway.""You three have a lot to answer for," said Angelina turning around and glaring at the three boys."Us?" said George looking offended. "It's not our fault we keep getting dull stuff.""It's your fault McGonagall is in a bad mood therefore it is your fault that we are having boring lessons.""You don't know it was our fault she is in a bad mood," countered Fred."Let's look at the facts shall we," said Alicia, "one: McGonagall returns to escort the third years back to Hogwarts covered head to toe in some disgusting smelling concoction…""You can't blame her choice of perfume on us," replied Lee folding his arms."Two:" Alicia carried on, ignoring the interruption, "when she gets back she calls you and the Idiot Brothers to her office for the next hour…""Lee Jordan and the Idiot Brothers," mused Lee thoughtfully, "not a bad name for a band.""And three: you lot are put in detention every day for a month. It doesn't take a genius to link everything together."Before either the twins or Lee could come up with a better argument McGonagall had entered the class room and closed the door behind her with a decisive thump. The students immediately stopped talking and faced the front of the room as McGonagall approached her desk."Today we'll be learning about the art of Animagi," McGonagall turned to address her class. She nodded towards Alicia who was holding her hand up, "yes Miss Spinnet?""Will we need our wands for this?""No," there was a slightly rumbling of groans under people's breath with a few pointed looks given in the directions of the twins and Lee. "Please open your books to page four hundred and forty seven and begin reading until the end of the chapter."The class read in silence as they worked their way through the passages. The only sounds came from the occasionally stifling of the odd yawn and the low rustling as a page was turned."Right," said McGonagall once she was satisfied that the majority of people had finished reading the chapter, "who can tell me the difference between an Animagus in their animal form and someone who has been transformed into an animal by a wizard or witch?"A few hands went up, including, surprisingly, Fred's. McGonagall's eyes flickered over his upraised palm."It should be noted that a correct answer will result in a House Point," McGonagall informed them, "but a blatantly silly answer will result in detention."Fred lowered his hand sheepishly."Yes Miss Johnson?" McGonagall nodded towards the Gryffindor student."In their animal form Animagus still completely maintain their human minds," stated Angelina, "while someone who has been transformed into an animal only maintain their minds for a short time and will gradually revert towards the mind of an animal the longer they remained transformed.""Excellent," McGonagall gave her a look of approval, "one point to Gryffindor."The questions continued for most of the rest of the lesson, and while most of them were answered deftly by the class members, Fred and George spent most of their time trying to stifle yawns and watching the large clock on the wall, willing the second hand to tick by faster. Eventually their prayers were answered and the lesson came to an end. The students filtered out excitedly as that evening was the night of the Halloween feast.Although the three boys were now in their third year they couldn't help but still be impressed by the Halloween decorations in the Great Hall. Along the sides of the walls were reams of orange and black ribbons that snaked in and out of the various pictures and portraits that hung the wall, dotted about the room were several large pumpkins that had been carved into different ghoulish faces and charmed to appear lifelike. There was a number of smaller carved pumpkins on the tables themselves, these however hadn't been animated and instead contained candles within them, although since they were magical candles the flames changed colours on occasion to give the room a multicolour hue.The younger students kept looking up uncertainly at the swarm of bats that hung from the walls and ceiling, alternating between screaming and ducking as a cloud of them suddenly dispatched themselves from the wall and flew overhead across the width of the room. It took them a while to get use to the fluttering of the wings and the sudden flicking of the candles as another group of bats took to the air, but after much reassuring from the older students they soon began to relax and would only occasionally flinch as one of the winged creatures flew too close as they passed."Now this is how you celebrate Halloween," admitted Lee settling down in front of a table. Instead of the normal plates that were used everyday, the places were instead set with the golden variety normally used at the beginning and end of year feasts."I think it should be decorated like this every day," said George looking around the room just as the Halloween feast materialised in front of them."Wouldn't you get bored after a bit?" said Lee slicing open a baked potato."Nah," replied George shovelling a forkful of food into his mouth, "you'd think I'd get bored of teasing Percy but I still love it. It's basically the same thing.""How is that the same th…"Lee's question remained unasked as at that moment Professor Quirrell burst into the Great Hall and sprinted down the centre of the room. He had a look of pure panic on his face and his held his hand up to his turban that had become lopsided as he scampered towards the teachers table.Every student followed his journey with unwavering fascination, most had a look of bemusement on their faces while some gave out an occasional nervous laugh.Quirrell slumped onto the table in front of Dumbledore's chair and gasped for breath, "Troll… in the dungeons… thought you ought to know." He finished the sentence before sinking to the ground as he fainted.The room exploded into uproar. As students started panicking, their screams and shouts frighten the bats still hanging from the walls and ceiling into launching themselves into flight. The pupils now varied their screams between worrying about the troll and worrying about the bats. Despite the prefects' best efforts to bring the situation under control in the end it took several purple firecrackers exploding from Dumbledore's wand to bring a relative moment of quiet."Please remain calm," his voice echoed out reassuringly. "Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately.""Merlin's Beard look at Percy," said Fred lean towards Lee and George, "it's like Christmas has come early for him.""Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me. I'm a prefect," Percy bellowed leading the Gryffindor first years out of the Great Hall; he was clearly in his element."You'd wonder how a Troll got in wouldn't you?" said Lee as the three boys filtered into the crowd of students trying to leave the Great Hall."They are stupid at the best of times," admitted George shrugging, "it probably smelt the baked pumpkins, wandered out of the forest into the school and got lost in the dungeons.""You'd think they'd have something in place to stop stuff like that happening," said Lee thoughtfully."Yeah like a fence or something," agreed George."A fence wouldn't stop a Troll getting through," advised Fred shaking his head."So you're saying they'd probably need a sign?" asked George, "something along the lines of 'stop, this is a school for children not the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest.'""That'll be a pretty big sign," said Fred scratching his chin, "plus you'd have to translate it into all the difference languages. Do Trolls even have their own language?""I have no idea," admitted Lee, "we could always ask I suppose.""Ask the Troll?" Fred turned to his friend with a smile on his face."Are you suggesting that against the orders of Dumbledore to return to our dormitories that instead we should head down to the dungeons on the off chance we'll meet a Troll?" asked George looking at his friend."Well how many chances are we going to have to see a Troll up close?" replied Lee."See? And people always say that it is us who lead you astray," Fred beamed.Amid the confusion of the situation the three boys managed to detach themselves from the procession of Gryffindor students and fell into line with those heading towards Slytherin House. As they approached a tapestry that they knew had a hidden doorway behind it, the three boys sunk down to their knees and pretended to be tying their shoelaces as they waited for the line of Slytherin students to pass them by.Free from witnesses they pushed passed the wall-hanging and into the hidden corridor beyond. George led the way as the three boys carefully made their way down to the bottom of a stairwell which let them out in the cold surroundings of the dungeon."Where now?" asked Lee looking around in the darkness, the three boys took out their wands and used them to light the way."No idea," admitted George, "I left the Marauders' Map in our room.""Well Slytherin House is that way," said Fred pointing down one of the corridors, "so we'll probably want to stay away from there.""Good thinking," said Lee as the three of them turned to head in the other direction."It's definitely been down here," said George pinching his nose, "that's disgusting.""Er… actually that was me," said Fred bashfully, "sorry, it was the roasted sprouts.""We're just lucky there are no candles around," admitted Lee trying to covering his nose with the sleeve of his shirt."Oh for Godric-sake, seriously what is wrong with you?" admonished George a few minutes later, jamming his hand over his face."Okay, that wasn't me," Fred advised them, this time pinching his own nose, "it's getting worse too.""I think he's right," said Lee pointing further down the corridor. Up ahead in the dark hallway was an open door, the light from inside the room shone brightly against the wall opposite, a shadow flickered back and forth."Looks like this is it," whispered George as the three of them edged their way closer to the light."I think that is the boys' toilets," said Lee trying to remember the layout of the dungeons from their Potion lessons."We could lock it in," said Fred as they got close enough to see the open door pushed back against the inside wall."Worth a try," admitted George.Before they could get any closer to the door, there was suddenly a loud explosion followed by the sound of a torrent of water splashing hard against the ground."ARGHHHH!" a horrific cry came from inside the boys toilets, suddenly a dank foul smelling figure lurched out into the corridor."Run for it!" ordered George just before all three of the boys fired off the first spell that came into their heads at the disgusting creature. Not waiting to see if they'd stopped the beast in its tracks the boys turned tail and sprinted back in the direction they came from not pausing until they were back in the hidden passageway that had led them down to the dungeon."Merlin's Beard," gasped Lee sinking down to his knees to catch his breath, "that Troll was disgusting.""I know," agreed George gratefully taking in a large lungful of air, "he smelt worse then Charlie's socks.""Really? Charlie's socks?" asked Fred breathing hard, "I would have said that was about even."The boys made their way up the hidden passageway, and peered out from behind the tapestry. Just as they were about to step into the corridor they had to quickly hide again as McGonagall hurried passed once they were sure that no one else was going to be coming by they continued on their journey through the school up to Gryffindor House."Pig snout," said George, causing the Fat Lady to slowly open up. A wave of noise passed over them. The Common Room was packed with people; everyone was eating the food from the Halloween feast that had been sent up to them. The boys went and quickly grabbed a plate each and piled food onto them from the various dishes arranged on a table against the wall."Where have you three been?" asked Angelina as George squeezed himself onto the arm of her chair."Oh nowhere really," said George casually as he balanced his plate with one hand and pick at the food with the fork, "just been fighting the Troll.""The Troll?" Alicia asked wide-eyed."Don't mind them," dismissed Angelina, "they're just kidding.""Nope, I'm telling the truth," stated George, he looked at Angelina's expression of disbelief, "I know, it's weird, but honestly we fought the Troll down in the dungeons. If you don't believe me ask Lee, he never lies.""Is it true?" said Angelina turning her focus to Lee."Not entirely," admitted Lee, "I tell the odd lie but compared to these two that's nothing.""No you idiot, I meant about the Troll.""Oh that, yeah that's true," nodded Lee, "we headed down to the dungeon and ran into it.""What did you do?" asked Alicia excitedly"We faced it down like the lions we are," said Fred puffing out his chest."You ran away didn't you?" asked Angelina raising an eyebrow."Yes, but bravely, like lions," concluded Fred."How do you run away bravely?" queried Alicia."It's quite difficult," admitted George, "but somehow we managed it.""So you actually saw the Troll?" enquired Alicia eagerly."Yeah," nodded Lee swallowing his mouthful of food, "it was disgusting, and smelt worse then it looked, there was one weird thing though.""Which was?""Well I always thought that Trolls were supposed to be over ten feet tall, but this one was only about six foot at a push.""Maybe it was only a young Troll," said Alicia thoughtfully."Looks like you three weren't the only ones to have got distracted on the way back here," Angelina nodded towards the doorway where Harry Potter and the twins' youngest brother Ron had just stepped through. They were met by the bushy haired and rather bossy first year girl called Hermione and exchanged a few words before they headed to the table with the food. The twins beckoned them over."Where have you two been?" George asked them as they managed to slot into a spare spot next to the wall."In the girls' toilets," said Ron taking a mouthful of food."I always knew you were the weird one in the family," said Fred shaking his head, "which is lucky, because for a long time I suspected it might have been me.""We fought the Troll; it was in the girls' toilets," explained Harry."You fought the Troll as well?" asked Angelina looking pointedly towards the twins, "just how many are there wandering around the school?""You can't have fought the Troll," complained Fred shaking his head, "we fought it.""Oh we definitely did," nodded Ron enthusiastically, "Harry jumped on its back and stuck his wand up its nose, and I knocked it out with its own club. McGonagall herself awarded us five points each.""Where was this Troll again?" asked Lee his brow crinkled in confusion."The girls' toilets on the ground floor," said Harry taking a bite out of a baked potato."There is no way it managed to get from the boys' toilets in the dungeons up to the ground floor girls' toilets in such a short space of time," said George thoughtfully tapping his chin with his finger, "maybe there was two after all.""What did this Troll look like?" Angelina inquired."It was horrible," admitted Ron, excited to be the focus of attention, "about twelve feet tall, gray skin, with a huge great lumpy body, stubby legs and a balding head.""Twelve feet tall? Are you sure?""Pretty sure," agreed Harry, "I got quite close to it, and it was definitely that big.""Well that settles that then," said Angelina looking at the twins triumphantly, "there is no way what you three came across was a Troll.""I wonder what the hell it could have been?" said Fred frowning.****"Ah Minerva," Dumbledore greeted the Deputy Headmistress as she entered his office, "I trust everything is in order.""Yes Headmaster," she said crossing the room to stand in front of Dumbledore's desk, "the Troll was actually subdued in the girls' toilets by Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter. I awarded them both five points for their efforts, although I advised them of how dangerous their actions were.""Youthful folly my dear Minerva," smiled Dumbledore, "you should have seen what I got up to in my first year. Hogwarts is a place of learning, and what better way to learn then through our own mistakes. It's probably too late to get everyone back down to the Great Hall so I think we shall leave them to enjoy the feasts in their own Common Rooms.""Very good Headmaster," nodded McGonagall, "there is one more thing you should know about?""And what is that?""There was a problem with one of the toilets in the boys' bathroom in the dungeons, it seems the water was backing up and flooding the floor." explained McGonagall, "I believe Peeves may have had a hand in blocking it. I still don't understand why you tolerate him.""A Hogwarts without Peeves would be like Quidditch without a Snitch, it could work but it just wouldn't be as fun.""Or as dangerous," countered McGonagall, "anyway, I dispatched Mr Filch to fix the problem and it seems that Peeves managed to get hold of some Ever Exploding Waterproof Fireworks and somehow used them to block to toilet, when Mr Filch was trying to clear the blockage, Peeves set them off.""Ah… a rather messy outcome I am assuming?""Yes," agreed McGonagall, "not only did Filch get covered in… well… I won't say it exactly but I'm sure you can imagine, but it appears Peeves may have followed up with a few hexes. Madam Pompfrey is currently attending to him but I suspect the use of at least the leg-lock curse and a hic-cupping hex.""Peeves using hexes?" sighed Dumbledore, "so he managed to get hold of another wand did he? Well I suppose we should be grateful that the school is still standing especially after what happened last time. I will have a word with him and ask him to return the wand to its rightful owner.""Very good, but there is another reason why I informed you about all this.""Yes?""Filch is on his way up to demand that Peeves be kicked out of the school, and I thought I'd better let you know so you could take precautions.""Such as?""A Bubble-Head charm should do the trick," said McGonagall grimly, "he hasn't had a shower yet."

As the month changed to November, the weather turned extremely cold. The peaks of the mountains surrounding the school became thick with snow and the lake became so icy that only the bravest or most foolhardy would dare dip even a toe into the freezing water. Every morning there was a fresh crisp frost on grounds of the school, and, despite the numerous fireplaces and heating spells used by the teachers to keep their lessons warm, the corridors did not give much protection from the cold. Especially seeing as Peeves took much delight in opening as many windows in the school as he could.Outside of classes, most of the students had taken to retreating to the warmth of the Common Rooms where the crackling fires gave some refuge from the harsh winter conditions."That's it," said George huddled up gratefully in front of the fireplace. He had a heavy looking jumper on and had pulled his hands back into the sleeves for extra warmth, "I don't care what happens, I'm not moving from this fire the whole weekend.""What about lunch and dinner?" asked Lee relaxing in the basking glow of the flames. He too was similarly dressed in warm looking clothes and was rubbing his hands together before exposing them to the fire."Well you and Fred can just pick me something up from the table," said George waving a hand dismissively. He closed his eyes and let out a long satisfied sigh."What about if you need the toilet?" asked Fred raising an eyebrow, "don't think Lee and I are helping you out with that.""I'll cross that bridge when I come to it," replied George after a few moments of thoughtful consideration.There was a clattering of footsteps coming from stairs leading to the girls' dormitories. The three boys shifted their position so they could see what the commotion was. They were greeted to the sight of Angelina, Alicia and Katie all rushing down the stairs, hurriedly trying to force on shoes or wrapping coats and scarves around themselves."No need to hurry ladies," said George, "there's plenty of time to get me a Christmas present, it's only November after all, but if you must insist, there are a number of Zonko items that I have my eye on.""Very funny," snorted Angelina plonking a large woollen hat down over her head and pulling it down over her ears, "we're getting out of here, apparently Oliver is on his way up.""And what?" said Fred leaning back in his chair lazily, "you just can't stand being around him? Oliver seems to have that effect on women.""Well according to Emma Singleton," explained Katie quickly as Angelina tapped her foot impatiently, "she overheard Kevin McGillycud being told by Aziza Bexley that he'd seen Maxwell Chesterly and Leanne Burbank talking about how they had overheard Oliver talking to Madam Hooch about booking the Quidditch pitch for after breakfast.""So?" frowned Lee shrugging."Quidditch practice? In this weather?" Alicia asked wide-eyed.Lee and the twins looked over at the window. If someone had said that 'it was a bit windy outside' it would have been like them saying that 'Voldemort had been a bit naughty' when he tried to take over the wizarding world. There is a pastime enjoyed by a very select, and some would say down right potty, group of wizards. It's called Windriding, and basically, involves flying your broom into the heart of a storm and trying to stay on for as long as possible. Windriders are some of the bravest or, depending on your point of view, insane, members of wizarding society and even they would have looked out of the window and decided that a nice cup of tea and a warm blanket would be a better idea."He wouldn't make us practice in this," said Fred uncertainly. The wind was buffeting against the glass so hard that it made an ungodly sound as it rushed passed."This is Oliver we are talking about," stated Angelina still tapping her foot and looking across at the back of the portrait opening"What in Godric's name are we waiting for?" exclaimed George jumping up instantly."What about a coat?" asked Fred looking towards the boys' dormitories."No time," Lee retorted as the group headed towards the portrait hole.As Angelina reached the doorway, it swung open into the corridor. She had to stop abruptly as someone was trying to get through."Ah Angelina," the voice of Oliver echoed out into the room, "I was just coming to see you, who's that behind you? Katie, and Alicia as well? Brilliant.""Hi Oliver," said Katie and Alicia glumly. Angelina stepped back into the Common Room to allow the Quidditch Captain in."Good news," Oliver beamed at his team, "Slytherin had the Quidditch pitch booked for this morning, but for some reason they decided to cancel their practice. Once I found that out, I was right over to Madam Hooch and luckily she said it was ours if we wanted it.""You really can't see why they would have cancelled their practice?" asked Angelina folding her arms and thinking that she had almost made it to freedom."No, why?"As if to answer Oliver, at that moment a large screech owl that had been trying desperately to get back to the owlery smacked against the window as a strong gale caught hold of it. Everyone in the room looked at the sight of the stricken creature disappearing from view before looking back at the Quidditch Captain, who still had an expression of utter ignorance etched onto his face."Owls eh? They should watch where they are going more. So anyway," said Oliver rubbing his hands together, "I already saw Harry on my way up, so he already knows, we just need to find Fred and George.""Fred and George? They're right…" Alicia frowned before looking behind her. Neither Lee nor the twins were standing there anymore, "… there?"Angelina stepped forward and drew her gaze over the room, after a few moments she locked her eyes onto one of the large armchairs in the corner of the room. She headed over and looked behind it. She reached down."Ouch, hey…" complained Fred steadily getting to his feet as Angelina pulled him up by one of his ears. She let go once he was standing, "ow, that really hurt. Oh hi Oliver, I didn't see you there.""Hi…er… why were you hiding behind the armchair?""I wasn't hiding," dismissed Fred still rubbing his ear, "I…er… dropped something and was just looking for it.""What did you drop?" asked Angelina pointedly, "your spine?""You should just better hope that you didn't damage my ear," complained Fred, he turned around to look in a mirror that hung on the wall of the Common Room, "I think you stretched it, it looks stretched to me.""Did you hear the good news?" asked Oliver looking at Fred's reflection in the mirror."No," lied Fred, turning back around once he was satisfied that his ear was still the same size it had been when he woke up that morning. He pointed towards the window, "I couldn't hear anything over the hurricane currently going on outside.""Oh well I've booked the Quidditch pitch for practice," Oliver informed him completely ignoring the subtle hint. "Slytherin had it booked but they cancelled.""Obviously," nodded Fred, clamouring out from behind the armchair, before resting back on its arm, "only a complete idiot would give up the chance of trying to fly in that storm.""I know, right?" Oliver Wood: naturally impervious to sarcasm. "Where's your brother?""I think I know," said Angelina standing next to a bulky set of curtains. She nodded her head down. Sticking out of the bottom of the drape were two feet. She pulled it back dramatically."Hi guys," said Lee awkwardly standing behind the curtain."Hi Lee," nodded Oliver, "have you seen er… the other one? Sorry, I still can't tell you apart.""That's okay, I'm Fred. You'll be able to tell us apart now since I'm the one with the slightly lopsided ear.""Why were you hiding?" asked Angelina Lee quietly, ignoring Fred's complaining, "it's not as if you are on the team.""I panicked." He replied sheepishly. Luckily for Lee, everyone else was suddenly distracted by the sound of a loud sneeze emanating from underneath a chaise-lounge at the side of the room."Alright?" said Alicia bending over and addressing George, who had somehow impressively managed to scuttle under the chair without being seen."Hiya Alicia, damn dust," said George gradually crawling out, "hey Oliver.""Did you…?""Yes, yes," George interrupted him and nodding, "Quidditch practice, Slytherin cancelled, yay for us.""Excellent," smiled Oliver looking decidedly happy. He looked up at the clock on the wall, "okay down at the pitch in an hour then.""Would any one really mind if I killed him?" asked Angelina after Oliver bounded up the stairs to the boys' dormitory.""I would," admitted Fred still watching the stairs, "mainly because I what to be the one to do it.""Honestly where is your team spirit?" asked Lee pointedly settling down in front of the toasty warm fire, "if I was on the team I'd be out there practicing during rain, wind and snow. Of course I'm not, so sadly instead I'll just stay here and keep warm."Would any one mind if I killed him instead?" said Angelina nodding towards Lee.****"Okay I changed my mind," said Fred as he stood with his brother and the Chasers, "I don't care if I don't get to be the one to kill Oliver but could someone just get on and do it so I can get back inside?"The five Gryffindor students were huddled together at the side of the Quidditch pitch, each of them were wrapped from head to toe in as many warm clothes as they could manage. In fact, George had gone the extra mile, located a number of hot water bottles, and stuffed them inside his coat for good measure."Here comes our fearless leader," stated Fred stamping his feet on the frost covered ground. The group looked over their shoulders to see Oliver approaching the pitch. He was talking animatedly with the team's new Seeker, Harry Potter, who looked as cold as the rest of them. They were carrying the equipment trunk that contained the various balls used during the game."Morning team," Oliver greeted them smiling."Oliver are you serious about us flying in this?" asked Angelina pointing behind her."What's wrong with it?" said Oliver, raising his voice so that he could be heard above the wind, "it's bracing.""Bracing? Suicide is what it is," complained Angelina."It's good practice," Oliver countered, "what happens if the day of our first match the weather is like this?""Then Madam Hooch would call off the match and we'd replay it another week," replied Alicia."Call off a Quidditch match? For a little bit of wind? I don't think so," said Oliver shaking his head in amusement."Fine, watch this," snapped Angelina. She stepped forward, opened the equipment trunk and took out the Quaffle. She held it in her hand for a moment before launching it high into the air. The team watched as the ball was caught by the wind and dragged down the far end of the pitch before hitting the ground, even after it touched down it continued to roll for a good while before coming to a stop. Angelina turned back to Oliver with her hands on her hips."What's your point?""My point," exclaimed Angelina "is that we physically can't play in this weather.""Of course you can," stated Oliver thinking that the only thing wrong was that his team lacked confidence to fly in the windy conditions, "you guys are easily good enough to play in this weather.""I give up," snorted Angelina throwing her hands up."Let me try a different approach," advised Fred. He placed a hand on Oliver's shoulder, "Oliver, you know and I know, that practice makes perfect.""Exactly.""And that normally we would all gladly love to put in extra Quidditch practice no matter what the conditions," Fred continued to inform his captain, "but if we practice today there is a very good chance that one of us could get injured by a twig or stone…""Or a Chaser smacking someone over the head with their broom," muttered Angelina under her breath."… being blown into their face," said Fred ignoring his friend, "and the last thing we want is to have an injured player so close to our next game.""You know I hadn't even considered that," admitted Oliver thoughtfully, "do you really think someone could get injured in this?""Oliver, do you see that tree over there?" said Fred pointing towards the edge of the Forbidden Forest, "well up until about ten minutes ago it was standing upright. Yes, I think there is a very good chance someone could get injured in this weather.""I suppose," admitted Oliver reluctantly, "but we've got the pitch booked all morning so if the weather gets better we'll come back out okay.""Of course," agreed Fred in voice that was generally only used by people carefully negotiating hostage situations.The relieved group headed back towards the castle, they huddled together as best as they could to try to conserve warmth between them until they gratefully got inside the school."If the weather doesn't die down today, maybe we'll fit in some extra practice tomorrow morning," sighed Oliver still looking hopefully at the outside blustering gale."On a Sunday morning?" asked George raising an eyebrow."Yeah it'll be perfect," nodded Oliver, "no one ever books the Quidditch pitch for practice on a Sunday morning.""That's probably because they are all enjoying a nice long lie in," Katie pointed out."Really?" frowned Oliver, "Why?""Because it's a Sunday," George tried again, "it's the day you're supposed to have a long lie in.""Are you sure? Never heard of that," said Oliver shaking his head, "well, I'll just go and find Madam Hooch after I er… well… you know," he nodded towards the boys' toilets."He just doesn't get a hint does he?" said Angelina aloud once he had disappeared from sight."Right that's it," snapped George, "he can drag me out into the cold, make me do ridiculous exercise routines, and take up most of my nights with extra practice. But no one, and I mean no one, stops George's Sunday lie in. It's traditional for Godric's-sake."Under the watchful gaze of the rest of the team, George stomped forward, took his wand from his pocket and pointed it at the keyhole of the boy's toilet door."Colloportus!" chanted George. There was an audible click as the door magically locked itself, "there. Let's see him go and find Madam Hooch now."

"Merlin's Beard did you see him catch that Snitch? Did you?" asked Oliver as the majority of the Gryffindor Quidditch team headed back up towards the school. "He didn't even need to use his hands. He caught it in his mouth. In his mouth! Did you see that?""Yes Oliver, we were all there," said Angelina rolling her eyes before shaking her head."Did you watch him fly though?" said Oliver moving his hand through the air as he demonstrated Harry's flying abilities."Yes Oliver, he flew very well," agreed Katie adopting the same monotone voice as Angelina had."Well? Well? He flew bloody brilliantly, we're going to win the cup this year for sure," said Oliver his eyes widening as he pictured holding the trophy aloft."That's what I like to see," said George slapping the Quidditch Captain on the back. "You're keeping a level head and not getting ahead of yourself in any way, shape or form.""We have a Seeker now. A good Seeker. A great Seeker in fact. We'll be unstoppable," said Oliver sounding quite maniacal. He quickly looked around the group to administer more praise on the latest team member and frowned when he saw that he wasn't there. "Where is he anyway?""I think I saw him heading over to Hagrid's hut," said Fred gesturing in the rough direction of the gamekeeper's house."Yeah, I think he was a bit shaken up about what happened," nodded Alicia shaking her head and recalling the incident during the match with Slytherin where Harry's broom suddenly and unexpectantly seemed to try and buck him off. "I still can't believe he managed to stay on. I wonder what was up with it.""Isn't it obvious?" said Oliver looking at the girl. She just shrugged in a way of response. "It was a hex.""Don't be silly," snorted Katie shaking her head. "It's more likely he just lost control of it. He's only been flying for a few months after all.""I'm telling you it was a hex," stated Oliver firmly rubbing his chin with a hand. "And I know exactly how to blame?"There was a momentary silence."Well? Don't any of you want to know who is to blame?" asked Oliver after it became apparent that no one was going to say anything."Who?" sighed Alicia."Slytherin, that's who," said Oliver knowingly, as he tapped the side of his nose with a finger. "I would say it was probably Flint but he's a bit too stupid to manage that.""Are there even spells that can do that?" asked Angelina."Oh there are spell all right, several in fact," nodded Oliver."Oh my God," said Angelina looking at the Quidditch captain. "You've looked them up haven't you?""I might have stumbled across the odd book on the subject," replied Oliver defensively."Really? Where?""In the restricted section," said Oliver. Angelina raised an eyebrow. "I was researching for my Defence Against the Dark Arts essay and I just happened to find a book which had a number of spells that could, given the right modification, be used to give someone an advantage in a game of Quidditch. I would never use them myself of course.""Well that's good," said Angelina, happy that her faith had been restored in her captain."Mainly because I couldn't get them to work," muttered Oliver under his breath."Oliver!""What? I said I couldn't get them to work," replied Oliver quickly."But you think somebody did?" asked George before Angelina could fire back a retort."Yeah, and I'd love to know how they did it. So I could stop them," Oliver added the last bit after he saw Angelina about to say something."Shouldn't we tell Madam Hooch about it?" asked Katie."We don't have any proof," Fred pointed out."What about Harry's broom? Everybody saw what happened," said Alicia."Yeah and everyone except for the completely demented would think that he lost control of the broom," said Angelina casting a sidelong look at Oliver."Exactly, so you see what we're up against," agreed Oliver. The group had now entered the school and were about to start heading up the staircase to the upper levels. "Wait, let's go this way.""Why?" asked George, as the team duly followed their captain. He led them through a corridor into the trophy room, where a well known hidden passageway behind one of the portraits led up to the second floor. "This way is no quicker then using the stairs.""I know but going this way means we get to look at this," Oliver stopped in front of a cabinet filled with cups, trophies and awards of all shapes and sizes. Right in the centre of the cabinet, in pride of place, was the school's Quidditch Cup. The Gryffindor captain pressed his hand longingly against the glass. "Isn't it beautiful?"The rest of the team looked at each other as Oliver gazed at the trophy in wonder."Um… Oliver? We're probably going to just…" Angelina pointed towards the portrait with the hidden passageway."Sorry? What? Oh yes, of course. See you later," said Oliver distractedly without taking his eyes away from the cabinet."So, we're just going to leave him there?" asked Katie as the team made their way to the portrait. Alicia pushed against one side of the frame and it sprung forward to reveal a dimly lit stairwell."Probably be best, he looks like he might be a while," said Fred looking over his shoulder at Oliver. The team began filtering up the stairs. The portrait closed behind George."He's a bit…" Alicia tried to find the right words."Disturbed?" ventured George from the back of the group."I was going to say enthusiastic but disturbed would work just as well," shrugged Alicia. "You don't really think that someone hexed Harry's broom?""It is possible I suppose," conceded Angelina. "Everyone likes to win but hexing a broom would need dark magic and no one would do that just to win a game of Quidditch, well apart from Oliver maybe.""It's times like this that I'm grateful he is on our side," said George."Yeah," agreed Fred. "At least he only tries to kill us using practice sessions."The team made their way up to Gryffindor Tower and slipped into the Common room through the portrait of the Fat Lady. As she swung open they were greeted by a wave of noise from the celebrating students inside. Each team member was cheered as they stepped through the portal and there seemed to be a party in full flow in their honour."Alright Lee?" said George waving to his friend. Due to having a mouthful of pumpkin pie, courtesy of the House-Elves in the kitchen, Lee could only nod hello and had to furiously munch down his food before he could reply."Good game guys," said Lee eventually managing to swallow the food."Cheers," said Fred picking up a pie from the pile on the table. "One down two to go.""Assuming we don't get hexed to death," concluded George looking at the platter of food available."What?" asked Lee. The twins quickly brought their friend up to speed with Oliver's theory that Harry's broom had been cursed. "That's ridiculous," he said shaking his head, suddenly he remembered something. "Although…""Although what?" asked Fred causing several lumps of pumpkin pie to be spat out as he spoke."Didn't Enoch say to watch out for anything unusual?" said Lee flicking his eyes between his two friends."Yeah but it was just a Quidditch game," shrugged George."Don't let Oliver hear you say that," advised Fred elbowing his brother, before looking at Lee. "He's right though.""But it wasn't just the Quidditch game though was it? There was the troll in the dungeon as well," said Lee reminding the two boys of the incident earlier in the year."I thought McGonagall said that it had just wandered in from the forest to keep warm.""Well the teachers would say that wouldn't they George?" said Lee shaking his head at his friend's naivety. "Trolls are way too dumb to have found their way into the school without help, but they don't want to panic us by telling the truth.""I don't know," said Fred rubbing his chin. "It's just a little far-fetched to think anyone would try and harm us with a troll, plus it was Harry's broom that was playing up not either of ours.""Maybe they hexed the wrong broom by mistake," said Lee shrugging his shoulders."Wouldn't it just be easier to attack us directly?" said George."You mean right under the nose of Dumbledore? No one would be that stupid to try and attack a student while he is here," said Lee thoughtfully."Tell you what, I'll write to Enoch and tell him what has happened, and we'll see what he says about it," said Fred.****The reply from their uncle came back two weeks later, and caused much amusement from the occupants of the Great Hall that day. As the usual flurry of owls made their way into the hall a huge white pelican flapped into view, barging most of the other birds out of the way as it tried to land in front of the twins."Bloody hell," said George looking up at the creature as it landed awkwardly on the table. "What's it doing?""I'm not sure," said Fred leaning back on the bench to try and distance himself from the bird's oversized beak, which it had opened toward the pair. "I think it wants you to reach inside.""I'm not sticking my hand in there," retorted George. "It'll probably bite it off or something.""Well we're gonna have to do something, everybody's staring," said Fred looking around. He nodded uncomfortably at the nearest group of Ravenclaws."Fine," said George peering forward, the pelican leaned its head down and opened its mouth wider. "Keep still, will you?"After a few hesitant tries George eventually fished out a letter from the pouch under the beak. As soon as it had been removed the creature, shook its head in relief at finally having delivered its package, let out a loud squawk and clumsily took to the air again."It smells of fish," said George wrinkling his nose."You don't think that could be the kippers you are having for breakfast," said Lee nodding towards the plate in front of the boy."Oh," George sniffed the envelope and then the plate of food. "No, I'd say it's about the same really.""I don't want to compare it," complained Fred as his brother held the letter up to his nose. "Just open it will you?""Fine," sighed George as he carefully opened the envelope using the tips of his fingers. He scanned the first few words quickly. "Oh, it's from Enoch.""Typical, we should have been able to guess that from the pelican," said Fred, using the end of his wand to push the now discarded envelope further away from him on the table. "What's it say?""Well first he apologises for sending the pelican," said George reading from the letter. "Apparently owls are hard to come by where he is.""Which is?" asked Lee, subtly using his own wand to push the envelope back towards Fred."He doesn't say," said George skimming the letter for any clues. "Just in case it gets intercepted he doesn't want to run the risk of revealing his location.""He's a bit paranoid isn't he?" said Fred casually flicking the envelope closer to Lee."With good reason," said George reading on. "From the sound of it over the last few weeks he's pretty much been under attack from someone constantly. At the moment he is holed up with an old friend on an extremely well protected island, so he thinks he is safe but he is worried that the attacker might make good on his threat and come after us.""What did we ever do?" complained Fred watching as the envelope wafted back in his direction due to a spell from Lee."Do you actually want me come up with a list?" asked Lee as the envelope was gradually nudged back towards him. "Because I really don't think I'd have the time for that.""I just think he is being a bit overprotective," shrugged Fred. The envelope was now being subjected to a two different spells from the boys each trying to force it to in the opposite direction."Just a bit," said George reading the rest of the letter. "Look at this, Enoch thinks the safest place for us is to remain at school rather than head home for Christmas so he's managed to convince Charlie to invite mum and dad over for the holidays. It means we're going to be stuck at school.""Here?" asked Fred not looking away from the envelope. Both he and Lee had given up trying to be subtle and were now openly trying to force it to do their bidding. "Over the holidays? With nothing to do?""Well I suppose there is Hogsmeade," said George now watching the ongoing battle over the envelope, which seemed to have drawn the attention of plenty of other students."And the school is always a laugh to explore," said Fred concentrating hard."Plus there is the forbidden forest," added Lee frowning as the envelope twisted in the air."Actually staying around here might not be too bad," conceded George thoughtfully. He frowned as he looked up at the floating piece of paper. Under the effects of the spells it had started to spout thin wisps of smoke. "Er… guys? Maybe you should stop that now.""What and let him win?" said Lee sticking his tongue out of the corner of his mouth as he focused on the task at hand."Oi you two," called Filch stomping down the isle between the House tables. "What do you think you are playing at? Don't you know the rules about magic outside of class?""That it is approved and actively encouraged?" ventured Fred."What? No, don't be so stupid. It's against the rules," snapped Filch wagging a finger at him. "Stop it this instance and come with me.""I'll stop it after he stops it," said Fred nodding towards his friend."You stop first," countered Lee."How about you both stop at the same time?" said George offering a compromise."Sounds good," said Fred as Lee also indicated his approval with a slight shrug. "On the count of three? One. Two. Three… you didn't stop.""Neither did you.""Well I wouldn't have to if you did," explained Fred which no doubt made perfect sense to him if not anyone else."That's enough," snapped Filch reaching out to grab the envelope from the air."I wouldn't do that if I were you," advised George."Oh wouldn't you?" sneered Filch sarcastically. "I'm the adult, you're the child. I tell you what to do, not the other way around."The caretaker snatched the envelope out of the air and looked at George triumphantly. His victory was short lived however as the paper suddenly exploded in a burst of flame leaving Filch with a soot smudge face and singed eyebrows. He looked at George with a furious expression."I know, I know," sighed George standing up and throwing his bag over his shoulder. "Your office. Now."

"I
can't see why we have to do this," complained Fred scooping up a
shovel full of snow off one of the pathways and wandering over to the
large pile before dumping it on top."Really?
You don't?" asked Lee watching the twins undergoing their
punishment. "It's because you bewitched those snowballs to follow
Professor Quirriel and continually hit him on the back of the head.""Well,
I know why
we are being punished," said Fred heading back towards the path. "I
just want to know why Filch couldn't have come up with something
inside where it is warm.""As
far as I can make out," said George throwing his shovelful of snow
onto the pile. "The paths need to be cleared either way and by
getting us to do it Filch doesn't have to come out into the cold."George
stopped and dug the end of the shovel into the ground before resting
his arm on it and pausing to catch his breath."Oi!
No stopping! Get back to work," shouted the voice of Filch. The
twins and Lee looked up to see the caretaker leaning out of one of
the upstairs windows."How
come he gets to be in the warm?" asked George glumly as he scraped
his shovel across the ground again."Probably
because he isn't in detention," said Lee wrapping his arms around
himself."What
are you doing out here anyway?" said Fred throwing more snow on the
increasing mount."Oh
I wanted to know if I could borrow one of your essays on the
Invisible Creeping Cacti to read. I swear if I forget to do another
homework parchment for Sprout she'll put me in detention, and I
don't particularly want to have to spend an afternoon helping to
pot plants," advised Lee as his breath fogged in the air."I've
haven't done mine yet, I was going to copy off Fred," said George
nodding towards his brother."Off
me? I was going to copy off you," complained Fred."I
guess that means we'll both be copying off you then," said George
looking at Lee."I
haven't done it, remember? That's what I was doing out here in
the first place," said Lee tapping the side of his head with a
gloved finger."Honestly
Lee, you really should put in some forward planning," tutted Fred
shaking his head."I
can't believe you haven't done your homework, who are we supposed
to copy it off now?" asked George looking disappointedly at his
friend."You
haven't done it either," snorted Lee letting out a small cloud of
warm breath."Yes,
but obviously we were going to end up in detention, and wouldn't be
able to get it done in time," said George."So
we were counting on copying it off you," added Fred."Hang
on," said Lee pointing at Fred. "You just said that you were
planning on copying it off George not me.""I
was looking at George but I was talking to you," replied Fred
quickly."You
really are a special kind of idiot aren't you?" said Lee shaking
his head."It's
the best kind to be," smiled Fred throwing another spade of snow
onto the pile."Well
since none of us have done the essay that really only leaves us with
one option," said George thoughtfully."Stay
up late tonight and work on it together?" asked Lee doubtfully."I
like you Lee, you make me laugh," said George grinning. "Nope,
we're going to have to copy off someone else.""Angelina?
I don't think she is
going to help us out, not after last time," said Fred rubbing the
end of his running nose with the back of a glove."It's
not our fault she got
in trouble," said George shaking his head."You
copied their homework word for word," Lee interjected. "Then you
handed yours in first and she
was put in
detention for copy yours.""Do
you think she'll still hold a grudge about that?" asked George
sounding hopeful."Oh
no, I doubt that," said Lee sarcastically. "In fact why don't
you go and ask her when you are done here? Just make sure you tell me
first because I'm going to want a front row seat for that.""Maybe
not," said George picturing the likely outcome if he approached
Angelina for her homework, the image involved his head, a toilet bowl
and the rather unpleasant meeting of the two."I've
got it," exclaimed Fred surprising George who had been in mid-swing
with his spade, which promptly slipped from his hands and flew a good
ten feet away in the snow. Fred looked at him. "I'm not sure
that's the best way to clear the path.""Stupid
shovel," complained George stomping across the thick snow that
covered the ground. "What have you got anyway?""The
perfect person to copy from," beamed Fred. "I can't believe we
didn't think of it before, he's brilliant and always gets high
marks in all his work.""Right
we at least we know he isn't talking about either of us,"
conceded Lee."So?
Who is it?""Percy,"
said Fred smiling a wide grin."Do
you want to take this one or shall I?" asked George looking over
towards Lee."I'll
let you handle this, I'm still a bit tired," informed Lee."Fred,
asking Percy is a superb plan," said George as his brother
acknowledged the approval. "However there are just a few slight
snags that prevent it from being a perfect plan.""Such
as?""Well
off the top of my head," said George pretending to look serious.
"One; Percy isn't in our year, so he's not being set the same
homework as us. Two; even if he was
being set the same homework, again he is two years above us and would
therefore be using magical explanations way above what we are
learning. And three; and I think this is the most important part,
Percy would rather let us test out our Transfiguration spells on him
every day for the rest of his life than let us copy his homework. Oh
and four; you're an idiot.""A
special kind of idiot," Lee reminded his friend."Yes,
a special kind of idiot.""You
say that like it is a bad thing," said Fred frowning. "I'll
answer each of your problems in order. One; I'm aware that Percy
isn't in our year, if he was it would mean we were triplets and
quite frankly I can't think of anything as scary as that idea. Two;
he was set the same homework two years ago so he would be using
explanations that we are supposed to know. And three; I never
actually planned on asking his permission to copy his homework.""Are
you planning on trying to time travel back two years just so we can
copy Percy's homework?" asked Lee looking at the boy in
disbelief. "Because I can think of at least one more problem with
that.""No
I don't plan of time travelling, although it would be a good idea,
we should probably look into that," said Fred tapping a finger
against his chin. "No I just plan on sneaking into his room and
stealing it.""Erm…
I still think you have missed a major problem," said Lee trying not
to sound too condescending. "It's with the whole, Percy not being
given the same homework as us.""Yes
but as I said he would have been given it two years ago, and dear
Percy isn't the type to throw out his work," said Fred smiling,
neither his brother nor his friend seemed change their expressions of
confusion so he decided to put it in simpler terms. "He keeps all
his old homework.""You
can't be serious," said Lee shaking his head. He looked over at
George. "Can he?""You
could be on to something there," said George thoughtfully,
attempting to click his gloved fingers. "Remember when he returned
home after his first year, he brought all of his essays back and
stored them in his wardrobe.""Exactly,
and mum told him he couldn't bring any more home because we didn't
have enough room. That and we set fire to the ones he had already
brought back. Accidentally of course," added Fred after a look from
Lee."So,
you think he has
them here? Stored
in his room?" said Lee."I
would bet my reputation on it," stated Fred firmly."You
don't have a reputation," Lee pointed out."I
hope to get one from this," replied Fred without skipping a beat."Oi!"
shouted the voice of Filch, the three boys turned to see him
scampering out of the school and heading their way."Doesn't
he ever take a break?" muttered Fred shaking his head."What
is your punishment?" demanded the caretaker as he reached the boys."To
clear the path by hand," ventured George."Exactly,
to clear the path, not to spend all your time chatting to your
friend," said Filch. He jabbed a finger towards Fred. "You. Go to
the other end of the path and make a start there. You continue from
here. And you," he pointed at Lee so viciously the boy had to take
a step back to avoid being poked in the eye. "Bugger off.""Charming,"
mumbled Lee under his breath."See
you later," said Fred as their friend retreated to the warmth of
the castle."Not
if you don't get this cleared you won't," sneered Filch. He
shivered slightly before realising in his haste to reprimand the
twins he had forgotten to wrap a warm coat around himself. "I'll
be back in half an hour to check on your progress."It
was closer to twenty minutes in the end when the caretaker returned.
By arriving early he had no doubt wanted to catch the boys lazing
about when they should have been working. Needless to say he was
sorely disappointed to find not only that both boys were busy but
that they had almost completely the task."You've
managed to clear all that in the time it's taken me to have a
sandwich?" he demanded suspiciously."Of
course Mr Filch," said Fred looking up from his work."We
just took a leaf out of your book and got on with it," added George
moving another load of snow."You
did?" asked Filch looking between the two boys warily."Of
course," said Fred trying to look at the caretaker with false
admiration. "I mean, you're just one man but you manage to keep
something the size of Hogwarts cleaned to perfection.""Well,
it's not just all me… you know… House Elves," stammered Filch
trying to be modest."House-Elves?
Nonsense," said George shaking his head. "Sure they do little
bits here and there, but who does all the real work? Eh? Who?""Me?"
asked Filch a little bit uncertain."Exactly,"
nodded George. "Just you, with a single broom and no thanks. Every
day you are sweeping those halls and I don't want to speak ill of
my fellow students but they are an ungrateful lot aren't they?""Ungrateful?
Damn right they're ungrateful," snapped Filch angrily. "In the
week before term started I had this place gleaming, and then the
moment they
arrived I have to spend my days trailing after muddy footprints all
over my beautiful clean floors.""Tsk,
that is awful, did you hear that Fred?""I
heard George," said Fred shaking his head miserably. "This place
would fall down without you Mr Filch. Sure, Dumbledore gets all glory
whenever Hogwarts is mentioned but would he be able to do his job if
it wasn't for you making sure the school was running like
clockwork? Of course not.""You
can't spell Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft without
Filch," said George, and then thought about this for a few seconds
before correcting himself. "Well you can, but it would be spelt
Ogwarts Shoo of Wzardry and Witchcrat, and who would want to go to a
school like that? Not me that's for sure.""Nor
me, or anyone else with half a brain," agreed Fred. "Which is why
we've started a campaign.""We
have? I mean, yes we have," said George quickly recovering."What
sort of campaign?" asked Filch looking suspiciously between the two
boys."To
get your own chapter in Hogwarts; A History of course," said Fred
looking at Filch as though the answer should have been obvious.""My
own chapter?" said Filch getting a far away look in his eyes."At
the very least," said George taking the cue from his brother.
"We've already started a petition amongst the rest of the school.
Got a good few signatures too, we were going to write off to
Chroniculus Punnet and get him to add your chapter into the latest
edition but, well what with one thing and another we just haven't
had the time.""Oh
you haven't?" said Filch looking a little disappointed."No,"
sighed Fred looking rather devastated. "We were going to do it this
morning but well we had to do this.""Well
you're nearly done," said Filch hopefully as he looked at the
remainder of the path that needed clearing."Yes
but then it'll be lunch time, and we have Quidditch practice after
that, plus we have a whole bunch of homework to finish before the
weekend is over. I just don't think we'll get around to it, this
morning was really the only time we had free. It'll disappoint so
many people too," said George really laying the false sincerity on
as thickly as he could."Oh,"
said Filch thoughtfully. An idea suddenly occurred to him. "Maybe
you could get someone to help
finish…""Good
thinking Mr Filch," stated George quickly, he held his shovel out
in front of the caretaker who took it from his hands almost
automatically. "I knew we could count on you to see the importance
of our cause.""Honestly
Mr Filch, every day when I come across a problem I just think to
myself 'what would Mr Filch do?' And once I do that, the answer
always becomes clear," said Fred jabbing his spade into the ground
and heading passed the caretaker as the two boys started making their
way back to the school."I
didn't mean…" Filch started to say but was quickly interrupted
by George."Well
it has to be you doesn't it?""Of
course it does," added Fred enthusiastically. "Who else would
clear this path to the high standards that this school deserves? Only
you Mr Filch with you keen sense of hard work.""Dedication,"
said George nodding."Attention
to detail," agreed Fred as the caretaker puffed his chest out. "No
one else would take such pride in a job well done.""We're
counting on you Mr Filch, make us proud," said George firing off a
snappy salute, causing the man to stiffen to attention with the
shovel held over his shoulder like a rifle."My
own chapter," muttered Filch happily to himself as he started to
move the snow off the path. He paused for a moment looking at the
shovelful of white powder. He looked back up towards the school
where the two boys were disappearing through the doors. He looked
back to the snow. A multitude of neurons began firing inside Filch's
brain as realisation of what just happened dawned on him. The barrage
of swearwords that exploded from his mouth could be heard all the way
to Hagrid's hut."I
think Filch has just cottoned on," said Fred as the two boys
suddenly started to walk quicker up the stairs just in case the
caretaker came chasing
after them, they didn't slow down until they were in the relative
safety of the Gryffindor common room."Are
you guys done already?" asked Lee looking up from a table. He had a
couple of books spread out over them and had his quill poised over a
parchment."Filch
is finishing up for us," said George causing his friend to frown in
confusion. "We'll tell you later. What are you doing?""Starting
my Herbology homework," replied Lee pointing at the book."I
thought we had decided on checking if Percy had kept his old essays,"
said George flicking Lee's book shut."You
were serious about that?""Yeah
why wouldn't we be?" said Fred. "All we need it a way to
distract Percy for a few minutes while we search his room.""Like
that is going to happen," said Lee shaking his head. "The moment
either of you try to distract him, he'll know something is up.""That
is true," said George thoughtfully. His sentence trailed off as he
saw his older brother coming down the stairs from the dormitories.
"You off out Percy?""Not
that it is any of your business but no," said the prefect crossing
over the room to the Gryffindor bulletin board. He pinned a small
piece of parchment to it. "Just updating the passwords for the Fat
Lady for the next few weeks.""We
were actually just talking about you," advised Fred thinking
quickly."You
were?" replied Percy looking between his two brothers suspiciously.
"I don't have any money for you to borrow.""We're
not after money," laughed George failing to lower his brother's
state of alertness. "It's just Lee here thinks he could have a
good shot at being the Gryffindor prefect in a couple of years, now
obviously neither Fred or I would know anything about what it would
take to become one but you certainly would.""You
would?" asked Percy transferring his suspicious gaze to the twins'
friend."Oh
yeah," nodded Lee quickly after getting a sly kick in the shin from
George. "My dad was a prefect as was my granddad, so it's a big
deal for them that I'm one as well. Do you have any tips that would
help me get picked? I mean, what did you do for instance?""Well
there's no one thing that you need to do, it's more to do with
your general attitude. Now, there are some
people, who are completely unsuited to the responsibilities of being
a prefect," at this point Percy looked pointedly at his two
brothers. "And by associating yourself with them you have probably
made it difficult to be in consideration for the title, but I'm
sure with a few adjustments you'll be back on track.""This
sounds like it could take a while," said Fred heading towards the
stairs. "We'll just leave you to it.""That'll
probably be for the best," said Percy not looking up. He reached
for a spare piece of parchment and took the quill off Lee. "We'll
need to write all this down; they'll be a lot to remember.""Really?
That's great," said Lee looking over Percy's shoulder to flash
an expression of annoyance at the twins. They just gave him a
friendly wave and headed up the stairs."Was
that too mean to Lee?" said Fred as the two boys quickly headed up
the stairs."He's
taking one for the team," concluded George following closely behind
his brother.They
made their way up to Percy's dormitory and headed inside. It had
changed little over the last couple of years since the twins had
snuck inside to brew a potion in secret in their first year. There
was only one occupant in the room and Fred was about to launch into a
quickly formulated excuse for their presence but then realised he
recognised the individual."Oliver?"
Fred said uncertainly looking at what seemed to be a bundle of
bedding."Urrgh,"
groaned the mound on the bed. It slowly rolled onto one side and the
face of the Gryffindor captain could be seen poking out of the top of
the bunched duvet, his nose and eyes were bright red and his skin was
pale and pasty looking."Merlin's
Beard you look awful," muttered Fred unable to keep the shock out
of his voice."I'm
fine," mumbled Oliver before letting out a hacking cough."Oh
yeah, you sound just peachy," replied George looking around the
room. "Which bed is Percy's?""That
one over there," came the muted response. Oliver jutted a foot out
of the bottom of the bed and used it to point in the direction of
their older brother's bed."Cheers,"
said George heading towards it."So
what's wrong with you? Shouldn't you be in the infirmary?"
asked Fred as his brother began rummaging through Percy's
possessions."I'm
fine, nothing wrong with me at all, just picked up a little cold from
the weather," explained Oliver from his warm cocoon. "Madam
Pompfrey says there is nothing she can do. Honestly, she can grow
bones back but can't cure a simple cold; it's ridiculous I tell
you.""I
take it that this afternoon's practice is cancelled?" said Fred
as George began pulling out the drawers next to Percy's bed.Although
each student was only allocated one set of drawers and a wardrobe to
stow their belongings, the furniture had been enchanted to allow far
more items to be placed inside them than the outward appearance would
suggest. George found himself leaning halfway into one of the drawers
so that only the bottom half of his body was visible."Aha!"
he exclaimed his voice echoing from inside the wooden furniture. He
pulled himself out and held aloft an armful of paper all neatly held
in place with string wrapped around it. George looked down at it and
read from the first page. "Damn, second year stuff," he
disappeared back into the drawer."Why
would practice be cancelled?" demanded Oliver, struggling to sit
up. "Has Slytherin tried to steal our timeslot again, I booked the
pitch weeks ago.""Calm
down, no they haven't," said Fred folding his arms across his
chest. "I just meant you aren't exactly in the best shape to be
holding a practice.""What
do you mean? I told you, I'm fine," Oliver devolved into a fit of
coughs that prevented him from elaborating further."Look
at your eyes, they're streaming, you won't be able to see a thing
out there, and it's cold, unless you are planning on taking your
duvet up on the broom with you of course," Fred pointed out."Ha,
got them," said George holding up the pile of paper which too both
hands to manage."But
we need to practice," complained Oliver letting out a huge sneeze
that reverberated around the room."I'll
tell you what Oliver," said Fred taking half of the pages from his
brother who had struggled across the room with them. "You rest up
and the rest of us will have practice as normal.""You
will?""Of
course we will Oliver," said George smiling kindly. "We all take
Quidditch as seriously as you do. Don't you worry about it.""Thanks
guys," sighed Oliver collapsing back down into the bed."We
aren't really still going to have practice are we? It's
freezing," said Fred in the corridor outside of the dormitory."Don't
be silly, I don't know about you but I'll be staying in with a
nice warm cup of tea. I doubt the rest of the team will complain much
either," said George."What
on earth is all of this?" asked Fred lifting up the parchments in
his hand. "I thought we were just trying to find one essay.""There
was too much to go through in there," said George balancing the
pages awkwardly in his hand. "But these were all from his third
year; one of them is bound to be on Invisible Creeping Cacti.""Hey
this one is about the Giant Treaties," said Fred looking down at
the top page of his pile. "Binns set that as homework last week,
and check it out; Percy got two hundred and twelve percent.""You
know what? I don't think we'll get a low mark again," said
George grinning.





--------




Filch opened his eyes as his alarm clock wailed into life, usually such a noise would been an unwelcome interruption to his delightful dreams of punishments for students but today however was a special day indeed. It was the last day before the Christmas holidays officially started, which meant he got to watch as the majority of the children disappear off down to Hogsmeade station carried away by the horseless carriages. In the caretaker's opinion the only day in the entire scholastic calendar that was better was the final day of year when once again he would be given back a student free school."Good morning Mrs Norris," he said to his pet cheerily. He flicked the sheets back on his bed, swung his legs across and practically leaped out onto the ground. There were a few moments of uncertain dancing from the caretaker as he once again forgot that the cold winter months in conjunction with the stone floor made for a very unpleasantly freezing feeling against his feet.Eventually he managed to locate his slippers and began his daily ritual of washing and shaving, although this time he was happily humming a tune to himself as he did. He dabbed his face dry with a towel that had once been white but had since discoloured to a murky yellow after years of neglect and gazed at himself in the mirror. There were a few errant strands of hair poking out of the top of his head which he tried to force down with his hand, after a few unsuccessful attempts he spat into his palm and used the moisture to wet them down so that they stuck to the rest of his lank dishevelled mane.Once his was suitably dressed he strode out of his room and into the corridors of the school. As he made his way through the various hallways and passages, he found that he was still humming the little happy tune to himself as he went.He wandered into the main entrance hall of the school and smiled to himself as he watch student after student filtering out of the door to board a carriage. He felt as if he could spend all day just watching them go."Alright Mr Filch?" asked George as he, Fred and Lee made their way down the stairs each one carrying a bag over their shoulders."Don't say anything," said Filch holding his hand out to stop them from speaking before waving them away. "You'll ruin the moment, just keep moving.""I'm not sure if I've ever seen Filch in such a good mood," said Lee as the three boys made their way out to the front of the school. Outside people were already queuing to get on the horseless carriages that would take them to Hogsmeade station and the Hogwarts' Express. "It's a little unnerving.""Everything about Filch is a little unnerving," corrected Fred handing Lee the bag that had been slung over his shoulder before massaging his arm with his hand. "Here you go.""Cheers, thanks for helping me down with these," said Lee taking the other bag from George as well."No problem, we weren't going to just standby and watch you struggle with these all the way down here," said George waving a hand at the bags now weighing down his friend."Er… except that you did, for a little bit anyway," Lee reminded him."Well it was funny at first, watching you try and balance yourself with all three while trying to get down the stairs, but after a while it just started being a bit sad," said Fred shrugging his shoulders or at least trying to with the bags weighing them down."Alright guys?" said Alicia as she and Angelina joined the group. She looked at Lee attempting to carry his three large bags. "You're only going home for a couple of weeks, why are you taking so much stuff?""Because, I'm being smart," said Lee eventually managing to find his balance. "These bags are filled with the things that I won't need after the holidays. So if I bring them home now then I won't need to struggle bringing them down at the end of the year.""But you wouldn't struggle bringing them down at the end of the year anyway," said Angelina frowning as she looked at the boy. "The House-Elves always put our stuff on the train, remember? We just leave them in our room.""Oh yeah," muttered Lee looking a little taken aback. He gazed at his bags forlornly before looking up at the twins. "I don't suppose…""No chance, we helped you down with them, we're not going back up as well," said George quickly as he shook his head."Besides, we're going to head into Hogsmeade for a few hours," said Fred nodding the direction of the village."Are you allowed?" asked Alicia."Well we assumed we are since we're third years and technically we are on holiday," said George."Yes but did someone say you could actually go?" reiterated the girl."Oh we didn't ask anyone if we could go or not," said Fred frowning."Yeah, they might have said no," agreed George."And that would have stopped you would it?" asked Lee."No, but it would have meant we would have had to sneak out, this way we get to enjoy the fresh air and a nice walk as opposed to crawling through a tunnel for the best part of an hour," explained Fred."I'm amazed that you two haven't been expelled yet," said Angelina shaking her head. One of the numerous horseless carriages pulled up in front of them. Lee grudgingly pushed his bags inside before stepping up into it."They would never do that," said Fred shaking his head. "This place would be boring without us.""Or at the very least, quieter and less likely to explode," conceded Alicia following Lee up into the carriage. Angelina climbed up after her. The three of them poked their heads out."See you after the holidays," said Angelina."Have a good Christmas," bade Alicia."Don't set fire to my bed," added Lee as the carriage pulled away by itself."See you too. Have a good Christmas as well. And I can't promise anything about your bed," said Fred and George, waving their friends off, before heading towards the path down to the village.The snow had left a thick blanket of soft white unspoiled canvas that the twins promptly destroyed as they stomped their way down to Hogsmeade. The village had entered into the full swing of festive spirit and not single a house or business was bereft of decorations. Lights, candles, Christmas trees and tinsel could be seen in every window along the way. As they approached the main street they could hear carols being sung with hearty gusto by miniature figurine singers attached to the side of each of the builders.The boys headed straight for their usual first stop in the village; Zonko's toyshop, where they replenished their stocks of dungbombs, stinkpellets, and other various items that could be found on Filch's list of items banned from the school grounds. After that a quick stop over at Honeyduke's sweetshop enabled them to pick up a few snack items that couldn't be found in the kitchens at Hogwarts.Eventually they headed to the warmth and comfort of the Three Broomsticks. The heat from the well stocked fire of the pub was enough to make the two boys instantly start removing their bulky coats, hats and gloves as they stepped through the door.The pub was relatively quiet without the usual hustle and bustle of the Hogwarts' students and the two boys quickly scanned the room for a suitable place to sit. Fred nudged his brother with his elbow and nodded towards the bar where a familiar face was being served by Madam Rosmerta."I haven't seen you in here for a long time Mr Filch," said the barmaid pouring out a glass of Fire Whiskey for the caretaker. "Not since the summer in fact.""I normally drink up at the Hog's Head during term time," advised Filch taking a sip of the golden liquid and letting out a satisfied sigh."How come?""Can you hear that?" asked Filch raising a hand to his ear theatrically."Hear what?""Exactly. Silence. No snot-nosed kids running around like they own the place," said Filch smiling to himself. "And even better than that, they have gone home for the holidays.""Who's 'they'?" asked Madam Rosmerta."The red headed doppelganger devils," whispered Filch leaning close to the woman. His face screwed up in disgust. "Those Weasley troublemakers.""Er… Mr Filch?" said the barmaid flicking her eyes across to where the twins were standing. Fred gave her a wave."Two weeks, two whole weeks without those permanent thorns in my side," said Filch gleefully."Mr Filch?" said Rosmerta again."I'll be free to head into a room without first having to check that they haven't stuck something above the door, poised to drop down onto me as I enter," Filch sighed as he took another sip from his glass. "I haven't been this relaxed in months.""Argus?" said the barmaid, this time sounding much firmer."What?" asked Filch looking slightly annoyed as he took a large gulp of his drink. Madam Rosmerta nodded towards the boys. The caretaker turned to look where she was pointing. There was a sudden spray of liquid erupting from his mouth like a fountain. He waved a finger at the twins. "You!""Hiya Mr Filch," said George beaming a wide smile at the caretaker. He turned to look at the barmaid. "Two Butterbeers if you don't mind Madam Rosmerta.""W-w-what are you…? You can't be…? Why aren't you…?" stammered Filch unable to get any of his questions out of his mouth. Eventually he managed to compose himself enough to say one complete sentence. "But you're supposed to be on the train.""No we aren't," said Fred frowning. Madam Rosmerta placed two glasses of warm Butterbeer onto the bar. "Thanks.""Yes you are," state Filch firmly. "I saw you, you had your bags.""Oh those?" said George taking a large gulp of his drink. "Those were Lee's bags, we were just helping him.""So you aren't heading home for the holidays?" asked Filch in an extremely pathetic voice. "You're staying at Hogwarts?""Yeah our parents are visiting our brother," said Fred mistakenly thinking that the caretaker was trying to engage them in conversation. "So we're stuck here for the holidays.""Here Mr Filch, I think you could do with another one of these. On the house," said Madam Rosmerta pouring out another glass of Fire Whiskey. Without changing his expression, Filch reached a hand out, grasped the glass and drained it all in one go. He looked across at the woman forlornly."I thought I had two weeks away from them," he muttered to her. Almost in a daze he stepped away from the bar and headed towards the door of the pub. A chilly blast of air whipped through the room as he left and made his way out in the cold."Well I for one am always glad to see you," said Madam Rosmerta giving the boys a wink before going to serve a customer further down the bar."He's slipping," said George shaking his head."He's getting old," agreed Fred drinking from his glass. "How far do you think he'll get before he realises that we are out of school grounds?""I'd say definitely within the next three seconds," said George looking out of the window to where the caretaker had suddenly stopped in his tracks.Filch burst back through the door of the Three Broomsticks with a malevolent and slightly demented look in his eye. He jabbed a finger towards the two boys."Out of bounds!" he exclaimed advancing on them. Fred and George tried to consume as much of their Butterbeers as they could before the caretaker grabbed their collars roughly and propelled them through the door."Don't worry, I'll put those on your tab," Madam Rosmerta called after them as she went to collected the unpaid glasses of Butterbeer discarded on the bar top."I've got you this time," snarled Filch pushing Fred along in front of him. The boy stumbled slightly as he tried to regain his footing. "Not just out of bounds, but sneaking into Hogsmeade as well.""We didn't sneak into Hogsmeade," countered George as both he and Fred tried to keep ahead of the man."I just caught you. Even in the face of facts you are going to lie," snapped Filch angrily."We didn't sneak anywhere," explained Fred. "We just walked into the village normally. There are no rules against that.""Of course there are rules against that!" shouted Filch as he threw his hands in the air. "If there weren't any rules against it, you lot could just wander into the village whenever you feel like it.""We do wander into the village whenever we feel like it," George pointed out. "Therefore there can't be any rules against it.""What?" said Filch suddenly taken aback by the boy's logic. "No, it doesn't work like that. You don't get to decide on the rules.""But you said so yourself, if there weren't any rules against it, we could just wander into the village any time. Since we do that then there can't be any rules against it," said Fred turning and walking backwards as he explained the concept to the caretaker. "It's pretty simple really.""No," retorted Filch waving a finger at the two boys. "You aren't going to weasel your way out of it this time. I've caught you, out of bounds, and I'm going to make sure that you two are punished harshly for this. I've been telling Dumbledore since you two first turned up that you needed to be expelled and this time he'll have no choice. Flouting the rules, you have no respect for authority. And what's in those bags you are carrying? Are those from Zonko's? Give them here."Filch peered into the contents of the paper bags each of the boys had been carrying. His face broke into a wide smile."Dungbombs? Stinkpellets? They're on the banned list. Oh my you're going to be expelled for sure now, trying to bring illegal contraband onto school premises," said the caretaker practically giddy with excitement. He looked up to see a lone figure approaching around the bend in the road. His smile managed to increase a few notches once he realised it was Dumbledore. "I don't even have to wait to see you expelled. Headmaster.""Ah Argus how are you doing on his fine day? Mr Weasleys," said the headmaster nodded at the two boys."I caught them sir," Filch said triumphantly."Caught who?" asked Dumbledore looking around."These two miscreants," said Filch waving a hand towards the twins."Caught them doing what exactly?""Being out of bounds of course," stated Filch."Argus, while I do appreciate you diligently enforcing the numerous and exhaustive list of school rules that have built up over the years, I do feel that since it is officially the Christmas holidays and the fact that as third years these two young men are allowed into Hogsmeade on occasion anyway, we can certainly overlook their indiscretion this one instance," said Dumbledore smiling slightly. "Now, unless you are busy Argus, how about you join me for a glass of Fire Whiskey or two down at Rosmerta's?""B-but…" stammered Filch for a few seconds before he realised he was still holding the paper bags from Zonko's, he rallied superbly and held them open for Dumbledore to see. "What about these?""Oh really Argus, you shouldn't have," said Dumbledore looking inside the bags."I didn't get them for you," explained Filch. He pointed an accusing finger at the twins. "They bought them.""While it is very generous of you two, I don't think I can accept presents from my students," said Dumbledore looking at the boys kindly. "There could be a suggestion of favouritism and I try to avoid that as best as I can. However I do appreciate the gesture.""That's quite all right sir," said George. He held his hand out to take the bags from Filch. "I'm sure we'll be able to find someone that would want them.""These are banned at the school," said Filch still holding onto the items."That is true Argus," nodded Dumbledore. "And I'm sure neither of these fine young gentlemen were planning on bringing them onto school grounds. Were you?""Oh no sir," said Fred looking affronted at such a suggestion. "We would never bring something to the school that was on the banned list.""Very good," smiled Dumbledore turning to look at the caretaker. "I think that should be enough to waylay any reservations you may have.""Right," said Filch tersely. Reluctantly he held the bags out for George to take."Excellent, now that has been resolved, how about that drink Argus?" said Dumbledore rubbing his hands together eagerly."I could do with a drink," sighed Filch shaking his head. "Or twelve.""Very good," said Dumbledore resting a hand on the caretaker's shoulder and guiding him towards the village. He looked over his shoulder as he left. "Gentlemen.""Bye sir," said George giving the headmaster a wave."We aren't really going to not bring them into the school," said Fred."Of course not," said George once he had mentally worked his way through his brother's statement. "Although I think we will probably have to come back here tomorrow to get some more.""How come?""Because we have two bags full of the likes of dungbombs and stinkpellets, and Filch's office will be unguarded for the next while.""You truly are an evil man George, and I like it," said Fred smiling."'Tis the season Fred, tis the season."

Chapter 17"Merry Christmas!" bellowed George, as he lifted his pillow over his head and brought it down onto Fred's face. "Where's my present?""Oi watch it," said Fred, throwing his arms across him to protect against the blows."Give me my present," said George, not showing any signs of ceasing his attacks."Okay, okay, okay," Fred shouted, until his brother stopped tormenting him. He leaned out of the bed and fished his hand underneath until he pulled out a poorly wrapped box. He held it up to his brother."Thanks. Yours is there," said George, nodding towards Fred's bedside table where an equally poorly wrapped box was balanced."Nice one," said Fred. The two boys sat down on their respective beds. They ripped open their presents in a blur of fingers and wrapping. Fred discarded the paper and held up a bag of what looked like small false teeth. "Chattering Teeth. How did you know?""Lucky guess?" said George who had unwrapped his present from George and was now also the proud owner of his own bag of Chattering Teeth. He opened the top of the bag, pulled one out and held it up to his mouth. "Hello there.""Hello there," replied the teeth mimicking George's voice but in a slightly higher pitch."Brilliant," said George throwing the teeth down onto the floor where it began slowly moving around the room all the while repeating the phrase over and over.Fred took out a set of teeth from his own bag and placed it on the floor next to George's."Hello there," said George's teeth."Hello there," repeated Fred's set."Hello there.""Hello there.""That is going to get very annoying, very quickly," said Fred, looking down at the teeth."I know," said George, nodding his head. "Shall we put some of them in Percy's room?""What else would we do with them?" said Fred, shrugging his shoulders. There was a small pile of presents at the end of his bed, he put the bag of teeth to one side and started tearing into the gifts.Once the flurry of present opening was over the twins were left with a set each of dried Mummy-Eye marbles, (sent by their brother Bill), a Dragon-Tooth necklace (from Charlie), Chocolate Frogs (Ginny), a book on wizard etiquette (Percy, of course), a Muggle watch (Mr Weasley) and home-made biscuits (Mrs Weasley). There was one present they each left to last to open since they already knew what was contained inside. Without fail for as long as either of them could remember Mrs Weasley had knitted each of her children a nice warm, and often brightly coloured, jumper. This year theirs were blue."You have to wonder why she puts letters on them," said Fred, pulling on his jumper. "It's not like we're going to forget who they're for.""I know, and even if we got them mixed up it's not as if we don't wear each other's clothes every now and again," agreed George, putting his own one on."Wait, what? You borrow my clothes?""Yeah, all the time," said George, frowning. "Don't you?""No. Hang on, is that why I never have any clean clothes lying around? Because you're taking them.""Borrow, the word is 'borrow'," George said, correcting his brother. "And yes.""I thought I was just losing them. Well in the interest of borrowing, I'm sure you won't mind." Fred crossed over to George's wardrobe, opened one of the drawers and took out a pair of underwear which he then put on before grabbing his trousers. "What? I'm only borrowing them.""Oh no, that's fine, you can borrow what you like from that drawer since it's actually for my dirty clothes," said George, pointing at the wardrobe.One quick change of clothes later, along with a barrage of complaining from Fred, the twins exited their dormitories and headed up to see their brother Percy. When they found that he was not in his room they decided to find their younger brother Ron instead, though not before hiding the two Chattering Teeth in Percy's bedside cabinet. Downstairs they found Ron and Harry in the middle of opening their presents. As usual their brother had been given a maroon coloured jumper while to the twin's surprise Harry had also been given a light green one by their mother."Harry's is better than ours though," said Fred, holding up the boy's jumper. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.""Why aren't you wearing yours Ron," George demanded. He picked it up from the floor and threw it over to his brother. "Come on, get it on. They're lovely and warm.""I hate maroon," muttered Ron, pulling the jumper over his head."You haven't even got a letter on yours," George observed, pointing at Ron's chest. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid, we know we're called Gred and Forge.""What's all this noise?"Percy stuck his head through the door, with a disapproving look on his face. He was carrying his own knitted jumper over his arm."P for prefect! Get it on, Percy," ordered Fred, grabbing hold of the jumper. "Come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.""I… don't… want…" complained Percy, as the twins force the jumper down over his head and knocking his glasses awry."And you're not sitting with the prefects today either," said George. "Christmas is a time for family." And with that the twins frogmarched Percy from the room with his arms pinned to his side by his jumper."Will you let me go?" complained Percy, trying his best to free his arms. "This is not dignified.""Dignified? No. Necessary? No. Funny? Definitely," said Fred, as the twins propelled their brother through the Common Room door and out into the hallway."Where are you taking me?" demanded Percy."The Great Hall," said George."But Christmas Dinner isn't for hours," said Percy."Yeah but breakfast is now," said Fred, patting his stomach."I've already had breakfast.""You have?" said George, as the twins stopped in their tracks."Yes," said Percy, struggling to put his arms into the sleeves of his jumper."When?""At six o'clock, like I do every morning," said Percy, finally managing to put his jumper on correctly."So why are you coming down to breakfast with us if you've already eaten?" asked Fred, frowning."I wa…" said Percy before being cut off by his brother."Really Percy there's no need to be greedy," said George, shaking his head in disgust. "No wonder you had trouble getting that jumper on.""I'm not… I didn't… I…" Percy floundered for a moment. "Sometimes I hate you two.""Ah don't say that Percy," said Fred, as the older boy turned around and headed back towards Gryffindor House."You know you love us really," called George. Without turning around Percy made a gesture with his hand. "Percy!""How rude," said Fred."Some people have no class."There were very few people in the Great Hall since the bulk of the children had gone home for the holidays while most of those that had stayed at the school had elected to remain in their nice warm beds. The twins helped themselves to large bowlfuls of steaming hot porridge and chatted loudly across the room with the other children sitting on different House tables. They were soon joined by Ron and Harry, who were sporting their new, rather fetching, jumpers."So when do they serve lunch?" asked Ron, hungrily digging into his breakfast."You're thinking about lunch already?" asked George, looking down at his brother's bowl which was rapidly being emptied with each spoonful."Just wondering about it," said Ron, sending a short spray of porridge across the table."It's usually at the same time as lunch normally," said Fred, shrugging his shoulders. "Except it goes on much longer and there is so much food you'll probably need someone to roll you back to Gryffindor House.""Well as much as we'd like to sit here and jabber on all day," said George, pushing his bowl away and swinging his legs around on the bench, "we've got places to go.""People to see," added Fred, slapping Harry before standing up himself."Things to explode," said George."See you later," said Fred, as the pair left the Great Hall. Outside he rubbed his hands together. "Right, where shall we go?""Hmm you know I'm not too sure. We could always…" George paused midsentence. He had a strange feeling they were being watched. He turned around. "Oh hi Mr Filch.""Don't 'hi' me," snapped Filch, wagging a finger at the boy."Okay, hello Mr Filch," said George, correcting himself."Don't 'hello' me either.""What about 'wotcha'? Or 'how's it going'?" said George, rubbing his chin as he mused."I always liked 'top of the morning'," said Fred."I never really understood that, surely if you are saying it as a greeting then it should be 'bottom of the morning' since you always start at the bottom," said George with a frown on his face."Not with ice-cream cones, you can't start at the bottom with ice-cream cones. It would all melt out of the hole the moment you bit into the cone," reasoned Fred."Is that what that saying is about? Ice-cream cones?" said George, looking rather impressed at his brother's extensive knowledge on old sayings. "But you say 'morning', top of the morning. Who has ice-cream in the morning?""I would if I could," said Fred, shrugging."Actually so would I. Raspberry ripple, with sprinkles, you've got to have sprinkles.""And chocolate sauce.""Well the chocolate sauce goes without saying. It's implied.""Do you remember that ice-cream we had a few years back at cousin Aphelia's wedding? Now that was a good ice-cream.""Should we go and see if the House-Elves will make us some?""I think it would be rude not too," said Fred, looking serious. "You want to some Mr Filch?""No I don't want any bloody ice-cream," shouted Filch, who had spent the last couple of minutes slowly getting redder and redder."I know what you mean, who wants strawberry sauce on their ice-cream," said George. "Charlie always puts that on his. It's horrible stuff.""What in Merlin's Beard are you wittering on about?" said Filch, looking confused."Bloody ice-cream. You know? Strawberry sauce. It's what Charlie calls it. He used to try and pretend he was pouring Dragon's blood onto his ice-cream but we always knew it was strawberry sauce. Except Ron, he believed him.""To be fair though you have been telling Ron that Charlie was a vampire since he was about six years old," said Fred, looking at his brother with professional admiration."Now that was a good lie. I still can't believe he fell for it. Remember when we convinced him that Charlie was gonna bite him and turn him into a vampire on his ninth birthday?""Yeah," said Fred, grinning at the memory. "He locked himself in his room with a two dozen bags of garlic and rubbed them all over his body. He stunk for weeks.""It was brilliant," said George. "Sorry Mr Filch, what were we talking about?""Talking? We weren't talking," said Filch, glad to get the conversation back on track. "We don't talk. I tell you what to do and you do it.""That's right, and you want us to get you some ice-cream. No red sauce, only chocolate," said George, staring at the caretaker for confirmation of his order."No I don't want ice-cream," snapped Filch, spitting slightly in anger. "I want you two to know, that there are only a few dozen students staying at Hogwarts over Christmas and of those only about five have caused me any trouble and over those five you two are the worst.""Ah thanks," said Fred, pretending to be bashful."It's not a competition," snarled Filch."But if it was, we would be the winners right?" asked George, hopefully."What it means is that until term starts again, and all those other miscreants return, the only ones I'm going to be concentrating on are you two. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting for you to slip up," said Filch, waving his finger at the two boys. "And when you do…""What?" said Fred, after a few seconds."Stupid as well as lazy are you?" demanded Filch, taking delight at talking down to the boys. "I thought I explained what was going to happen in short simple terms.""Oh I got that part. You're going to follow us around blah blah blah," said Fred, waving a hand dismissively. "What I meant was, 'and when you do'… what?""What?" said Filch, frowning."Exactly," said Fred, nodding encouragement at the man."What are you talking about?""Well you said 'and when you do'. And then you left a dramatic pause but you never finished what you were saying.""Just get out of my sight," shouted Filch, angrily."Righto Mr Filch," said Fred, snapping off a quick salute."What did you decide about the ice-cream?" asked George."Get out of here," bellowed Filch."All right, all right," said George, hurrying away after his brother. "He can be so touchy.""Don't worry Mrs Norris," muttered Filch to his pet cat, which was now weaving its way between his legs. "We'll get them this year." Mrs Norris purred her approval at this statement. After a few seconds of silence the caretaker's stomach grumbled. "Do you fancy some ice-cream?"Filch was true to his word and spent the next couple days hounding the twins. Every time they stepped out of Gryffindor Tower they would find the caretaker, or his beloved cat, waiting to follow them wherever they went. Worse was that he kept such a close distance to them that they found it next to impossible to disappear down any of the secret corridors that they would usually use to escape from the Filch. The presence of the caretaker outside Gryffindor House didn't stop the twins leaving as much as the cold weather. Inside the Tower it was warm and cosy, in the rest of the castle it was teeth shatteringly freezing so Fred and George spent much of their time inside and would only venture out when their stomach demanded a snack.It was definitely weird having a dormitory room that normally housed five boys now only containing two but Fred and George found that they rather liked the new arrangements. It went from being a room they had to share to their own room, and since it was their own room they decided that they could do whatever they wanted with it. The first thing they did was to manoeuvre the beds and chairs around the room in a circle and took it in turns to try and run around the room jumping on to each bed and chair in turn without touching the ground. After several laps they realised that it was far too easy so tried to devise more and more complicated ways of completing the task."Okay it's about four feet in front of you," said Fred, as he watched his brother prepare to jump from a chair onto one of the beds with a blindfold on while hopping on one foot. Fred thought the he probably only stood a fifty-percent chance of succeeding and even then he was being generous."Right," said George. He swung his arms back and forth a few times before crouching low. He jumped. Fifty-percent chance was definitely being generous. Although he managed to get enough lift to make the jump to the bed, the blindfold made if much more difficult to stick the landing and he found himself flopping forward onto the mattress and bouncing across before landing haphazardly on the floor. George pushed the blindfold up onto his forehead with one hand while he nursed a painfully bruised shoulder with another. "That could have gone better.""Next time when you land bend your knees," advised Fred, who was lying on his bed with the Marauders' Map open in front of him. "And maybe don't topple forward quite so much. It might be an idea not to scream like a girl either.""Your turn," said George, throwing the blindfold over to his brother."Nah, you're alright," said Fred pulling up one of the legs of his trousers. There was a nasty looking red mark across his shin which looked like it had started to bruise. "I think I'll try and recover from this first. You have another go.""I think I'll pass," said George, still massaging his arm. "Any joy?""No, Filch is still there," said Fred, shaking his head. The only way the twins were able to leave Gryffindor House, and be sure that the caretaker would not follow them around the building, was to keep their eye on the Marauders' Map and wait for Filch to nip away for some food or to use the toilet. Fred sat forward. "Wait. Forget that. It looks like he is moving. Yes, he's moving. Okay we don't have much time."The twins sprung into action. George rushed over to their wardrobes, picked out a coat and thick jumper for each of them while Fred pulled out a small backpack from underneath his bed. George put on his clothes and threw the other set towards his brother who caught them deftly in one hand. As his brother put on his jumper and coat, George swung the backpack over his shoulder, wiped the Marauder's Map clean, rolled up the parchment and put it into his pocket. The twins headed out of their dormitory, grabbing a woollen hat each as they left. They rushed down the stairs, through the empty Common Room and out of the door of Gryffindor House. It had taken roughly sixty-seconds from Filch leaving his post to the twins stepping out into the hallway."This way," said George quickly, pointing down the corridor towards the closest secret passageway. Fred took out his wand and tapped the frame of the old painting three times. With a faint click it slowly opened and the two boys rushed inside and pulled it shut behind them."Right, time to cause some mischief," said George, smiling in the darkness.

"The Forbidden Forrest, in the middle of the night, in the freezing cold," said Fred, as he and his brother made their way between the trees. "Remind me again why this is a good idea?""Because Filch is up in the school so it leaves the whole Forest free for us to mess around in.""That's how we were able to get here not why we are actually here. If I wanted to be cold I'm pretty sure I could have done that in the castle.""That's true, but do you know what you couldn't do up in the castle?" said George turning around and walking backwards while he spoke to his brother."Watch you hit your head on that branch?" said Fred, nodding behind his brother."What? Ow," said George, who had turn around in time to smack his forehead off the low hanging branch. The cold weather made it hurt much more than it would have normally. He rubbed his head with his hand. "No, I meant what we couldn't do up at the castle is watch the Centaurs take part in their annual Winter Solstice Ceremony. Apparently it's pretty amazing.""Pretty amazing?" asked Fred sceptically. "What does it involve?""Well there's a big fire…""That'll do for me," said Fred, rubbing his hands together.The twins continued to trek into the dark of the forest. The school had long disappeared from their vision, although the thickness of the trees had more to do with that rather than the distance they had travelled. Both boys had their wands illuminated to light the way as well as to potentially ward off any creatures that might be out looking for a night-time snack. Most people who ventured into the Forbidden Forest tended to employ a cautious approach and tried their best to remain silent. The twins were not most people."Hogwarts, Hogwarts, hoggy hoggy, Hogwarts, teach us something pleaaaaaasssseeee," bellowed Fred at the top of his voice."Warty," said George, cutting his brother off mid-flow."What?""It's 'Hogwarts, Hogwarts, hoggy warty, Hogwarts'," said George, correcting his brother."Are you sure?" said Fred. "I always thought it was hoggy hoggy.""That would make no sense," scoffed George."Hogwarts, Hogwarts, hoggy warty, Hogwarts," muttered Fred quietly to himself. "No, it just doesn't sound right.""You mean 'hoggy, hoggy' sounds right?""Fair enough. Quick question George," said Fred, stopping in his tracks. "Where in Merlin's Beard are we going?""Er… I'm not actually sure. We were supposed to just head directly east from the castle, and we'll pass a small stream, which we have, go through one large clearing, which we did, and just after two large fallen trees we should reach another clearing and that's where the ceremony will be taking place," said George, trying to recall the directions."How do you know all this?""It was in Enoch's letter," said George. He spotted the frown on his brother's face. "Did I not tell you we got a letter from him?""No, that must have slipped your mind," said Fred, shaking his head."Oh, well he was the one that suggested we take a look at the ceremony. Here you can read it for yourself," said George, reaching a hand into his pocket and taking out a folded piece of paper."You got this like last week," said Fred, as he read the letter."I've been busy," said George, shrugging."Well it sounds like a good idea, bit of dancing, some music… ooo Centaur food. I wonder what that is," said Fred, reading on. There was something nagging at the back of his mind which he couldn't quite place. He finished the letter and continued to stare at it for a while."Good grief, and I thought I was a slow reader," muttered George."I've finished reading it you idiot, there's just something about it that doesn't seem right," said Fred, looking for any clues as to what was unnerving him about the letter. His eyes were drawn to one word on the page in particular; it was the word 'definitely'. "Definitely, definitely. Here, look at the spelling of the word definitely. Does it seem wrong to you?""No, that's how you spell it," said George, examining the word under wandlight."That's my point. How many letters has Enoch sent us over the years? How many times has he spelt 'definitely' correctly? It's not just that word either, it's loads of them; experience, familiar, finally. They're all spelt correctly. And remember his last letter? It warned us that he was in trouble but this one doesn't even mention anything to do with that," said Fred, frowning. "There's no way he wrote this.""Well I had hope you would have got further into the forest but I suppose here is just a good a place as anywhere," said a voice behind them.Fred and George spun around quickly. Standing about thirty foot behind them was a figure dressed in dark robes. It was difficult to make out any more since the man had a cowl pulled up over his head while the light from his wand was too bright to see passed."Who are you?" demanded George, pointing his wand at the figure."Who I am isn't important," said the man."What are you doing here?" asked Fred."Me? I'm just taking a stroll through the forest," said the man in a casual manner. "I thought I might take in the Centaurs' Winter Solstice Ceremony. Apparently it's pretty amazing.""How did you know about… wait, it was you wasn't it? You wrote the letter," accused Fred."Guilty as charged," said the man, laughing slightly."Why?""Well your dear uncle Enoch was proving to be a rather awkward fellow to pin down. So I thought to myself 'what's the easiest way to capture something?' And I realised the answer was to make sure you have the right bait. And now I do. You two.""What do you want with Enoch?" asked Fred. The man had slowly begun walking towards them so the two boys were trying to back away without tripping over in the dark."Easy. To kill him.""What's he ever done to you?" snapped George, trying to sound far braver than he felt."Nothing, well apart from some choice insults when I thought I had him cornered a few months back. I'm not killing him because I want to; I'm killing him because someone wants him dead.""What's the difference?" asked Fred, stalling for time while he thought of a plan of escape."I'm not a common murderer dear boy; I'm a highly skilled assassin. Any idiot can be a murderer. Assassination is delicate and precise art form when done correctly. And I am one of the best when it comes to doing things correctly.""Look, whatever you are being paid…" began George. The man started to laugh."You'll double it? I doubt your pocket money would amount to much.""Shows what you know. We don't even get pocket money," said Fred, sneering at the man. He glanced over at his brother who was now looking at him and shaking his head. "What? It sounded good in my head.""What do you think we should do?" whispered George as quietly as he could."I think we should do what we always do," said Fred, shrugging."Fair enough.""So are you going to be good boys and come quietly? Or is this going to turn ugly?""Hey, we're just kids, we don't want any trouble," said Fred, holding out his hands up. "NOW!""Pertificus Totalis!" shouted George, aiming his wand towards the man."Furnuculus!" Fred fired his own spell at the target.Neither boy waited to see if their spells hit their mark. Instead they were already off running through the darkness trying their best not to trip. They kept running as hard as they could until they came to a small clearing."Wait," puffed George, slowing to a stop. Both he and his brother had extinguished the light from their wands but still kept them raised just in case. "Where are we? Which way is the school?""I think it's…" Fred tailed off as he looked around. "I have no idea.""Brilliant, we're lost with a nutjob after us.""And for once it isn't Filch," said Fred. He pointed towards one side of the clearing. "I say we go this way.""Why that way?""It's as good as any other way and it'll take us in the opposite direction of the nutjob," reasoned Fred."Should we try and get the attention of someone in the castle? Like sending up red sparks or something?""Who'll see it? Apart from the nutjob.""Well that was an enjoyable little jaunt through the woods," said the voice of the man who was now emerging from the trees. He held his wand lazily in one hand and if he hadn't previously indicated his nefarious intentions, it wouldn't have been out of place to assume he was just enjoying a leisurely nightly stroll through the forest."Expelliamus!" barked George quickly. His heart leaped as the man's wand shot forward before he could grip it in time. The boy caught it in his spare hand and held it aloft triumphantly. "Aha!""Nice one George," beamed Fred. He turned to address the man. "Who's the tough guy now then eh?""Oh I don't need a wand to be able to take care of a couple of children," said the man. His hand reached inside his robes and pulled out a long sharp and slightly curved knife."Hang on, you only have a knife, we're the ones with the wands," said George as the man began to slowly walk towards them."I'm quite aware of that. My point is it doesn't matter," said the man, continuing his approach."Stop right there or we're going to have to stop you ourselves," said Fred, raising his wand in a threatening manner."We mean it," stated George once it became apparent that the man had no intention of stopping. He looked over at his brother."We warned him," said Fred, shrugging.The two boys aimed their wands and each fired off a spell which hit the man square in the chest. Their celebrations were short lived when it became apparent that despite being struck by both spells, neither of them seemed to have had any effect on the man. Overcoming their initial surprised they once again fired off a spell each, and once again the man suffered no visible ill effects. Desperately trying one last time the twins fired off a whole barrage of spells one after the other in a non-stop attack that lasted about a minute and left them slightly out of breath when they finally stopped. The man was still standing in the same place and was now laughing at the ineffectual attacks."How?" it was the only word George could manage to force out against the rising panic he was now feeling.The man lifted his hands slowly up to the cowl shadowing his face and pushed it back. Fred managed to stifle his sharp intake of breath but George was unable to stop himself from swearing. The man was no man, he was… something else.Although he had similar features to a human; two eyes, nose, mouth, they were not completely normal. The eyes were perfectly round, much further apart than normal and seemed to be moving completely separately from each other. His nose was extremely thin with one nostril protruding on each side rather than at the bottom. His mouth held two rows of sharp looking teeth and a thick black tongue that matched the colour of his lips. His skin was made up of tiny green scales which, along with the rest of his features, made him look like an oversized chameleon."What is that?" said Fred, not entirely sure if he want to know the answer."Some kind of weird lizard man thing," ventured George."I'm a Kosa," said the man. A look of distain had crept onto his face after George's comment."I would say it's a pleasure to meet you A-Kosa, but you know the whole trying to kill us thing sort of gets in the way of being nice," said Fred sarcastically."I'm not trying to kill you, well not yet anyway," said the man, smirking. "And my name is Valek. Kosa is my species.""Is that supposed to mean something to us?" asked George. The twins had now more or less backed away the entire width of the clearing as they tried to keep some distance between themselves and Valek."I'm not surprised you don't know about my kind. As there so few of us left not many do. In fact I think I could very well be the last of my kind," said Valek, shrugging. "We were officially registered as extinct about a decade ago.""Well if this is how your people acted, I doubt they'd be missed much," said Fred. He looked over his shoulder to try and gauge how far it was to the tree line."Yes, we were never popular with you wizards. It could have been down to our different social structures, our desire to increase our political power amongst the other magical beings, or even our habit of accumulating wealth. But personally I think it was down to two very simple factors. One; we're naturally immune to magic, and two; we just really like killing things," said Valek. His black tongue snaked out and licked his lips as he smiled."How far away are the trees? I reckon we could lose him in there," whispered George."About another twenty foot or so," guessed Fred. "Just keep him talking a little longer and we'll be there.""I also happen to have very good hearing," said Valek, tapping the side of his head. "This is the last time I'll ask. Give yourselves up, or I will just kill you."Before either Fred or George could reply there was the sound of snapping twigs and rapid footsteps approaching from one side of the clearing. Valek had heard it too and stopped in his tracks with the curved blade held out in front of him. The twins were unsure where to aim their wands since there was a very good chance that whatever was coming could be just as dangerous as the Kosa. The sound grew louder and louder. They could make out something large and white making its way through the trees towards them. The creature leaped over a thicket of thistles and into the clearing. At first Fred and George thought it was just a horse which had escaped from the school stables but as it raced through the clearing they saw a single horn protruding from its forehead. It was the first time either of them had seen a unicorn and despite the situation they still marvelled at its beauty as it raced threw the glade towards the trees opposite.Valek snarled and began to move towards the twins again before a second sound stopped him once more. Fred expecting another unicorn started to back away towards the tree line while pulling his brother along with him by the arm. George tapped him on the shoulder and pointed. Following his brother's gaze Fred saw towards what he was gesturing. It wasn't a unicorn. It was a dark hooded figure.The figure turned to look at the twins. Although they couldn't make out its features both of them felt a chill run through their veins as its eyes fell on them. It slowly turned to look at the Kosa. Valek let out a long low pitched hiss and bared his teeth. There was a brief moment where when it looked as though he was about to attack the newcomer but instead gradually began moving away always making sure to keep the creature in sight."What do you think?" whispered George, trying to keep his voice as low as possible."I think that whatever that is," said Fred, pointing at the strange creature, "it's dangerous enough that Valek is scared of it. And he's immune to magic.""Do you think it's friendly?" George only had to look at his brother to guess his answer. "Fair enough, there's no need to make that face. Let's get out of here."The twins backed away to the safety of the tree line before turning tail and running as fast as their legs could carry them. They didn't dare look behind and both barrelled forward through the trees and the undergrowth leaving the clearing far behind them. After a good few minutes of running and several near falls they both finally stopped to catch their breaths."What was that thing?" said George, gasping for air."I haven't even heard of a Kosa before. Have you?""No, not Valek. The other thing.""No idea. It's the Forbidden Forest. There are hundreds of things in here that are far more dangerous than Valek," said Fred, waving his hand in the air."I really wish you hadn't said that while we are standing alone in the middle of the Forest.""Why not?""Because its one of those things you just don't say. Like 'everything will be fine' or 'nothing can go wrong' or 'this'll be the best Christmas those orphans will ever have'. The moment you say something like that then something bad always happens. And saying that there are hundreds of things in the Forest that are far more dangerous than an assassin who is immune to magic who wants to kill us instantly means that something is about to come out of the trees and attack us," said Fred, as his voice got more and more high-pitched. He held his wand out expecting an immediate onslaught from the darkness."So how long are we going to wait to be attacked?" asked George, after a few minutes."Well these things normally happen straight away as far as I know," said Fred, frowning."Right and since we weren't attacked straight away?""We're probably safe," said Fred, relaxing, although he still kept out his wand."Plonker," said George, shaking his head. "Any ideas where we are?""None. I think we might have moved even further away from the castle," said Fred. He looked up at the trees that surrounded them. "Maybe we could climb one of these and try and spot which way we should head.""Good luck with that," said George, slapping his brother on the back. "I'll wait down here.""Right," said Fred. He scratched his chin and looked at the nearest tree thoughtfully as he worked out the initial route he would climb.There was a snap of a twig in the dark.Fred span around and grabbed for his wand just as something shot out of the shadows and knocked him over onto the ground."Fred!" shouted George, pointing his wand at the creature."Fang! Bad boy!""Hagrid?" said George, as the school's groundskeeper came out of the darkness. George looked down at his brother and he realised the creature he was about to attack was actually Hagrid's pet dog which was enthusiastically licking Fred's face."What are you two doing here?" demanded Hagrid."About to drown," said Fred, covering his face as best as he could from the dog's slobber.

"So then what happened?" asked Lee, leaning forward in his chair. He and the twins were sitting in the comfy armchairs in the Gryffindor common room discussing the events over Christmas. Lee had only just arrived back from holiday before George had beckoned him over to the seats in front of the warm embracing fire."Hagrid dragged us back to the school," said Fred, tilting back in his chair and putting his feet up onto the small table in front of the three boys."I mean, what did the school do about that Valek guy?" said Lee, rolling his eyes. He saw Fred and George exchange shifty looks. "You did tell someone at the school about him didn't you?""Of course we did," scoffed George, dismissively."What do you take us for?" said Fred, shaking his head in disappointment."Who did you tell?" Lee had been around the twins long enough to know when they were being evasive."Well there's you…" said Fred, counting off on his fingers."And?""… er… and George.""So let me get this straight, there's this assassin who's immune to magic, and was going to kill you both, and you thought it would be a good idea to keep this a secret?""See there's a slight problem there," said George. "It seems that when it comes to telling the truth Fred and I aren't exactly the most… what's the word?""Honest?" ventured Lee."Exactly and we've sort of built up a reputation for… exaggerating," said Fred, finally settling on a suitable word."Is that another way of saying 'lying?" said Lee, raising an eyebrow."It's another way, it's not a polite way but it's definitely another way," conceded George."Look, if George and I came up to anyone else but you and told them that we'd been attack by that thing what do you think they'll say?""First they'd probably check the calendar to see if was April Fool's Day," admitted Lee, thoughtfully tapping his chin with his finger."Exactly," nodded Fred."Then they'd look around to see if anyone else was sniggering," carried on Lee."Right.""Then they'd probably check with someone else to see if there were any witnesses.""Precisely.""Then they'd probably check in the library to see if such a creature even exists.""Okay, we're getting a little off track now," said Fred."Actually what am I on about?" said Lee, shaking his head. "They wouldn't do any of that. They'd just assume you were lying.""Well, they might do some of it," said George indignantly. "We sometimes tell the truth. Can't actually think of anything recently but I'm sure we've done it.""Anyway, what are we going to do about it?" said Lee. "We have to tell someone. We can't let that thing stay out in the Forest, it might attack someone else. Or even try to get into the castle.""Nah, it wouldn't dare coming into the castle," said George, dismissively waving a hand."Why not? We had a troll get into the dungeons remember?""That was ages ago," snorted Fred."October, it was October," said Lee."Yeah but last year," said Fred. The expression on his friend's face was all the reply he needed. "Fine, we'll tell someone.""Right, who do we know that will not only believe us, but be able to help stop this Valek?" said George, rubbing his chin. After a few moments of silence he added, "don't all rush at once.""Well there's…" started Fred before lapsing into silence."Seriously, you can't think of anyone?" said Lee, looking astounded. "Really? No one jumps to mind?""If you mean you then I hate to break it to you but I don't think you'd be able to stop him anymore than we did," said George, trying to let his friend down gently."Not me you muppet. Enoch. You know, your uncle? Former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, explorer, adventure, and all round get-into-trouble-a-lot-person.""Of course," said Fred, slapping his forehead with his hand. "Why didn't we think of that? See, this is why you're part of the dream team Lee.""All round get-into-trouble-a-lot-person?" said George, pulling a face."What would you call him then?" queried Lee."Normally just Uncle Enoch covers most things," admitted George before clapping his hands together and rubbing them. "Right, we'll write a letter to Enoch letting him know what happened…""Wait," said Fred loudly, startling the others. "We can't""My handwriting's not that bad.""Well…" said Lee, frowning."It's better than yours," said George defensively."I don't mean that," said Fred. "Don't you remember what Valek said?""Which bit? The part about killing us, or the other part about killing us? Because that pretty much covers all the important bits of our meeting.""He was trying to use us as bait to kill Enoch," explained Fred. "If we write to him, he's going to come straight down here, and go looking for Valek, who'll have some trap waiting for him no doubt.""You're right," nodded George. "In fact, Valek is probably expecting us to write to Enoch. So we should do the exact opposite of what he's expecting.""Like get Enoch to write to us?" ventured Fred uncertainly."No," said George, shaking his head. "Like… actually I don't know.""Hang on. Valek knows we're going to write to Enoch," said Fred. "But…""Stop it," said Lee, letting out a long sigh."Stop what?" said Fred, frowning."You're going to say 'but we know he knows' and then George will say 'but he knows we know he knows' and then you'll add to that and you'll both go back and forth until you get confused," explained Lee."I wasn't going to say anything like that," sniffed Fred haughtily."Oh, sorry, I just thought… you know, it doesn't matter, I'm sorry. What were you going to say?""Er… well, you see… he knows but we know he knows," said Fred."Stop it right now," said Lee quickly, before George could follow up."Oh come on, it's traditional," complained Fred."Fine, just get it over with," said Lee."But surely he knows we know he knows," said George, taking up his cue."Ah, but we know he knows we know he knows, you know?" said Fred triumphantly."Is that enough? Are you done?""Well I thought we had one more round in it to be honest but we'll call it quits," admitted George."Great, so are we writing to Enoch or not?" asked Lee, trying to steer his friends back on track."The problem there is that Valek knows we'll…""How about I write to Enoch?" said Lee, interrupting his friend."Oh good one, Valek won't be expecting that," conceded George."Also write one to Miro," added Fred quickly. "He's training to be an Auror right? Plus he knows us. He'll have to believe us.""Have to? I don't know about that but it'll be worth a try," said Fred, shrugging his shoulders."What'll I say?"A few hours later the three boys made their way down to the Owlery to send their letters away. For Enoch's letter they picked a particularly hefty looking owl for the undoubtedly long and arduous journey and sent it on its way. They just grabbed the closest owl for Miro's. As they watched the two owls leave over the horizon they were interrupted by a familiar face."Alright guys," said Oliver Wood entering through the main doorway of the Owlery. He was carrying a large letter and waved it in the air before waiting for an owl to volunteer its services."Alright Oliver, good Christmas?""It was okay I guess," said Oliver . A brown barn owl had flapped down onto a wooden perch next to the boy and waited patiently for him to affix the letter to his leg. "It's normally just my parents and me but this year we had all the relatives over and ended up playing a friendly game of Quidditch after lunch. And things got a bit… heated.""What did you do?" asked Fred, knowing that Oliver could sometimes become a little bit over the top when it came to his favourite game. And by 'sometimes' he meant 'always' and by 'little bit over the top' he meant 'more mental than a dwarf in a diamond mine who'd forgotten to bring his pickaxe'."I didn't do anything," said Oliver innocently, as he attached the letter to the owl's leg. "I just pointed out that maybe my great Aunt Bessie wasn't the best choice to play Seeker on our team.""And that's it?""Well, my mum and dad weren't doing very well as Beaters, and my cousins were next to useless as Chasers. I mean, I wasn't the best when I was four but I could at least throw a bit further than them, none of them followed my tactics either. It's like they weren't even trying to take it seriously. Why play it at all if you aren't even going to try to win?" said Wood, shaking his head. "None of them turned up for the early morning training for a follow up game the next day either.""How early?" asked Lee."Six.""Six? In the morning? On Boxing Day?" said Fred."Yeah, I know right?" said Oliver, disappointedly. He let the owl go and watched as it flew off on its errand. "I was going to wake them at five but I thought I'd be generous and give them a bit of a lie in.""A whole hour? Very generous," nodded George."Speaking of early morning practice," said Oliver, perking up, "I've got some good news.""You've decided against them?" asked Fred, sounding hopeful."No, why would I do that?" said Oliver in a confused tone. "Quite the opposite. I was able to book the pitch for early morning practices every day. Isn't that great?""How early?" said George, not really wanting to know the answer."Five. Every morning," beamed Oliver."Five? Every morning? Five? Five!""I know. I couldn't believe that none of the other teams had book those times, so I snapped them right up before they could." Oliver looked thoroughly delighted with himself. "I'm going to let the rest of the team know right now.""We'll come along," said George, nodding encouragement to his team captain."You will? Brilliant. That's what team spirit is all about.""We will?" said Fred turning to look at his brother."I want to see Angelina's face when Oliver tells her," admitted George."I want to see Oliver's face when Angelina clatters him one," added Fred.The news of the new training schedule was received as well as George had expected, and after a lot of shouting and complaining a compromise was reached. The team met every afternoon after class for a longer training session than normal and Oliver put any thoughts of five a.m. starts out of his mind while Angelina put any thoughts of hexing off Oliver's ears out of hers. Despite the compromise, Wood was still making them train harder than ever. Even though the snow had now been replaced by endless rain, he still expected the team to give their all during each and every practice. Although Fred and George thought that they could probably do with more rest and less work, Wood kept reassuring them it would be worth it in the end. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship and it was upon this goal which Wood had become fixated.It was during one particularly wet and muddy practice session that Oliver gave the team some of the worst news they could possibly hear. The twins were busy dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms, much to the enjoyment of the team. Well, most of the team."Will you stop messing around!" Oliver yelled, as he wave his hands towards the two boys. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"George really did fall off his broom at these words. He landed heavily in a large muddy puddle and sloshed about a bit before being able to regain his balance and stand."Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin."The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, although they all decided to avoid the puddle in which George was still standing."It's not my fault," said Oliver, appearing rather crestfallen. "We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.""He already has an excuse to pick on us, he's Head of Slytherin," said Alicia as the group grumbled in agreement. George had finally squelched his way out of the puddle and was doing his best to try and wring water out of his practice robes. "How's that fair? Is McGonagall going to referee Slytherin's next game?""No she's… actually that's not a bad suggestion," said Oliver, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "I wonder if she would go for it.""So are we done for the day then?" asked George, looking uncomfortable as he squirmed from side to side. "Because the water is seeping into my socks… oh wait… yep and underwear too.""Yeah I think we're done today," said Angelina, the rain had caused her hair to stick to her face."Unless you guys want to practice for a bit longer?" said Oliver, hopefully. The rest of the team didn't need to say anything they just collectively gave him a look. "Maybe not.""Is there any way we can ask for Madam Hooch to referee the match?" said Katie as the team collected up the equipment and made their way back towards the castle. "There's no way Snape will give us chance of winning.""Already tried," sighed Oliver, carrying one side of the box that contained all the Quidditch gear. "I doubt McGonagall's happy about it either but there's nothing she can do without basically calling Snape a cheat.""Which he is," muttered Fred. His broom was slung over one shoulder while he used his spare hand to hold the other side of the large box."It'll be fine," said Oliver certainly. "We have the best team, and we have the best Seeker. Don't we Harry? Harry?""He's already gone in," said Angelina, shaking her head. "He left as soon as practice finished. Didn't you notice?""See? I told you we had the best Seeker. So fast I didn't even see him go," said Oliver cheerfully."What's up with you?" asked Alicia, looking over at George who was now walking in a rather strange waddle motion."The soaked underpants situation has now been upgraded to 'total'. It is not pleasant I can tell you," said George, grimacing.The team slowly, and rather squelchy, made their way back to the Gryffindor Common Room. The girls and Oliver immediately made their way to their respective dormitories to shower and change into something far warmer and drier than their current attire. Fred and George stayed in the Common Room to talk to Lee who had waved them over immediately when they entered through the portal door."What's up?" said George."Did you hear back from Enoch already?" said Fred eagerly."No, not a word, but I was thinking about how we could beat this Valek guy if he ever show up again. So I went to the library and got this." Lee pointed to a large book one the table in front of him."We're going to hit him with it? I mean it's a pretty big book but I doubt it'll stop him," said Fred, prodding the tomb with his finger."I dunno, if we dropped it on him from Gryffindor Tower I'd say we'd do a fair amount of damage," conceded George."Yeah but we'll have to get him to stay in one place long enough for us to aim it. I doubt it'll work. Good try though Lee," said Fred, sympathetically."Read the name of the book," said Lee flatly."Exotic and Extinct Magical Creatures by Elba Wolfsburg. And that'll make it more accurate when we throw it will it?"Silently Lee leaned forward and flicked the book open to the contents page. His finger tapped on one particular chapter title."Kosa… oh, Valek's a Kosa. How handy is that? Maybe that'll tell us how to stop him," said George excitedly."Good idea George. We'll call Lee's book throwing idea Plan B.""No, that was never… you know what? Forget about it, we'll see what the book says," said Lee. Since knowing the twins he thought he could generally tell when they were deliberately trying to wind him up but every now and then even he wasn't completely sure."Haven't you read it yet?" asked George."Nah, only just managed to find it before Madam Pince shooed me out of the library. Only sat down about ten seconds before you two came in.""Right. Kosa. Kosa. Kosa," said Fred flicking through the book. "Ah, here we are. Blah blah blah, history history history, more blah. Even more blah. Oh here we go. 'Kosa were notoriously difficult to kill…'""Perfect," mumbled George."'They were naturally immune to most forms of direct magic,'" said Fred, continuing to read from the book."Found that out the hard way," commented George, only to be shushed by Lee."'They were however susceptible to indirect magic as well as physical attacks, however the latter was not be recommended given the Kosa's formidable accelerated healing abilities that allowed it to survive most attacks that would kill lesser creatures. One wound that a Kosa could not heal itself from was one administered by a unicorn's horn as they were deathly allergic to its touch.'""That's it," said Lee, excitedly jabbing his finger down on the passage in the book. "We just need to get a unicorn's horn.""Brilliant," nodded Fred. "Any ideas where we can get one?""Nope.""Didn't that first year kid get one for his birthday?" said George. "What's his name? Something Thomas?""Dean Thomas and he got an actual horn, which, unless we plan on trying to deafen Valek, is pretty much useless," said Fred. "Think, where would we get a unicorn horn from?""Anywhere in Hogsmeade sell stuff like that?" asked Lee."Could try Dogweed and Deathcap?" ventured George."Nah, they only sell Herbology stuff," said Fred, shaking his head. "Pippin's? I know they just do potions but they might sell one as an ingredient.""I think they only sell finished potions but it's worth a try, I suppose," said George."What about The Hog's Head?""Lee, that's a pub. We're not trying to take Valek out for a drink," said Fred."Yeah I know it's a pub, it's a really dodgy pub. You know? The kind of dodgy pub where dodgy people sell all kinds of dodgy things.""Has the word dodgy just lost all meaning to anyone else?" asked George."I meant we could probably find someone down there who could sell one to us.""Oh yeah, that makes more sense," agreed Fred."There's also another option," said Lee, reluctantly. "There's always Snape's supply cupboard. I bet he'd have a least one lying around.""No chance we're going anywhere near messing with Snape until after the Quidditch game," said George. "If we get caught he'll make sure we don't play in the game. And there is no way I'm listening to a lecture from Oliver about doing what's best for the team.""So, we have to sneak down to Hogsmeade, to a dodgy pub, to do some under the table deal with one of the weirdoes that goes there, to get a unicorn's horn, to kill a Kosa, a creature that shouldn't exist anymore," clarified Lee. "To anyone else that would just be the most insanely bizarre thing they have ever done.""To us, it's a Tuesday," said George, squirming slightly."You okay?""Wet underpants Lee," said George, slapping a hand down on his friend's shoulder. "I have uncomfortably wet underpants."





--------




For the next few weeks the twins put any thoughts of locating a unicorn's horn out of their minds. Oliver had carefully, but firmly, explained the need for the pair of them to keep out of trouble, especially around Snape as he suspected that the teacher would use any excuse to put a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in detention and force them to miss the next match. Normally Fred and George would have ignored this request but Oliver was so insistent that they were actually worried his head might explode if they had the misfortune to tell him they weren't able to play. Since the only way to get hold of a unicorn's horn was to either steal from Snape's private supply cupboard or sneak into Hogsmeade, the boys elected to wait until after the upcoming match to put their plans into action.Oliver's suspicions were somewhat confirmed when the twins realised that Filch seemed to be stalking them wherever they went in the hope of catching them in the act. In the end they spent much of their free time in Gryffindor Tower so as to limit the temptation to break school rules. Although in the run up to the match both boys noticed that they were presented with much more opportunities for rule breaking than normal."Look at it," said George, hypnotically gazing at an old vase. There was a large sign on the plinth which read 'Do Not Touch, Under Any Circumstances. Dangerous.' He slowly reached a hand forward."George, don't," said Fred, slapping his brother's hand away."But I need to know. Why can't we touch it? What'll it do?" George looked at the vase with narrow eyes. "I've got to know.""Shouldn't you guys be down at the pitch already? The match is starting soon," said Lee. He was carrying a large folder containing a number of loose parchments, each of which were filled with handwritten notes and facts on the two teams for him to read from during his commentating."Yeah, we were just on our way when we saw this," said Fred, nodding towards the vase. "I can't believe we've never noticed it before.""That's because it wasn't here before. I saw Filch putting it out the other day," said Lee. He looked at the sign then back at the twins. "You know it's a trap right?""What? What do you mean trap?" said George, frowning. "How do you know what it does?""It doesn't do anything," said Lee. "The sign says don't touch, so if either of you touch it Filch or Snape can stick you in detention.""How would they know if we touch it?" said George, who hadn't taken his eyes off of the vase."Because Mrs Norris is sat right over there," said Lee, pointing across the corridor with his folder. The twins looked over their shoulders and sure enough the caretaker's cat was sat watching them from between the legs of a suit of armour. "It's a trap and you nearly fell for it.""Why that sneaky little git?" muttered George, trying to shoo the cat away. Mrs Norris responded by hissing at him. "I knew it was a trap anyway, I would never have touched the vase.""Yeah right," laughed Lee. He shifted his folder slightly and spilled half the contents on the floor. "Damn.""Here," said Fred, as the three boys started picking up the parchments."What's this?" said George, reading from one of the pages. "'George Weasley, seventy-five percent accuracy with Bludgers.'""Oh, I've just made notes of all the players, it helps me with the commentary," explained Lee, trying to sort the pages back into some sort of order."Seventy-five percent? Not bad," said George, handing the paper back to his friend."'Fred Weasley, eighty percent accuracy.' Hah, take that," said Fred, reading from his own sheet."Do you have these on all the players? Even the other teams?" asked George."Pretty much," nodded Lee. "Why?""You should show them to Oliver, he'll probably be interested in reading them. Might save us a few extra practices if he's holed up in his room with all this.""Good idea, I'll talk to him after the match.""'Angelina Johnson, smells like coconut and lavender. New shampoo?' Not entirely sure what this one has to do with Quidditch," said Fred, reading from another page."That shouldn't… I'll just…" stammered Lee, grabbing the parchment from his friend's hand and stuffing it into his pocket. "Shouldn't you be going?""Oh yeah," said Fred, pushing the last few pages towards his friend. He grabbed his brother by the collar. "Come on George.""See you later," called George over his shoulder. Lee wasn't sure if he had been talking to him or the vase.Down in the changing rooms almost everyone else was already dressed into the team Quidditch uniforms, only Harry was still in the process of pulling on his robes. Oliver looked at the twins as they entered and tapped at an imaginary watch on his wrist."I know, I know," said George, as they started to get changed. "We made it didn't we?""Only just," muttered Angelina. She turned to look at Fred. "What are you doing? Did you just sniff me?""What? No. If you must know I have a slight cold," said Fred, frowning. He made his way over to his brother. "He was right; coconut and lavender.""Now that we're all here," said Oliver, looking pointedly at the twins, "I just wanted to say a few words. We know Hufflepuff aren't the strongest team but Snape is refereeing and with the chance to overtake Slytherin he'll use any excuse to give out penalties against us. Don't give him that excuse. Play a clean game and we'll be fine. Chasers," he looked at Angelina, Alicia and Katie, "you could beat their 'keeper with your eyes closed, but if you go up to catch the Quaffle alongside one of them watch out for your elbows. Lift your arm too high and Snape will say you fouled the other player with an elbow to the head. Fred, George," he pointed at the brothers."That's us," said Fred, adjusting his robes."Don't tell us," said George. "Just keep doing what we do. Bludger here, Bludger there. Protect the team.""Don't hit any Bludgers at Snape," said Oliver in a warning tone."What? Why would…" started Fred before his captain cut him off with a look. "Fair enough.""We're the best team. We deserve to win. Make sure that happens. Our House is counting on us," said Oliver, punching a fist into his palm. He took Harry aside to give him a few words of individual encouragement, as Fred poked his head out of the door to look at the pitch."The whole school's out there! Even… blimey… Dumbledore's come to watch!" said Fred excitedly.The team made their way out onto the pitch and got into positions. The Snitch was released, then the Bludgers and finally Snape threw the Quaffle high into the air and blew the whistle. Angelina grabbed it first and passed it back to Alicia who in turn passed it across to Katie. The three girls continue to pass it back and forth amongst themselves trying to stretch the Hufflepuff Chasers out of position. Fred and George had barely had to defend against the Bludgers before Harry had gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. He streaked towards the ground like a bullet. He pulled up sharply with his hand raised in triumph. Between his fingers he held the Snitch.The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly."What's going on?" shouted Fred to his brother. "It can't be over already.""Harry did it," George replied. "He got the Snitch."The boys, along with the rest of the team, landed next to Harry and lifted him up onto their shoulder's as the rest of Gryffindor House spilled onto the pitch and surrounded the team whilst chanting Harry's name. They carried him all the way back to the changing rooms."Unbelievable Harry," beamed Oliver, slapping a hand down on his shoulder. "I knew you were good, but that was just… unbelievable.""Good one Harry," said Katie, nodding towards him."Top of the table," said Angelina, shaking her head. "When you told me Snape was refereeing I didn't think we stood a chance. But… top of the table.""Just Ravenclaw to go," said Alicia, smiling."Don't be getting ahead of ourselves," said Oliver. "Ravenclaw are still a good team, well need to practice loads if we're going to beat them.""Merlin's Beard, Oliver. Can't you just be happy that we've won?" said George, shaking his head."You're right," said Oliver, holding his hands up. "We won, that's all that matters today. Three cheers for Harry."Once the team had changed out of their clothes and returned their brooms to the shed, most of them made their way back to the Gryffindor common room where they were greeted by a jubilant crowd of supporters. Fred and George volunteered to liberate some cakes and other supplies from the kitchens and events quickly turned into party."Alright Ron? What happened to you?" Fred asked his younger brother who was holding a cloth filled with ice up against his nose"Nosebleed. Malfoy gave it to me but I gave him a black eye, so I'm pretty sure that means I won," explained Ron. He looked around the room. "Where's Harry?""He stayed behind in the changing room," said Fred, shrugging his shoulders. "Probably still a bit amazed that he caught the Snitch so quickly.""Here Fred," said a fifth year boy with a mouth full of food. "I think we're running low on cake. Any chance you or George…""George already went for some more cake and biscuits," said Fred, nodding his head towards the door. "Should be back any minute.""I wouldn't count on it," said Lee. "Just saw Filch dragging him off for detention.""He got caught stealing from the kitchens? Doesn't sound like him," said George, shaking his head."Of course it sounds like him. He steals from the kitchen all the time. You both do," said Lee, waving a small blue fairy cake under his friend's nose."Oh the stealing part is him. I meant the getting caught part.""Filch didn't put him in detention for that. George was on his way to the kitchen when Filch nabbed him," explained Lee."Then why…ah… the vase?""Yep, pushed it right off the table and it smashed to pieces," nodded Lee."Well at least it was worth it."Now that the Hufflepuff match was out of the way, Oliver relaxed his constant reminders to the twins to stay out of trouble which was why during one third years' outing into Hogsmeade that Lee, Fred and George found themselves standing outside the Hog's Head Inn. It was a dingy looking place with filth encrusted bay windows which made it impossible to see through. Inside was no better, with one small very dirty room that smelled faintly of something similar to, but not quite like, wet dog. The room was filled with rough wooden tables which had the odd melted stub of a candle resting in the middle. There were a number of people inside, but most had hoods pulled up over their faces and didn't seem to pay the new arrivals much interest."Where do we start?" whispered Lee."I say bar-keep, three Butterbeers when you're ready, my good man," said George, planting himself on one of the old stools up at the bar. It creaked uncertainly for a few seconds but didn't break."You got money?" muttered the barman in a gruff voice. "I don't give out free drinks to kids you know?""Here you go," said George dropping some coins down onto the counter."Not enough," said the man. "Need two more sickles.""Six sickles? For three Butterbeers? It's only four down at the Three Broomsticks," complained George."You're paying extra for the ambiance," replied the man."Does ambiance mean 'smell'?" Fred whispered to Lee."Look, do you want them or not?" snapped the man."Yes, we'll take them," said George.The barman scooped up the coins in one hand, reached under the counter and pulled up three dusty looking bottles of Butterbeers. He popped open each one and left them in front of the boys. Lee almost asked for a glass but one glance towards the shelves behind the bar was enough to see that it probably would have been cleaner to just pour the drink on the floor and lap it up with his tongue."So now what?" whispered Lee as the three boys slowly sipped at their drinks."I don't know," admitted Fred. "Should we just go over and ask someone?""You can't just wander over to a stranger and say 'here, do you have any unicorn horn? Pure unicorn mind none of that rhino stuff,'" explained George."Well how else are we going to do it?" asked Fred, turning to look at his brother."Er… we didn't really think this one through did we?" said George."Makes a change I suppose," said Lee sarcastically."I've an idea," said Fred. He turned back around and nodded at the barman who was busy wiping a dirty looking glass with an even dirtier looking cloth. "Excuse me, but me and my friends…""Associates," muttered George."What?" said Fred."Associates. It sounds better.""What does it mean?""Friends.""So how is that better than just saying 'friends'?" asked Fred, completely ignoring the fact that the barman had managed to produce an even more surly expression than when the boys first entered the Inn."That's what you say when you're looking to do any shady deals. Associates. It's like a code word. Trust me," said George, nodding encouragement."Sorry. Me and my associates were wondering if you knew anyone in the general area that might be able to get…""Procure," interrupted George."Procure," said Fred, without missing a beat, "some hard to get… sorry procure… items.""I won't have anything illegal in my pub," stated the barman, a little bit louder than necessary, "of course I can't stop what I don't know about can I?""Oh it's not illegal," said Lee quickly. "Just difficult to get.""Procure," said Fred."Procure," repeated Lee."Hmm," grumbled the man, jerking his head towards the far side of the room."So is that a yes?" said Fred, hopefully."Him," said the man. Pointing a finger towards a large figure with his back to the group. "He's always getting his hands on things.""Brilliant. Thanks," said George.The three boys made their way over to the table. As he was still turned away from them they couldn't see the man's face but they could tell he was huge. He had a large pitcher of drink on the table and was drinking directly from it, and even then it still looked small in his hands."Ahem," coughed George, "excuse me, the barman said that you might be able to help us get hold of something.""Oh he did, did he?" said the man turning around. The minute he saw the boys his eyes opened wide. "Wha' the bleeding hell are yeh doing here?""Hagrid?" said the three in unison surprised to see him."O' course it's me? Who else is it going ter be?" said Hagrid. "Yeh three shouldn't be in here. It's not right.""Friends of yours Hagrid?" asked the barman who had now come around from behind the counter and was standing next to the boys."No Aberforth, just students from the school. Where they should be goin' back ter right now," said Hagrid firmly."We were just looking…" Fred started to speak."Yeh were jus lookin' fer trouble, that's wha'," said Hagrid. "Now be on yer way before you find any.""But," said George."You heard the man. Off you go," said Aberforth, ushering them towards the door."No it's just… hang on… stop pushing," complained the boys before they were unceremoniously pushed out into cold air. "Well that was just rude.""Well that's that then," said George."We could always comeback another day, you know when Hagrid isn't here," said Lee."The barman would probably kick us out again," muttered Fred."So now what?" asked Lee, rubbing his hands together as he blew warm air onto them."Only one thing for it," said George, shrugging."Steal from Snape?" asked Fred."Steal from Snape," confirmed George.

Despite the cold weather outside it was rather uncomfortably hot inside the Potion's classroom. This was due to the boiling bubbling cauldrons that each pair of students were currently working around. George had been paired with Lee as most teachers, Snape included, had long worked out that pairing George and Fred together was just asking for trouble. Instead, Fred had been paired with Angelina."Will you pay attention?" snapped Angelina, who had been busy counting out a number of ingredients before dropping them into the golden liquid contain in the cauldron. Fred was slowly stirring it with a large wooden spoon. "Not too fast. Remember, you're supposed to be making a circle every seven seconds.""I'm sure it won't make much of a difference," muttered Fred, who kept looking over at his brother and Lee."Five times. Five times, I've been paired with you or your brother during this year and do you know how many times something has exploded on me?""Once?" ventured Fred."Five times. So pay attention because there won't be a sixth. Not today," said Angelina, putting in the last of the ingredients. She turned to look back at the book. "Right, what's next?"George looked over at Snape who was busy examining one of the other group's work. Lee grabbed hold of the wooden spoon and started stirring his cauldron, he nodded at his friend who in turn nodded at his brother. Fred, making sure Angelina was too preoccupied measuring out the next ingredient, carefully took out a vial from his pocket and emptied half the contents into his mixture."And this should be it," said Angelina, dumping a jar of blue powder into the cauldron. "Careful, Fred. You're stirring too fast. I said, you're stirring too fast. Slow down. Fred! You're…"Angelina's next words went unheard as a loud cracking sound deafened everyone in the room, this was swiftly followed by a bright flash."Arghh!" everyone tried to cover their eyes."What was that?" someone shouted."Calm down this instant," bellowed Snape as he blinked to try and clear his vision.It took a few more minutes before order was restored to the classroom. Only Fred and Lee noticed George shuffling back into position behind his table."Did you get it?" whispered Lee."Couldn't find it," muttered George. "We need another distraction.""This is a very simple potion," said Snape, who had now descended on Fred and Angelina's table. "Even the most foolish imbecile should be able to get it right. You just have to follow the instructions.""We did. We followed the instructions," said Angelina, her face was covered in soot and her hair was smoking slightly."Obviously not," said Snape. "Two points from Gryffindor. Pour it out. Start again.""I told you, you were stirring it too fast," said Angelina as she and Fred carefully lifted the cauldron to the stone basin and poured out the contents that had now gone a rather sickly green and lumpy consistency."Maybe you got the measurements wrong," countered Fred. He looked over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows. George shook his head and twirled his fingers around each other.What? - Fred mouthed to his brother.Again, do it again, - replied George."This time I'll stir and you measure out all the ingredients," said Angelina."Fine," said Fred. He looked down at the table, then over at the book, then back at the girl. "Er…""See those?" said Angelina, pointing at some green roots. "Five of them, cut up long ways. Then two cups of that powder. And finally pierce one of those purple things and put everything in in that order.""That's it?""That's the first part. Weren't you even paying attention earlier?" said Angelina, frustrated."My job was stirring," complained Fred."And you weren't even doing that right.""Fine, here we go.""Wait, it's not even boiling yet. Do you want it to explode?""Well…""No, the answer is no. Do you want it to explode? No, I don't want it to explode. Because wanting it to explode would be mental. I'm not mental and you're not mental, so we don't want it to explode." Angelina wiped her hand across her forehead and looked around the room. Everyone had stopped working and was staring at her. She waved a hand at Fred. "Just get on with it will you?""Yes, boss," said Fred, giving her a salute before starting to cut up the roots.Once the water was boiling Fred, under close supervision from Angelina, began dropping the ingredients into the cauldron in the correct order."One, two, three, four, five, six, seven," muttered Angelina under her breath as she slowly stirred the contents.Eventually they reached a point where the liquid turned the required gold colour and was ready for the next stage. Fred looked over at his brother who nodded encouragement."Right, measure out seven ounces of Berbowa extract," ordered Angelina."Er…""The blue stuff there," said Angelina, pointing."Oh right," said Fred picking it up. He carefully poured out the correct amount and turned back to his cauldron. He pointed to two students behind Angelina. "Is it going to turn that colour?"As Angelina turned to look at the other table, Fred poured the Berbowa extract, along with the rest of the vial from his pocket, into the cauldron."Hopefully. If we've done everything right," said Angelina, turning back and continuing to stir. Fred closed his eyes.CRACK!"Not again," shouted a voice."My foot, someone trod on my foot," shouted another.Once again there were a few minutes of disruption as people's vision and hearing gradually returned. By the time Angelina was able to see again Snape was already standing next to her."I don't know why it isn't working. I'm following everything we're supposed to," moaned Angelina in a defeated tone."Maybe Mr Weasley has an explanation," said Snape, turning to look at the boy."Haven't a clue sir. Maybe the book is wrong?" he tried."The book?" said Snape, raising an eyebrow. "The Potion's book? The Potion's book that has been assigned to third year classes for the last seventy years… is wrong?""It's possible," said Fred."Or maybe it could be because you decided to add an extra ingredient into the mixture. Turn out your pockets Mr Weasley," said Snape, staring at the boy with unblinking eyes."My pockets?" said Fred, trying to sound innocent. "No problem."He pulled each of his trouser pockets so that the insides hung out, before doing the same with the side pockets on his robes. As he had reached into the pocket that contained the vial he carefully adjusted his hand and palmed the bottle before pushing it up his shirt sleeve as quickly as he dared. It was a useful skill that he and his brother had developed out of necessity over the years."It appears I may have been mistake," said Snape coolly. He held out a hand. "Please accept my apologies.""Oh… er… of course," said Fred, momentarily taken aback, as was pretty much the whole class. He reach out his hand and shook Snape's. As they were shaking hands, Snape gripped firmly and pulled the boy closer, he then used his spare hand to push Fred's robe and shirt sleeve back. The vial dropped out and bounced off his shoe before rolling noisily across the floor. Snape stopped its journey with his foot."A Thunder and Lightning Potion if I'm not mistaken. A simple but relatively pointless solution," said Snape, smelling from the vial. He looked at Fred. "Any thoughts as to how this found its way up your sleeve?""Er… magic?" tried Fred."Is that the best you can come up with?""At the moment. I could come up with something better if you gave me some time.""How much time?""Four or five years might do it.""Very amusing," said Snape with a tight-lipped expressionless face. "Now we have the 'how', we have the 'who', all that remains is the 'why'? Care to venture any thoughts Mr Weasley?""Not really," said Fred, shaking his head."Actually I was asking the other Mr Weasley?" said Snape, looking up at George. All eyes were now turned to the other twin."Me sir?""Did you find what you needed in my private stores? It must have been very important to require two trips.""Ah… well…" Before he could answer the school bell signalled the end of class."You two will stay behind and clean out everyone's cauldron while I check the contents of my supply room," said Snape, pointing at Fred and George in turn. "Everyone else dismissed.""I am never being your partner again," whispered Angelina as she grabbed her bag. "Seven times now. Seven!""Bad luck guys," said Lee compassionately."Don't worry about it," said Fred, slapping him on the shoulder.As the rest of the class filtered out, Fred and George removed their robes and pulled up their sleeves of their shirts and began taking each cauldron to the basin to empty. Most of them were okay to clean but the odd few, most notably belonging to those students who generally received poor Potion's marks, smelled so badly that the boys pulled their shirts up over their noses to try and block some of the stink from invading their nostrils. It was not very effective."Sir?" said Fred, once they had cleaned out all of the potions. "We've finished.""Then wait until I have finished checking my supplies," said Snape's voice from the next room."Did you get it?" whispered Fred."Couldn't find any?" answered George."I said 'wait' not 'talk'," said Snape.They patiently waited as the minutes ticked passed. One minute. Five. Ten. Twenty. In the end it was nearly a full hour before Snape returned to the classroom."It appears there is nothing missing," said Snape slowly. "What exactly were you looking for?""Lapburg Root," said George quickly."Lapburg Root is on the second shelf on the left and is marked very clearly," said Snape. "Try again.""We were looking for a unicorn horn," said George, reluctantly."Why?""We were trying out some potions for ourselves," said Fred."Yeah, because we really love the subject," said George, trying to appear earnest."Very well. Detention for both of you, and five points from Gryffindor for disrupting my class, and a further five points for continuing to lie.""But we're not lying.""Forgive me if I am not convinced. If any further ingredients go missing you two will be the first to be interrogated. And rest assured the experience will not be pleasant. Now leave.""Well that was close," said Fred, once they were on the other side of the door."What do you mean 'close'? He caught us, you can't get much closer than that.""You really didn't find any?""Nah, the drawer was empty. Probably all been used up over the year. I wonder if he's getting any more in," said George."You want to go back and ask him?""Maybe not," conceded George.The two boys made their way up from the dungeons where the Potion's classroom was located to the main hall. They were just about to start climbing the staircases towards Gryffindor Tower when a rather worried looking Lee met them coming down the other way."Alright Lee?" asked Fred."No," said Lee, shaking his head. "I got a message that McGonagall wants to see us in her office.""Us? All three of us?" said George."Yep.""That can't be good," said Fred. The three boys made their way up to the first floor of the tower where McGonagall's office was located. Along the way they tried to work out what she could possibly want with all three of them, they kept coming back to the most obvious answer."We might not be in trouble," said Lee, hopefully."True, but let's face it, we're in trouble. The only thing is I have absolutely no idea what we've done," said George."You do remember our Potion's class that we just had?" said Lee."Yes, but only Fred and I got in trouble for that. Individually we've done things that would get us into trouble. But not all three of us," explained George."Yeah, you're like our safety net, if you're in trouble as well it narrows down the list of what we could have done," said Fred, patting Lee on the shoulder. They had reached the door to McGonagall's office. No one moved. "Should we knock?""Probably," admitted Lee."Well go on then," said Fred, nodding encouragement."Why do I have to knock? You knock.""I don't want to knock. George, you do it.""I'm not doing it.""How about we all do it at the same time?" said Lee."Seems fair. On three?" said George, looking at the other two for confirmation. "Okay. One, two, three."No one moved."You didn't knock," complained George."You didn't either.""Well I wouldn't have to if one of you had done it.""If you've quite finished with your dilly-dallying, you can come in," called McGonagall's voice from inside the room."Is she talking to us?" whispered Fred."For goodness sake," said Lee, shaking his head. He pushed open the door and made his way inside.McGonagall's office was a large room decorated with a number of tartan plaid wall hangings. A roaring fire blasted heat into the room while on the mantelpiece there were several black and white photos of various wizards and witches.. McGonagall was sat behind her desk looking rather stern while in front of her were two seats which were currently occupied, however the figures had their back's to the door."You wanted to see us?" said Fred. At the sound of his voice the two people in the chairs turned around. One was immediately recognisable. "Alright Miro, what are you doing here?""Er… well," said Miro, looking a bit embarrassed. He looked over to his companion who seemed familiar to the twins."Did you three send Mr Franca here a letter?" asked McGonagall, her lips in a tight thin line."A letter?" said George, pretending to frown."Yes, a letter. In which you say, and I quote 'there's a Kosa in the Dark Forest that tried to kill us, any chance of some help?'," said McGonagall, reading from the letter in question. "Upon receiving this letter, Mr Franca showed it to his trainer Mr Lexington…""That's where I know you from," said George, who had spent the last couple of minutes trying to guess the identity of the man. "You attacked us in Diagon Alley, well not us, Miro, but it's still the same thing.""And that's why I'm here," said Mr Lexington. "A Kosa is serious business.""We don't even know if there is one," said McGonagall sternly."But these boys saw one," said Mr Lexington, he jabbed a finger down on the letter. "It says so right here.""Yes, but these particular boys…" McGonagall tried to think of a diplomatic way of voicing her thoughts, "well let's just say there's a credibility factor that has to be taken into account.""What does that mean?" said Fred."She's calling you liars boy," said Mr Lexington."I wouldn't have put it quite like that," said McGonagall, quickly. She leaned forward in her chair. "Now, think about this carefully. Are you absolutely sure that you are telling the truth? That you went into the Dark Forest, unaccompanied, at night, despite it being expressly forbidden and that you encountered a magical creature that the Ministry of Magic itself has classified as extinct? Is that what you are saying?""Actually, no. We definitely weren't out of Gryffindor House after hours and we certainly would never even dream of going into the Dark Forest. Would we Fred?" said George"Of course not George. Wouldn't dream of it. I've never once been in that forest and I don't have any plans to either," added Fred. "Right Lee?""Er… right," said Lee, a little bit confused."Then why did you write this letter?" asked McGonagall."The letter? Right, well the reason I wrote that…" said Lee, trying to think of an answer."It's obvious isn't it?" said George, shaking his head."It is?" said McGonagall."Yep," nodded George."And are you going to furnish us with this obvious explanation or are we to guess?" said McGonagall, leaning back on her chair."Oh right. It's for… erm…""It's for school," said Fred quickly, once it became his brother was struggling for an answer."For school?" said McGonagall sceptically."Defence Against the Dark Arts," said Lee."Yes," said Fred, pointing at his friend. "See, Professor Quirrell set us an essay about dangerous creatures.""And it could be about anything so Lee wanted to write about the Kosa," said George."I picked Werewolves, I've always been a dog person," said Fred. "Well they're wolves but they're like cousins to dogs aren't they?""What has all this got to do with writing to Mr Franca?" said McGonagall tersely."Ah… well…" said Lee, he looked over at his friends for some help."It's because he was cheating," said Fred."No, I'm sure it wasn't that," said Lee, shaking his head slightly."Yeah, there aren't many good books in the library on the Kosa," said George, picking up the lie and running with it, "so he figured if he wrote to Miro, then he might know a bit about them. What with being an Auror and everything.""See?" said McGonagall, turning to look at Mr Lexington. "Nothing but fanciful thoughts from an over-imaginative child. I am sorry you wasted a trip up here.""A trip back to Hogwarts is never wasted Professor McGonagall," said Mr Lexington, smiling kindly. "Since I am up here I don't suppose I could get a tour of the castle. It's been years since I was back and I'd like to see the old place again, if you don't mind.""Of course not," said McGonagall, rising from her chair."Miro, why don't you catch up with your old chums?" said Mr Lexington. "I'll meet you in the main hall in an hour. Off you go.""Oh, yes Mr Lexington," said Miro, nodding to the man. He stood up and motioned to the three boys to leave the room with him."Mr Jordan, I shall talk to you later regarding how each student must do their own homework," said McGonagall as the boys were leaving."Yes Professor," said Lee. Outside he turned to the twins. "Thanks for that. I'll probably be put in detention now.""That's better than being punished for being out of Gryffindor House late at night and for entering the Forbidden Forest. Probably get expelled for that," said George."I didn't do either of those things," complained Lee."So what actually happen?" asked Miro."Wait. You believe us?" said Fred."Let's move away from here," said Miro, waving them down the corridor. After a few steps he continued talking, "to be honest when I first got the letter I thought you were just trying to wind me up, but then Mr Lexington saw it and all hell broke loose. He petitioned to have a whole squad of Aurors come up to the school and comb through the forest.""Well, why didn't they?" asked Lee."Because the Ministry didn't believe him. There's a reason there aren't many old Aurors," explained Miro as the three boys walked. "It's a dangerous job, most are killed while on duty, those that don't start getting a bit paranoid. They start seeing danger when there isn't any.""So you're saying he's two wings short of a Pegasus?" said Fred."Two barn owls short of a post office?" added George."Two… er… carrots short of a… casserole?" said Lee, looking at his friends uncertainly."That works," nodded George."What?" asked Miro frowning."He's nuttier than… erm… something that contains a large amount of nuts," said Fred."A squirrel's pantry?" said George."Yes, that would be it," said Fred, pointing at his brother. "Nuttier than a squirrel's pantry.""He's not crazy, just… eccentric," said Miro, finally settling on a suitable word."Yeah, eccentric like a cuckoo," said George, twirling his finger in a circle around his ear."Look. Do you know who killed the last Kosa?" asked Miro. The three boys just shrugged. "Mr Lexington did. It was years ago and the Ministry gave him this medal and had a big ceremony and everything. They declared that the Kosa were extinct, but Mr Lexington never believed it. He always thought there were more of them. He has a whole file on weird unexplained disappearances or murders that he thinks are down to one or more of them. So when he saw my letter, that was all the encouragement he needed.""So it's just you two then?" said Fred."Yeah, the Ministry won't help," said Miro. "In fact if they realised that's why we're up here Mr Lexington would be demoted or fired from the Aurors.""What about you?" asked Lee."Our cover is that I'm being brought up here for training. The Dark Forest has a whole bunch of dangerous creatures so it's pretty believable. Mr Lexington said if anyone found out what we were really doing up here then he'll just say he didn't tell me anything and that I thought it was really just training. Although let's face it fighting a Kosa would be a pretty intensive bit of training.""Great," said George, "so what can we do to help?""You can stay out of the way for a start," said Miro. He held his hand up before anyone could complain. "Look, you aren't trained, you don't know nearly enough spells and you'll only get in the way. Even I shouldn't be up here, this is a job for actual Aurors but Mr Lexington needed back-up and there wasn't anyone else.""So you just expect us to hide in the castle?" scoffed Fred."That's exactly what we expect," said Miro. "The Dark Forest is dangerous enough in the first place.""What if he comes to the castle? What then?" asked George."That's easy," said Fred. "We go hide in the Forest.""He won't come into the castle, it's too dangerous for him," said Miro, shaking his head. He reached into his pocket. "But if he does, and that's a big if, you should have these on you.""Nice one," said Fred, taking one of the two unicorn horns that the trainee-Auror was holding."We've been trying everywhere to get one of these," said George, taking the other horn."Hey, what about me?" complained Lee."He's not after you," explained Miro. "Besides these were expensive so we could only requisition four without raising suspicion, and we need the other two. I'll expect them back.""So what's the plan?" said Fred, swishing the horn around like a wand."We've booked a couple of rooms at the Three Broomsticks. We'll stay there at night and hunt the woods during the day. Hopefully we'll find him in the next week or so. That's the longest we can stay away without questions being asked.""What if you don't find him in that time?""I don't know," said Miro. "But it won't be good. We'll meet up with Mr Lexington later. He'll want to hear everything about your encounter with the Kosa."





--------




The three boys spent the next week on tenterhooks waiting for news to come from Miro and Mr Lexington. Finally, when they had some free time, they used one of the secret passages to get from the school to Hogsmeade to find out more. When they arrived at the Three Broomsticks they found the two men downstairs with their bags already packed. Unfortunately they didn't have any good news."Nothing?" said Fred, as the three boys sat down next to their old school friend and his teacher."Nothing, no signs, nothing," said Mr Lexington, disappointedly. He waved a hand across to the barmaid and ordered the new arrivals some Butterbeers."But there has to be something," said George."The Forest is a dangerous place, this Valek guy might not have wanted to stay around. Kosa are especially tough but they can still be killed by some of the creatures in there," explained Miro."We checked out a few of the most likely places," said Mr Lexington, pulling out a roughly drawn map from his pocket. There were numerous red marks and notes scribbled across the parchment. "Caves, a few clearings, and so on, but we found nothing. He could still be there and covering his tracks, or more likely once you two got away he did the smart thing and left as well.""What about secret tunnels or hideouts? We found Fenter Prevend's hidden catacombs two years ago, there might be more like that?" said Fred."I thought the caretaker found that," said Mr Lexington, rubbing his chin. "Fletch, or Finch, or something.""Filch," corrected George. "We found it but he took the credit. It's not a smart thing to let people know you go wandering around the Dark Forest.""It's not a smart thing to go wandering around the Dark Forest in the first place," said Miro."So what happens now?" said Lee. He mumbled his 'thanks' to Rosemerta as she delivered the boys' drinks."We go home," said Mr Lexington, shrugging. "Look, I know you're disappointed but there isn't much we can do without actual proof he is still in the area. If we stay any longer then people in my office will start asking questions.""What'll we do if he comes back?" said Lee."We'll give him the old unicorn horn," said Fred, making a pretend stabbing motion with his hand."I doubt he'll come back," said Mr Lexington, shaking his head. "They prefer to have the element of surprise. Now that he's revealed himself he's lost that. I'd be more worried about your uncle. You said he was the main target right? Did you ever hear back after you wrote to him?""No," said George. "We don't even know if the owl found him.""It probably did," said Mr Lexington. "He's a smart man, is your uncle, he'll probably wouldn't risk sending you back a letter until he had dug himself in somewhere safe.""You know Enoch?" asked George, taking a long drink from his Butterbeer. He wiped the back of his hand across his lips where a frothy moustache had formed."Oh yes, he trained as an Auror at the same time as me," nodded Mr Lexington."Enoch's an Auror?" said Fred, looking surprised. "He kept that quiet.""Well he trained as an Auror," said Mr Lexington, smiling as he leaned back on the wooden bench. "It was for about two weeks, before he was kicked out for not exactly following the rules.""Why? What did he do?" said Lee, draining the last of his drink in one go."A whole bunch of little things. Just wouldn't follow the rules," sighed Mr Lexington. "You boys ever dealt with a Boggart?""Not in person, but we covered them in class," said Fred. "They're supposed to take the shape of the thing you fear most right?""Exactly. Well part of an Auror's training early on is to face a Boggart. This way the trainers get to see what their student's biggest fear is. Now, the Boggart-Banishing-Charm turns the Boggart into something humorous and it's the laughter that this causes that finishes off the creature.""Riddikulus," said Lee, recalling the incantation they had learnt for one of their Defence Against the Dark Arts' homework."Well done. Now that's what you're supposed to do," said Mr Lexington. "That's not what your uncle did. He steps into the room, faces the Boggart and it turned into this horrible looking swamp monster thing, and instead of using the Charm do you know what your uncle did?""What?" said Fred and George in unison."He walked straight up to it and punched it square in the face. Knocked it right onto its backside," said Mr Lexington laughing. "I can still picture our trainer's face. He didn't know what to do. Your uncle is the only person I've ever known who has beaten up a Boggart.""That sounds about right," said George, nodding his head."Look," said Mr Lexington, letting out a long sigh, "you three are probably fine. This Kosa will have gone back to hiding under whatever rock he crawled out of. I doubt he'll be back, not to Hogwarts at least. This one hasn't survived long without being smart and to try and attack anyone while Dumbledore is here would be very stupid indeed. However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful. Don't go wandering off school grounds on your own. Make sure at least one other person knows where you are at all times and always carry those unicorn horns with you, I'll let you hang on to those for the time being. I'll get Miro here to keep you up-to-date with anything we find.""Any other tips in case we do end up coming face to face with Valek again?" asked Fred."Yes," nodded Mr Lexington, "make sure you are wearing good running shoes."Over the next few weeks the boys took heed of Mr Lexington's warning to stay inside the castle, although this was more to do with the inclement weather than any actual desire on their part. The Quidditch team's last match of the year wasn't due to take place until after the exams had finished so Fred and George, and the rest of the team, were enjoying an extended break from practices as Oliver spent more time revising for his Ordinary Wizard Level exams. This had left Fred and George with plenty of free time, which they spent trying out spells that they thought might give them an advantage during a fight with Valek."What's wrong with Immobulus?" asked Fred, as he and George circled each other wands raised. They had been practice duelling for the last hour or so in their dormitory while Lee sat on the bed examining the Marauder's Map. "It's a Freezing Charm. I think Valek might find it a bit difficult to chase us if he's frozen. Plus once he's frozen we can go over and stab him with the horn.""It's a direct spell," said George. "They don't work on him remember.""Okay how about this one?" said Fred. He flicked his wand towards his brother, "Pertificus Totalus.""You little bugge…" George's sentence was cut short as his entire body turned rigid. He fell backwards like a plank and smacked his back on his bed before spinning over onto the floor and landing on his face."Ouch, sorry George," said Fred, quickly performing the counter-curse that allowed his brother to start moving again. "Still, you've got to admit it's pretty good.""That's not quite the four letter word I'd use right about now," said George, rubbing his nose. "And again, direct spell, so useless on a Kosa.""This is trickier than I thought," said Fred, tapping his chin with his wand. "Hang on what about… no, that's a direct spell. Oh what about… no, that's the same. Ah how about… no, no, that's one I made up in a dream. Unless there is a spell that makes monkey's fly out of someone's backside?""No, I'm pretty sure there isn't a spell like that," said Lee without looking up"Plus, even if there was it's still a direct spell so wouldn't have any effect on Valek," said George."Did I say I was going to use it on Valek?" countered Fred. "Maybe I was going to use it on you and then command the monkeys that came out to attack Valek. Did you think of that?""No, no one would ever think of that," said George. He looked over at Lee. "I meant to ask, what are you doing with that any way?""I was seeing if Valek would turn up on it," said Lee. "No luck though.""Would he even show up on that?" asked George."That's what I'm starting to think," said Lee, he took out his wand and wiped the map with the incantation. "Maybe Mr Lexington was right. Maybe Valek has left.""Probably," nodded George, "I was talking to Hagrid about all the things there are in the Forest, other than the ones we've already met, and I'm starting to think that the last place anyone would want to hide. You be afraid you'd wake up half way down something's throat.""Speaking of things half way down throats," said Lee, nodding at the clock on the wall above the doorway. "Time for dinner.""Already?" said George. His stomach suddenly rumbled loud enough for the others to hear. He patted it with his hand. "See? That clock is at least a minute early.""Right, I'll catch you up," said Fred."We can wait if you want," said George."Oh no need. It's fine," said Fred, waving the other two out of the room."What was that all about?" said Lee, as he and George made their way down the stairs. The rest of the House were similarly making their way down to the Great Hall, and the two boys filtered into the queue slowly exiting through the portal into the corridor."You remember what next week is don't you?""Yeah," said Lee, "Easter holiday. It can't come quick enough.""I thought you were staying here for the holidays?""I am," said Lee, saying a quick 'hello' to the Fat Lady as they passed by her portrait, "I just meant that it gives us two weeks without any getting any more homework. I swear they are deliberately doing it so we have less free time.""That's okay, you can copy off me if you want," said George."If I'm copying off you , who are you copying off?""Easy, Fred of course.""And who is he copying off?""Have no idea, but hopefully it'll be off someone good. I nearly failed my last History of Magic," said George."Didn't you copy that one off me?" said Lee, indignantly."Yes, and you should put a bit more effort in next time. My grades are counting on you," scolded George. "Anyway that's not what I meant about next week.""Oh really? Why? What's happening… oh no. No, no, no," said Lee, stopping in his tracks so suddenly a second year boy bumped into him."Oh yes," said George, smiling as he nodded. "It's Fred and my birthday, which means…""A day of horror and dread?""Close. April Fool's day, a glorious day of pranking my brother into submission.""So basically the same thing then? I wonder if it's too late to ask my parents if I can go home for the holidays?" said Lee, thoughtfully. "So what's that got to do with Fred staying behind?""Obviously he's checking on his pranking supplies," said George, tapping his nose with his finger. "There's a loose floorboard next to his bed, I think he's been hiding his stuff there. I'm planning on stealing them the night before and maybe sticking an exploding custard pie in their place. It's a cheap shot but sometimes those are the funniest.""Right, I just want you to know, I am not getting involved in this in any way," said Lee."Oh? So you're taking his side then are you?" said George, casting a suspicious sidelong look at his friend."What? No," said Lee, quickly. "I'm not taking anyone's side.""Ah, so you're planning something on your own are you?""No. I'm not taking sides, I'm not planning anything, I just want to survive the day," said Lee."Okay, I read you. I fully understand," said George, giving his friend a knowing wink."No, seriously," said Lee, stopping in his tracks. "I need you to understand, I am not getting involved in this.""Sure thing," said George, nodding slightly whilst winking again."No, seriously… wait."Lee continued to try to convince George that he wanted no part in the upcoming April Fool's day pranks between the two twins, and was still trying by the time Fred had joined them at the table in the Great Hall. The food was hot and plentiful, and pleasant smells filled the entire room.Halfway through dessert Fred looked up and saw a handful of owls had flown into the Hall."Evening post is here," said Fred, taking a large spoon of custard and dumping it into his bowl."That's like your third helping of that ," said Lee."Don't worry, there's plenty of room left for fourths," said Fred, patting his stomach."Don't get him started on custard," warned George. "If he could live on the stuff…ouch. Hey!"George had been interrupted by a owl dropping a letter onto his head. He picked up the envelope, shooed the bird away, and read the writing on the front."It's from Enoch," said George, opening the letter and reading it for a few moments. He frowned. "This doesn't make any sense.""Why? What does it say?" asked Lee."It's all over the place. He's talking about Aunt Taffeta in one sentence and then he's on about our mum and dad in the next. He doesn't mention anything about Valek. You don't think he's finally cracked, do you?" asked George."Give us a look," said Fred. He took the letter. "Something's got to be up. This is just rambling. What do you think, Lee?""Why does he keep putting capital letters in when he doesn't need to and missing some out when he does?" said Lee, taking the parchment from his friend. "Hang on a minute. Has either of you got a quill?""No, but I've got the next best thing," said Fred, excitedly, "I got it off one of the Muggleborn kids. Check it out.""What is it?" said Lee, examining the long thin object in his brother's hand."It's called… a biro," said Fred, he clicked his thumb on end. "You write with it. I was going to send it to dad, he collects them.""Okay," said Lee, taking the pen from his friend. "Just need some ink now.""No, need," said Fred, smugly. "Just write with it, the ink is already inside.""How?" asked Lee, looking at the end of the pen."No idea, probably tiny imps or something," said Fred. "I had two but I tried opening the other one and I just broke it and got ink everywhere.""Okay, where was I? Oh yes, the letter," said Lee, turning back to looking at the page. "Right 'M', 'E'… Merlin's Beard, it writes so smoothly.""I know, right? I'm thinking of getting one for class, much easier than the quill and ink," said Fred. "What's with 'M' and 'E'?""Oh, they're the capital letters," said Lee, pointing at the parchment. "I'm thinking they might be a secret message.""'M' and 'E'? Me?" said George."'E', 'T'," said Lee, continuing marking the letters down."Me et? Hmmm, so he ate something did he?" said Fred, rubbing his chin."'M', 'E', 'A', 'T'.""Me et meat," said Fred, triumphantly. He frowned. "That's hardly news is it? I saw him once each a whole chicken by himself.""Why don't you wait until I've finished?" said Lee, still scratching down letters."Just thought I was helping," said Fred sulkily before turning back to his bowl of custard."There," said Lee, eventually."Let's see what we've got," said Fred, peering over his friend's shoulder. "Right, 'me et meat mdn ght br thdy fire plc comrm.' Okay, I've got it: Enoch's gone crazy.""No," said Lee, shaking his head and concentrating. "I think the first word isn't 'me', it's 'meet'.""Right so, 'meet meat'… meet meat?""Or it's 'meet me at'," said George, pointing to each individual word."Nice one George," said Fred. "Although the rest is still gibberish. The only word I can make out is 'fire'.""What about 'fireplace'?" said Lee."There's no 'a' or 'e'," scoffed Fred. "And I thought my spelling was bad.""Maybe he shortened it. 'Comrm', could be… got it. Short for 'common room'," said Lee, looking pleased. "Fireplace common room.""Okay so he wants us to meet him at the fireplace in the common room at 'Mdnghtbrthdy'," said Fred, slurping on his spoon. "Mdnght, mdnght, mudding hot? Mad nag hit? Medan ghoat?""Now you're just making up works," said George."I don't hear you coming up with suggestions," complained Fred."That's because I'm trying to think, but I can't because you're just gabbling on.""I'm not gabbling on, I'm thinking out loud.""Can you try doing it a bit quieter?""How can you think out loud quietly? The word 'loud' is right there. Otherwise it would be called thinking out quiet. Think about it," said Fred, tapping the side of his head with his spoon. He had to wipe a bit of custard out of his hair with the back of his hand."Just be quiet will…""Midnight," said Lee, suddenly. "It's midnight, and birthday. 'Meet me at midnight birthday fireplace common room.'""Brilliant. Lee, you're a genius, " said Fred, slapping his friend on the back. "Now, when's Enoch's birthday?""It's in the summer I think," said George."Lee, you're an idiot, it's not his birthday for ages. The message doesn't make any sense," said Fred."It's your birthday next week," pointed out Lee."Aw, you remembered. Oh wait, maybe Enoch meant our birthday. Lee, you're a genius again," said Fred, slapping him on the back once more."Midnight on our birthday," nodded George. "I think we can do that.""Wait, is that midnight going into your birthday or midnight when you birthday finishes?" said Lee, quickly. He looked at the twins who seemed confused. "It could be either at the start of your birthday or the end. Which do you think he meant?""Start, obviously," said George."End, obviously," said Fred at the same time. They looked at each other."Start.""End.""Start!""End.""Bet?""Eyebrows?""Deal.""Idiots," muttered Lee.

"Is it midnight yet?" mumbled Lee as he lay across the armchair. His head perched on one armrest while his feet dangled over the other one."Another couple of minutes," said George, looking up at the clock over the fireplace.The three boys were the only occupants of the Common Room. It was dark, the only light in the room was coming from the fire as it cast flickering shadows on the wall. George was sat normally in one of the other chairs, and Fred was sat upside down, with his head leaning off the edge while his feet drooped over the back."Yep and then it's snip, snip," said Fred, mimicking shaving his eyebrows."Wouldn't it be 'shave, shave'?" asked George."Well you should know, it's going to be you doing it.""You're going to let me shave your eyebrows? I'd be honoured," said George, taking a peanut from a bowl on the table, cracking it open, and flicking the nut inside up into the air which he caught in his mouth first time."No, see, because you'll be doing…" said Fred before his brother cut him off mid-sentence."I'll be doing the best I can to be careful. Although it's not like I can mess it up really. I'm shaving them all off anyway," said George. "It's nice that you can admit you were wrong.""I didn't admit…" said Fred, quickly swinging his legs around so that he was now sat properly."Shh," said Lee, waving his hand at the two boys, and pointing up at the clock. "It's time."The second hand clicked passed the number twelve and the three boys' eyes moved from the clock down to the fireplace. They waited. And waited. The only sounds were from the ticking of the clock and the crackling of the fire."Well…" said Fred, looking thoroughly smug."Give it a minute will you," said George, flapping a hand towards his brother. "Enoch was always a bit late.""I'm just saying, you said it was this midnight. It's midnight and he's not here. I'm not sure but I think that means I win," said Fred, he glanced at his brother. "Does it mean I win? I think I win.""Just wait a moment will you," ordered George, appearing a bit unsure for the first time. "He'll appear okay?""Oh yes, " nodded Fred. "He'll appear all right. At midnight at the end of the day. Just like I said he would.""Did you see that? Just then?" said George, pointing at the fire excitedly. "Right there. It was a face. Definitely a face.""I didn't see anything," said Lee, he looked over at Fred who shook his head."Give it a minute, it'll be back," said George, staring at the same spot he had pointed towards."Sure it will," said Fred, sarcastically. "So are we borrowing someone's razor this time or shall I just try and curse your eyebrows off?""Whatever you prefer because it's you who'll be losing your eyebrows not me," countered George."Yeah, yeah, whatever you say," said Fred, smiling. "But we're only going to give you a couple more minutes and then you'll have to admit you were wrong.""Hey, even if Enoch doesn't appear now…""Aha! So you admit it?""I admit nothing, but what I'm saying is if I'm wrong it doesn't make you right.""Of course it does. Either he appears now or at the end of our birthday. He's didn't appear now, so he'll appear later.""Yes but if he doesn't appear later? There is still that possibility isn't there?" said George, reaching down behind his armchair and pulling out a bottle of Butterbeer he had brought down with him."Oh, yeah, I suppose. That's easy, if he doesn't appear now or later today then it's a draw," said Fred. "That means we both win.""Or both lose," said Lee."I prefer my way of thinking," said Fred. He nodded at his brother who had just popped the cap off of his drink. "Did you bring us any?""This? Oh no, I only had one left," said George, lifting the drink to his lips. Before he took a drink he looked across at his brother. He held the bottle out to him. "Fine. You look like Percy when we hide his homework. Here, we'll share, have a sip.""Nice one bro," said Fred, taking the drink and taking a large swig from the bottle."Well I think it's safe to say that Enoch isn't coming tonight," said George, standing up. "I guess I was wrong.""Ha," said Fred, trying to gloat. However, instead of a smug comment leaving his mouth he found a long trail of orange and green bubbles burst forth instead. "What? Blurgh," complained Fred as the froth continued to waterfall out of the boy's lips."Happy birthday Fred," said George, over the back of the chair and picking at the Butterbeer label on the bottle. It came away easily in his fingers and revealed there was a second label underneath the first. It read: Madam Mertle's all-purpose cleaning solution, now with a fresh pumpkin and mint scent. "I think that counts as one-nil."Lee was snoozing quite happily in his bed, tucked in beneath the warm folds of the blanket, when a slightly unnerving sound broke through the haze of his sleepy dream and woke him. It was the sound of stifled giggling. Opening one eye he made out the shape of someone creeping around the bedroom. A few seconds later, accompanied by much blinking, Lee realised that it was, in fact, Fred."Shh," said Fred, when he noticed his friend was awake, before carrying on with what he was doing previously.Lee sat up in bed and watched as his friend scuttled around George's bed and seemed to wedge something under the bottom of the blankets before returning to the cupboard by his own bed where he pulled out a large cream topped pie."Where did you get that?" whispered Lee."Kitchens, and shh," ordered Fred, who pulled out his wand, pointed it at the pie, and performed a levitating spell. As the pie slowly floated its way across the room, Fred got back into bed. Gradually he guided the pie over to his brother's bed where he kept it stationary above George's face. Fred looked over at Lee and counted down from five with his hand.Suddenly there was a loud crackling sound as the firecrackers Fred had stowed under his brother's blankets erupted into life. George sat bolt upright and planted his face squarely into the pie."What the…" shouted George as the firecrackers petered out. He pulled the pie off his face, wiped his eyes clean, and looked around the room. He saw Lee who just pointed over at Fred's bed where the occupant was now pretending to sleep. "I thought we agreed not to start the pranking until at least after breakfast.""You just had pie for breakfast," mumbled Fred with his eyes still closed. "And that's one-all now.""Git," muttered George, he leaned over the side of his bed and picked up an old t-shirt which he used to wipe his face. "What time is it?""Just after eight," said Lee, looking at the clock."Where's…" said George pointing at the other two beds in the room which were currently unoccupied."They're sleeping on the floor in one of the other rooms," explained Lee. "No one is dumb enough to stay around you two on your birthday.""Except you," said Fred, his voice muffled from his pillow.George looked over at the clock above the doorway for a few moments. The second hand was gradually ticking its way around the face, and ten seconds before it was ten past eight, George began counting down silently to himself."Oh god," sighed Lee, placing his hands over his ears expectantly."Oh god what?" asked Fred, lazily before realising something was wrong. He opened his eyes just as his brother finished counting.The whole left side of Fred's mattress suddenly inflated sending the boy flying across the room and onto the floor."Ow," muttered Fred in a crumbled heap. He propped himself up onto his elbows and looked at his brother. "I thought you were waiting until after breakfast.""I just had it remember," said George, pointing to his face where the odd piece of pie still remained. "I believe that makes it two-one to me.""I should have gone home for the holidays," said Lee, shaking his head and lying back down."Where is everybody?" asked Fred as he, George and Lee made their way down to the Common Room after showering and changing into their clothes. He caught sight of himself in a mirror and ran his hand through his now black hair, which had been the result of George switching out his brother's shampoo for some Mrs Odlum's All Purpose Colour Change Solution. "You know what? I think I can make this work. How long will it last again?""Three more washes I think," said George, looking around the room. "So that means at least four months.""Could you maybe not open your mouth so wide?" said Lee, waving his hand in front of his nose."It's not my fault," muttered George, holding his hand over his mouth. He pointed a finger at his brother. "Blame him.""Ghoul toothpaste," said Fred. "Smells like death.""I can tell," said Lee. He nodded at George. "Just don't stand near any open flames. You'll probably explode.""If he did would that count as an extra point to me?" said Fred hopefully."Nope, each prank only counts for one point," said George, wagging a finger at his brother. He sniffed and grimaced. "Seriously, is there anything I can do to get rid of this?""Well, if you want I could give…" started Fred, before his brother interrupted him."On second thoughts forget it. I don't think I could risk taking anything else from you," said George. "So what are we at now? Four-three?""Four-all isn't it?""Really? I thought it was…" George paused while he mentally reached a total. "Oh yeah, I forgot about the…" He pointed down at his feet. On his right foot he wore a normal shoe but on the other he had one of his slippers, which was inexplicably rather wet. "What did you use for the glue? It's still not budging even after the shower.""I don't really know," admitted Fred. "I made it in potion's class. It was supposed to be a Laughing Potion but I must have mixed something in by mistake. It sticks to everything. Unless you know the trick to getting it off of course?""Don't suppose you want to tell me?""I'll tell you tomorrow. Unless you want to declare me the winner now and save time?""No chance.""Didn't think so, " said Fred. He looked around the room. "Seriously, where is everyone?""They're avoiding you two," said Lee. "No sensible person would dare being around you two on your birthday in case they get caught by one of your pranks.""That explains why you're here," said Fred, smiling. "So breakfast? Or shall we just drop down to the kitchens later for a mid-morning snack?""We could do both," said George, sitting down on the three-seater couch in front of the fire and stretching himself across it length-ways."And you're expecting them to serve you up here do you?" said Fred."I'm tired. I was hoping one of you would bring it up.""Yeah, that's just never going to happen," said Lee."How about we have a little wager? Loser brings the food up," said George, plumping one of the cushions with his fists before resting his head back down."I could go for that.""What do we wager?" asked Lee."Here," said George, putting his hand into his pocket. He pulled out a red dice. "We can use this. Highest number wins. I'll go first.""Hang on," said Fred. He scooped up the die as it rattled across the table. "I'll go first, then Lee, then you." He rolled the die and watched as it came up as a six. He handed it to Lee, who then rolled a five. He handed it to his brother."Damn it," said George. He lazily rolled it onto the table and called out 'four' before it could finish its journey. It landed on a four. "How did you know it was a trick dice?""You're my brother, remember? Besides, I bought you that for Christmas.""Really? I thought that was Charlie," said George."Nope," said Fred, smiling. He patted his stomach. "I'll have a full English for breakfast if you don't mind, and get extra sausages will you?""Fine," said George, he waved a hand towards the closest armchair. "Make yourself comfortable and I'll bring them up in a minute.""And a fresh pot of tea as well," said Fred. He was about to sit down on the chair his brother had pointed towards but something stopped him. He looked over at George and could see he was only pretending to have his eyes closed and was carefully peeking out. Fred sidestepped the armchair and elected to sit on the one the other side of his brother, while Lee took the vacant chair."What the...?" said Lee. As he had sat down the chair had collapsed underneath the boy, sending him sprawling onto his back."Damn," muttered George, he swung himself upright and pulled some things out of his pocket, which he threw down onto the table. There were several nuts and bolts. "I'll go get the breakfast.""Hey!" said Lee, who had eventually managed to right himself. "What was that?""I'll tell you what it wasn't," said Fred, smiling. "It wasn't five-four. Still all-even George.""Yeah I know," said George, sighing. "Could we even call it half a point?""Half a point for pranking Lee," said Fred, rubbing his chin thoughtfully."No chance," said Lee, grumpily. He made his way over to the couch and carefully lifted the seat cushion with the tip of his shoe to make sure there was nothing dangerous. Once he was happy it was safe he sat down. "I told you, I'm not having anything to do with this, okay?""Fine," said George, disappearing out of the Common Room."I'm surprised with you," said Fred, settling into his seat. "I thought you would up for a bit of pranking.""Normally yes," said Lee, stretching himself over the couch in the same way George had done previously, "when it's Filch, or the Slytherins, or Percy, just as long as it's not me.""You wouldn't be pranking yourself.""No, but you and George would be pranking me. There is nothing I could come up with on my own that would be anywhere near as horrible as you two could come up with together.""Now you're just being kind," said Fred, pretending to be bashful."There was something that surprised me though," said Lee, putting his hands behind his head and closing his eyes."Oh yeah? What's that?""Well the whole idea of today is that you and George will prank each other nonstop until midnight, or someone gives up, right?""Yeah.""And both of you will look for any opportunity to prank the other?""Right.""And you are both keeping an eye on the other to try and spot any pranks that the other has set up?""Yep.""And you've just sent George down to go and collect breakfast for you to eat?""Ah…" said Fred, leaning forward in his seat. After a couple of seconds he stood up and made his way towards the portal. "Maybe I'll just go and help him dish up.""Thought so," said Lee with his eyes still closed. "Make my eggs scrambled, okay?"Despite three or four trips to the Infirmary, numerous complaints from other students, and at least one lengthy lecture from McGonagall (which included detention for the twins), the pranks continued throughout the day, into the afternoon, and well into the night. Lee and his two friends sat waiting in the Common Room just as they had twenty-four hours previously. Except this time their appearance were a bit difference; Fred, along with his dyed black hair, was sporting one black eye, an arm in a sling, and three rather unsightly large green boils on the side of his face which looked like they would burst at any minute. George, still with a slipper stuck to one of his feet, had a bandage wrapped around his head and another around three of his fingers on his right hand, a large purple bruise on his left arm, and a large amount of hair growing out of his ears."Look Lee," said Fred, turning to his friend who was huddled under a large blanket with only his eyes visible, " we said we were sorry.""I don't know who you're talking to," mumbled Lee's voice from beneath the covers. "I'm pretty sure I said I didn't want to talk to either of you, so you can't be talking to me can you? Because I'm not talking to you.""To be fair, you said you weren't talking to us," countered George, "you didn't say we couldn't talk to you. And we are both really sorry.""Really sorry," added Fred before waiting a few seconds to continue, "even though I technically didn't do anything wrong.""Hey, don't blame this on me," complained George."It was your spell.""Yeah, aimed at you. Not my fault you stepped out of the way at the last minute.""What did you expect?" said Fred, shaking his head. "I wasn't going to let you use a spell on me. Besides it would have been embarrassing if that had got me.""Enough," snapped Lee, before he calmed his voice down to an even tone, "let's just get to midnight and talk to Enoch. Then I'm going to go to bed and pretend that this whole day didn't happen. And I want you two to do the same.""Yeah, fifteen-all," said George, nodding, "I can't believe it ended in a draw.""It's almost like we shouldn't had bothered in the first place.""Maybe you should remember that for next year," muttered Lee."Maybe," agreed Fred. He looked over at his brother and shook his head dismissively."It's nearly time," said George, flicking his eyes up at the clock which read two minutes to midnight.The boys waited in silence. It was Lee who spoke first."Just why here though? Why did you have to do it in the Common Room, when it was really crowded? Why not one of the corridors? We're always in empty corridors.""I know Lee," said George."Angelina was sitting right next to where I was standing.""Sorry Lee," said Fred."Who… who even thinks of doing something like that.""Really sorry Lee," said George."'Accio trousers'? Why?" grumbled Lee, shaking his head forlornly."I didn't think they'd rip away," explained George, "just thought they might… you know… wedge.""They were old. Should have thrown them away ages ago. They were comfy, you know?"The twins nodded in agreement as the three boys lapsed back into silence. They watched the time tick away on the clock."And the one day you decide not wear underpants," said Fred.

"Great, you're there," said Enoch, who's head had emerged through the fireplace just as the clock struck midnight. "I wasn't sure if you'd understand my message.""You know us, Uncle, there's nothing we don't understand," said George, huffing onto his fingernails and rubbing them against his shirt."I remember quite a few of your homework essay's that would contradict that," said Enoch. He frowned for a few seconds. "What happened to you two? Did you get attacked again?""Oh this?" said Fred, waving his damaged arm in his sling. "A birthday present from George.""Of course," nodded Enoch who, like most relatives of the Weasley's knew the dangers of being around the twins on their birthday. "I had planned on being there for it, but travelling has been a bit slow.""How come?" said Lee."Hello Lee, thanks for the message," said Enoch. "Good thinking about you sending me the message and not the boys. Can't be too careful. That's why it's taking me so long to get back to Britain. Every time I travel using magic it doesn't take long for that Valek guy to show up. I'm assuming it's him. There can't be that many people out there that want to kill me this badly. Three, maybe four, at most. Not more than five anyway.""Can he do that? Track your magic?" asked George."It's possible. Wizard and witches have the Trace on them until they are seventeen, that way the Ministry will know about any underage magic, and I've heard of some wizards having the Trace placed on them when they are older as punishment for some crimes. But those are very rare, temporary, and part of the spell involves consent, so I don't think it is the same," said Enoch, shaking his head. "I've been using Muggle travel mainly and it seems to be working. Anyway don't worry about me, I'm more worried about you. Have there been any further attacks?""No, not since the one we told you about," said George. "We even had two Aurors come down and search the Forest for a week.""Aurors?" said Enoch."Well one Auror and one Auror-in-training," said Lee."The Ministry's official position is that Kosa are extinct. I'm surprised they would acknowledge their existence by sending an Auror. Which one was it?" asked Enoch."Lexington," said Fred. "Although he wasn't here officially. In fact he said he'd get into trouble if the Ministry thought he was looking for Kosa.""Lexington," nodding Enoch with a smile on his face. "Good man, great Auror, if he couldn't find any trace of the Kosa in the Forest then there is a good chance it's left the area. How did you escape anyway? Lee's message didn't go into too much detail."The twins animatedly described the events of the night they were attacked by Valek, and once Enoch had clarified and, more importantly, worked out which parts the boys were embellishing, he had a much clearer picture of what had occurred."That's not good," said Enoch, once the boys had finished their tale."Us not getting killed is 'not good'?" scoffed George. "Charming.""No, obviously that part is good. The part that's not good is that there was something in the Forest that made Valek scared. There are very few things that would or should scare a Kosa and the fact that one of these is running around the Forest is a bit worrying," said Enoch, thoughtfully."Well it could have been scared of the unicorn," said Fred, scratching his chin. "Don't forget that was there as well.""Could have been but I'd rather not take any risks," said Enoch. "Do me a favour will you? Stay out of the Forest for the next while and if you're going into Hogsmeade make sure you don't wander off on your own.""Sure," said George."We promise," added Fred."No, no," said Enoch, quickly. "Don't make this like a promise you make to your mum. This isn't a 'we'll promise not to do it but we'll do it anyway because we're only actually promising we won't get caught' kind of deal. This is a 'promise you won't do it but not actually doing it' kind of promise. Understand?""Fine," sighed the twins in unison."I'm serious boys," said Enoch, sternly. "I think whatever was in the Woods scared off Valek for the time being but I would still bet he's hanging around somewhere at least. I've got a plan but I need time to get it into place but I need to know you're going to be safe.""What's the plan?" asked George."I'm going to set a trap for Valek," explained Enoch. "I'm using Muggle travel so he can't locate me, once I get to my destination I'll call in a few old favours and we'll set something up. Then I'll Apparate into the same spot. If I'm right about him having some kind of Trace on me then it should alert him to my whereabouts and bang, he'll walk straight into it and we've got him.""What if he doesn't turn up?" said Fred."If he doesn't turn up, it means that he doesn't have a Trace on me and I can just Apparate up to outside Hogwarts myself without worrying that he'll attack me right away.""How long before you can set that all up?" asked Lee."I don't know the exact date but I'd say a couple of months at least by the time everything is in place," said Enoch, he carried on before either of the twins could complain, "I know, I know, that's a long time. But I have to be careful, I'm only going to get one shot at this and I don't want to miss my chance. You're safe at school as long as Dumbledore is there and you don't take any unnecessary risks.""But two months of behaving? That'll ruin our reputations," said George, shaking his head."Would you rather be dead?" asked Lee."Er…""Well would you?" added Lee."Hang on, I'm thinking about it," said George. He let out a sigh, "I suppose not.""I only said don't go into the Dark Forest and no wandering off from Hogsmeade," said Enoch. "I didn't say you had to behave yourselves.""Oh," said George, perking up, "well that okay then.""Just be careful and watch your backs," explained Enoch. "I'll keep you informed of how everything is going okay? Let me know if you notice anything suspicious.""Like what?" asked Fred."You know… suspicious," said Enoch. "Anything weird or strange.""At Hogwarts? That could be anything.""You know what I mean. Just be careful. Take care lads," said Enoch."You too," said George."Yeah, see you," added Fred, as Lee waved bye to their old Defence Against the Darks professor."Two months and no Forest," said Fred, shaking his head after Enoch's head disappeared from the fireplace. "People will start thinking we're Percy or something.""I think it'll take more than that," said Lee. His friends looked at him quizzically. "I mean you've done plenty of rule-breaking within the school without having to go into the Dark Forest.""Aw, thanks Lee," said George, slapping his friend on the shoulder, "you really know how to cheer us up.""You know something else that'll cheer you up," said Fred, turning to look at his brother."What?""I won," said Fred, tapping his fingers against his eyebrows. "Shaving time.""Again?" said Angelina the next day at breakfast, when Lee and the twins sat down on the bench opposite the girl and her best friend Alicia. The Great Hall was packed with people so there was the usual loud hum of conversation to go along with the delicious smells wafting from each of the tables."It's hardly a surprise is it?" said George, picking up his cutlery and looking along the table to see what dishes he fancied today . "We have breakfast every day.""Well apart from when you had that weird vomiting illness thing," said Lee, stabbing a fork into some sausages as he began to load his plate with food."Oh yeah," said George, shaking his head. He grimaced at the thought. "That was not a good day for eating, or for anything that didn't involve being within dashing distance of a toilet.""No you idiots. She meant your eyebrows," said Alicia, pointing towards George's head with the end of her knife. Since he had lost the bet his face was now completely devoid of eyebrows. Fred, despite the gloating, had felt bad about this and had generously glued his brother's eyebrows onto one of the mirrors in their dormitory so when George stood the right way it gave the appearance that his reflection wasn't missing anything important. George did not think this was as kind-hearted as his brother did."What?" said George, theatrically. He picked up a spoon, looked at his reflection and recoiled in mock-horror. "Again? I take my eyes off them for one minute and… tsk honestly. Should I put up a missing poster in the Common Room?""I've given up caring at this point," sighed Angelina."Wait? So you care?" said George, attempting to wiggle his eyebrows and failing miserably since they were currently glued to a mirror several floors up in the boys' dormitory."Why? If she did care how would that make you feel? Surprised? Confused? Angry? I can't really tell," said Angelina, dryly. She mimicked each emotion as she spoke. She turned to look at a new arrival to the table. "Oh hey, Oliver. What's with the outfit?""Where were you?" asked the Quidditch captain, looking between the two girls and the twins expectantly. He was wearing his uniform and had his broom slung over his shoulder."Right here," said Alicia, indicating the table in front of them. "You know? Breakfast? Most important meal of the day.""Really?" said Fred, frowning. "Most important? Surely that's got to be lunch.""Pfft, listen to this idiot," said George, nodding towards his brother and rolling his eyes. "Lunch? Try dinner. No competition.""No, I'm going to have to agree with Alicia," interjected Lee. "Breakfast all the way. It sets you up for the day.""Ignore them," said Angelina, waving at the three boys and turning to look at Oliver. "What do you mean 'where were we'? We don't have practice until this afternoon.""Breakfast? You've just woken up, you're hurrying to class, you're fighting to stay awake. How can you enjoy any meal in that state? It has to be lunch.""Don't you remember? Last night?" said Oliver, impatiently waiting for one of his teammates to remember. "We all agreed that we'd do extra morning practices from now on until the Ravenclaw game. You can't all have forgotten.""I'm still fighting to stay awake until the afternoon. Dinner is best. Lessons are out of the way, you can relax afterwards, you can take your time and have seconds and second seconds.""No, don't remember that at all," said Alicia, shrugging her shoulders. She looked over to her friend for confirmation."Doesn't ring a bell," agreed Angelina, shaking her head."Wouldn't that be thirds?""No, Lee. Having thirds is greedy. Second seconds is just when you take what you would have had for seconds but couldn't because your plate was too full.""Seriously, you don't remember?" said Oliver, putting the end of the broom down on the ground and leaning on the handle. "We were in the Common Room discussing tactics and then one of you said 'shouldn't we be doing more training' and I said 'good idea, how about extra morning sessions?' and everyone was going 'great idea', 'nice one,' 'wish I had thought of that'.""Why don't you just fill up a second plate instead?""Two plates? We're not animals. Well Fred is, you know, for picking lunch over dinner.""Pretty sure we didn't have that conversation," said Angelina, frowning. She looked up at Oliver intently. "Are you sure you didn't just dream it or something?""No, come on stop messing," said Oliver, laughing slightly to himself. "We all agreed on the morning practices, then someone suggested we find some free time to work on tactical theory, then we were attacked by that giant flying hamster… oh hang on… okay, there's a small chance that might have been a dream.""Boys," said Angelina, shaking her head. She put her knife and fork down on the plate and swung her legs around to stand up. "You're all idiots.""Some more than others," agreed Alicia, also getting up and throwing her bag over her shoulders. She nodded at the twins and Lee who were now engrossed in the argument over which meal was the best."Sorry about that," said Oliver, scratching the back of his head. "I don't suppose you'd be interested…""No," said Angelina, wagging her finger. "Exams are only eight weeks away. No more extra practice. I won't have time to study.""But we have exams every year," said Oliver. "How can you compare that to the chance of winning the Quidditch Cup?""No," said Angelina, firmly one last time before leaving with Alicia. The other girl shook her head at her captain when it appeared he was about to appeal to her better nature instead."Doesn't anyone care about Quidditch?" said Oliver, forlornly as he watched the two girls head out of the Great Hall."I care," said Lee, compassionately. He waved a fork-speared sausage in his direction."Thanks Lee," said Oliver, turning around. "I knew I could always count… er… what are they doing?""Them?" said Lee with a mouthful of food. Fred and George where rolling around on the floor mid-scuffle. "They're fighting over which meal is best after breakfast.""After breakfast?" said George, as he stopped punching his brother in the arm."Are you mental?" said Fred, propping himself up on his elbows."I just think…" said Lee. Before he could finish his sentence his friends grabbed a shoulder each and dragged him backwards off the bench. "No, I'm not part of this. Stop it. Stop! That's it, you're dead. ""I'll er… be off then," said Oliver after a few moments of watching the three boys scrapping on the floor.The end of year exams were fast approaching, which meant that the various professors would increase the workload while encouraging more studying during the students' free time, something of which most of the children took to heart. Fred and George were not most children."Come on Lee," complained George, who was slowly jabbing his friend in the shoulder with his finger. The three boys were down in the Great Hall. Lee, like a number of other students, had a few books open in front of him and a large parchment where he was writing down notes carefully."I'll be done in a bit," said Lee, batting away his friend's hand. "Just let me get to the end of this chapter.""Or how about you just come with us now and you can finish the chapter later?" said Fred, who was sat on the other side of Lee, nudging him with his elbow."Because whenever you guys say 'come on, what's the worst that could happen?' one of us ends up in the Infirmary," explained Lee."Right," nodded Fred.Lee stopped writing and looked over at his friend. "You do know that's a bad thing right?""Er… you get to miss class and they bring you jelly and ice-cream. How is that a bad thing?""I was talking about the pain that usually comes from having to go to the Infirmary in the first place.""Pfft, details. Come on Lee, we've discovered something cool in the Astronomy Tower," said George, pleading with his friend."What?""It's cooler if we showed you," said Fred. He reached out a hand and slowly closed the book from which his friend was reading."I don't know why you are so bothered about exams anyway," said George. "I thought we'd taught you better than that.""My parents are planning on going on holiday for the summer, and they said they'd bring me with them if I get good marks. If I don't I've got to stay with my aunt Beryl.""And that's bad is it?" asked George."Imagine someone as boring as Professor Binns, as pleasant as Snape, as strict as McGonagall and as disgusting as Filch. I'd rather stay with that person than with aunt Beryl. So that's why I need to study.""Don't they say you should make sure to take enough breaks when you study," said George, slyly."That's right they do say that," agreed Fred. "That's what we're doing right now. We're just taking a break.""You do know that to take a break from studying you actually need to attempt some studying at some point?" said Lee."And we plan too," said George."We're just getting all the breaks out of the way in one go. That way we can get a good bit of studying done right at the end.""Well I suppose…" began Lee."Brilliant," said George, grabbing hold of his friend's arm and dragging him up from the table."You won't regret this Lee," said Fred, helping to usher his friend along."What about my books?" said Lee, trying to look over his shoulder."Oh they'll be there when we get back," said George, dismissively.The boys made their way to the Astronomy Tower. It was dark and poorly lit but you could still just about see where you were going. They slowly made their way up the staircase. Every few steps or so George would take out a vial from his pocket and spill a few droplets down onto the inside railing on the side of the staircase. Despite Lee's queries, neither of the twins would tell him what the liquid did until they had climbed all the way to the top of the Astronomy Tower."Right, now what?" said Lee, crossing his arms over his chest."I thought it would be obvious," said Fred. He used one hand to grip onto the railing of the staircase while he swung his leg over and straddled it. He looked like he was perched on his broom."Sliding down the banister?" said Lee in an unconvinced tone. We do that every time we have Astronomy class.""Yes," said George nodding his head. "But what we don't do is use this rather special potion." He waved the vial of liquid he had applied to railing all the way up the tower."And that is?" said Lee."It started off as an All-Purpose Polishing Liquid, but we worked out a way of giving it a bit of a kick," said George."A bit of a kick?" said Lee, uncertainly."Yes, now it's…what was the word you used, Fred?""Frictionless," said Fred, still perched on the banister. "Or at least that's what the potion book said. Frictionless. Which should mean we'll get down these stairs in record time.""Ready, Fred?""Ready, George," confirmed Fred. "One, two, three…"Fred pushed himself backwards down the stairs. He started off quickly and seemed to steadily gather pace as he whizzed towards the ground floor. George and Lee watched him as best as they could looking down the centre of the staircase. When he reached the end he disappeared from sight and there was a muted thumping sound."Fred," shouted George. "You okay?""Yeah," said Fred, his voice echoing faintly from below. "Worked perfectly.""Well then," said George, mounting the banister like his brother had done previously. "And away I go."Lee watched as his friend took the same journey as Fred. Speeding along the railing before disappearing from sight at the bottom. Lee waited a few moments contemplating whether or not he should attempt the decent. In the end the thought of the merciless teasing that he would get from his friends if they saw him walking down the stairs was enough to convince him to climb onto the banister."Here goes nothing," muttered Lee. Rather than pushing himself off like his friends he just let go.He slowly made his way down around the first turn, gradually getting faster as he went. At first it was rather fun but after a few turns he realised he might have been going a bit too fast so he tried to squeeze his thighs and hands against the wooden railing to slow himself down. Unfortunately this seemed to make absolutely no difference to his speed, in fact he continued to get faster and faster. He began panicking as the end of the stairs drew closer and closer, as he tried to work out how he was going to stop. He figured his best chance would be to try and land on his feet and skid to a halt. It was a risky plan, made even more difficult by the speed he was travelling and the fact that he was going backwards.As he rounded the last turn he readied himself. Lee shot off the end of the banister and into the air. He placed his feet down and tried to brace himself forward so as to prevent him from toppling over. He failed. Rather than gradually skidding to a halt, the sudden attempt to stop his progress resulted in him completely losing balance and sent him sprawling backwards onto his bottom. He continued rolling in a haphazard manner until he slammed into a stonewall in the corridor. Fortunately he avoided any serious damage given that both Fred and George's bodies were between his and the wall, however it did still hurt a significant amount."Ow," said Lee, sarcastically. He rolled onto his back. "Why did I expect this to go any differently?""I'm thinking we need to put something soft against this wall," muttered Fred in a pained voice."I dunno," said George, "it wasn't too bad.""That's because for you I was the something soft against the wall.""You said it worked perfectly," said George."The banister bit did. Just not the stopping. Plus I really thought I could get out of the way in time before you got down. I was very wrong," said Fred, wincing. "You okay there, Lee?""Remind me again how this is better than studying?""At least we didn't break anything," commented George."Yeah, it could be worse," added Fred."Yes, it could," agreed Filch, standing with his arms folded over his chest.





--------




Between the extra work from the teachers, Quidditch practice, and the detentions the boys received from Filch, it left them very little time to worry about Valek. In fact they had almost forgotten about him when a strange and bizarre looking bird dropped down in front of Fred and George during their breakfast. It delivered a single envelope, pecked around the table for a few moments before stealing a couple of sausages from George's plate and flying away."Hey, bring those back," complained George, shaking a fist in the air at the retreating creature."Oh no, where are you going to get more of those?" said Lee, sarcastically as he speared a sausage from a serving plate on the table with his fork. He waved it under his friend's nose. "They're such a rare food, who knows when you'll be able to taste them agai…. Oi.""What?" said George, who had taken a large bite out of his friend's sausage, and proceeded to chew it with his mouth open. "I thought you were feeding me.""Git," muttered Lee, smiling. He dumped the remaining contents of his fork onto George's plate and took more for himself. This time he didn't try to tease his friend with them."You okay there Fred?" said George, looking across the table at this brother. Fred had been trying to open the envelope since it had arrived but without any success. "It's only a letter not a… you know… something puzzlely.""Puzzlely?" said Lee, screwing his face into a frown. "You're really not at your best in the morning are you.""Well you think of a word that describes something difficult to get into.""Er…" said Lee, looking thoughtful for a few moments."See, not that easy is it?" said George. He lent over the table and took the letter from his brother. "Give it here. That's why you use a fork. Your fingers are too greasy.""I've been using a fork you dunce," said Fred, waving the piece of cutlery in the air to demonstrate. He watched as his brother tried to lift up the flap on the back of the envelope. "See? It's not just me.""Fine, I'll just rip it open," said George. He tried to tear the side of the letter open with both hands but even using all his strength it made no difference."Use a knife," advised Lee. He watched George for a couple of seconds. "Use a clean knife.""Oh, right," said George, looking down at his knife that was caked in egg yolk. He picked up a spare, slipped it into a gap in the flap and pulled the blade upwards. Then he tried a sawing motion back and forth. Finally he settled on just waving the knife in the air with the envelope stuck on the end. "Nothing.""You sure it's not just a joke envelope," said Fred."I don't think so," said George, examining the paper closely. There was nothing special about the envelope apart from it had been closed with a red wax seal. "Looks normal.""Of course it looks normal. That's the point of joke things, they look normal but they're not.""That explains you then," said George. He passed it back over to his brother. "You try."Fred struggled with the letter in the same manner as his brother for a few minutes before giving up."It's pointless, we can't open it. Look what it did," stated Fred, whose knife was now bent in half."Give it here," sighed a female voice. It was Hermione, the first year Gryffindor who was friends with Harry Potter and the twin's younger brother Ron. She had been sitting eating her breakfast near to the boys and had tried her best to ignore their antics but couldn't help herself once they could not work out how to open the envelope. She needed to give them the answer."No offense Harmony," said George, dismissively. "But if we can't open it I doubt you can.""It's Hermione, and I think I know why you can't just open it. I need to look at it to be sure though," said the bushy haired girl holding her hand out expectantly."What's the worst that could happen?" said Fred, shrugging his shoulders. He handed the girl the envelope. "It's not like she could make it harder to open.""Just as I thought," said Hermione, after turning the envelope over. She pointed to the seal on the back. "See this? It's a Secrecy Seal. They're really rare, unless you work at the Ministry I suppose. Not many private collectors would have access to one of these.""Right," nodded Fred, taking the envelope back from the girl and looking at the red mark on the back. "A Secrecy Seal.""Yes," agreed George, nodding his head. "One of those.""They were used a lot during the Goblin Wars. It's a way of making sure only certain people can open it, plus the true address and addressee is only revealed once it gets delivered, " said Hermione, trying her best to jog the boys' memories. "You would have covered this during History of Magic.""Yeah, we take more of a laid-back approach to Binns' class," explained George, shrugging his shoulders."That means they take naps," explained Lee."Well, why didn't you recognise the seal?" asked Hermione."Er… well it's always first thing, and that room is really warm.""You nap as well? Through a lesson?" asked Hermione with an expression of pure disgust. "But how do you learn anything?""I think this whole exchange has shown you that we don't," said Fred. He waved the envelope at her. "Care to give us a refresher?""Well, during the Goblin Wars the Ministry of Magic needed a way of sending correspondence that couldn't be intercepted…" began Hermione."Just tell us how to open it," said George, interrupting the girl before she could get too far into her story."With blood," said Hermione, annoyed that she wasn't allowed to complete her explanation. "This seal is designed only to be opened by close family of the writer; brother, sister, parents, uncle or aunt. That way if it gets intercepted no-one else can open it.""Uncle," nodded Fred, recognising Enoch's hand-writing on the front of the envelope."A drop of your blood on the seal will be enough to dissolve it," said Hermione, pointing to the mark. "Although I don't know why anyone would send their nephews an envelope with a Secrecy Seal. Expecting you to cut yourself just to open it? It's practically barbaric.""So should we…" said George, looking at the knife in his hand."Maybe use a pin?" said Lee. "You only need a drop of blood, not a whole pint. I think I have one upstairs.""Brilliant," said Fred, getting up to leave. He turned back to look at the first year. "Thanks Herm…atha?""Hermione," said the girl, correcting him. "It's quite a simple name to remember.""Don't worry, I won't forget it from now on," said Fred, as he followed Lee and George out of the Great Hall. On the way out they spotted his younger brother Ron and Harry walking into the room."Hi Fred, George," said Harry. "Oliver told me to remind you that there is Quidditch practice tonight.""More practice? I swear he gets worse with every year," complained George, shaking his head. "At this rate, by next year he'll have us sleeping on our brooms so we can practice while we snooze.""Your friend Herm…ity?""Hermione," said Ron, quickly. He had become used to his brothers' inability to remember his friend's name."Right, Hermione. Hermione," said Fred, trying to commit it to memory. He waved his hand in the general direction of where they had previously been sitting. "Anyway, she's down there.""Cheers," said Harry, making his way passed. "Oh, I was only able to find Katie. So let Angelina and Alicia know about the practice if you see them.""Will do," said Fred, giving the first year a salute. Once Harry and Ron were out of earshot he turned to George. "Are we going to tell them?""You want to tell Angelina we have more practice? Do you want her to throw another book at us?" said George. "Let Harry tell her, she won't hurt him. Or better yet let Oliver tell her, she'd definitely hurt him."Up in the boys' dormitory, after much rummaging, Lee managed to locate a pin in the drawer next to his bed. Unfortunately it had taken pulling the entire drawer out and dumping the contents onto his bed to achieve this."Why do you have this?" said Fred, taking the pin from his friend."My mother likes to make the adjustments to my clothes herself, she's also a bit forgetful and sometimes doesn't remove all the pins afterwards. I always have to check new clothes before I put them on," said Lee, wincing at the memory of pin pricked body parts. He began pushing the pile of clutter back into the drawer."Here you go then," said Fred, holding the pin out to his brother."Why am I doing it? You do it," said George, putting his hands on his hips."He's your uncle.""He's your uncle too idiot.""I don't want to do it.""Well I don't want to do it either.""Why not?""It might hurt.""That's why I don't want to do it.""Get Lee to do it," said George, nodding towards their friend, who had just secured the drawer back into place."I can't do it, he's not my uncle.""Oh right, silly me," said George, agreeing with his friend. He turned back to his brother. "I guess that means it's up to you.""I suppose. I mean if Lee can't then there's really only one option… hey wait a minute.""I've seen you two launch yourselves off the roof of Hagrid's house without a second thought about hurting yourselves but this you're afraid of?" said Lee, pointing at the pin in Fred's hand. "Give it here.""I hate to break it to you buddy," said Fred, looking solemn, "but you aren't a close relative of Enoch.""I mean I know a way of doing it so that it doesn't hurt," said Lee, taking the pin from Fred. He grabbed hold of his friend's hand, and gripped his thumb securely. "Don't squirm.""Why do I have to do it?" complained Fred, as his brother smiled."Because you're the closest," said Lee, holding the pin above his friend's skin. "On the count of three.""Is that one, two, go on three? Or one, two, three, then go," said Fred."Three," said Lee, quickly jabbing the pin into his friend's thumb before he could react. A small droplet of blood formed on the boy's skin. "See? Didn't hurt too bad did it?""Oh. Barely felt it," said Fred. He looked at his brother. "Seriously, let him do it. It's less than a scratch.""Really?" said George. After couple of seconds he held out his hand and Lee pricked his thumb with the pin. George immediately winced and pulled his hand back. "Ow. That stings.""Yeah I know," nodded Fred, smiling."Then why… git," said George, placing his thumb into his mouth and sucking on the wound."Such a baby," said Lee, shaking his head. "Where's the envelope?""Oh here you go," said George, taking it from his back pocket and passing it to his brother.Fred took the letter and turned it over. He squeezed his thumb slightly so that a larger drop of blood appeared and he let it fall down onto the seal. After a few moments it slowly began to dissolve and they were able to open the envelope without any further problems. As they had guessed from the hand-writing on the envelope the letter was indeed from their uncle. It read:Dear Boys,Sorry for the use of the Secrecy Seal, I was able to locate one from by less than reputable sources and it seemed like the best way to ensure you received the letter without it being tampered with. I'm assuming you know what to do with it since you learn about them in History of Magic lessons and I of course covered them during one of my own classes with you.Anyway, I've been using Muggle transport for the most part, so the going has been a bit slow as I don't have much in the way of their money. I even experienced going up in one of their aeroplanes, you father would have loved it, they even served food which shows the main advantage that mode of transport has over brooms. Trying to eat a sandwich while the wind is whipping your face is not easy I can tell you.As I told you before my friends and I set up a trap for this Valek, since we now know we are dealing with Kosa I was able to appropriate the required equipment needed to fight him. The good news is that he fell for the trap, the bad news is that he was able to escape. The worst news is that it's unlikely he'll fall for the trap a second time. And the worst worst news is that I think he's heading back towards Hogwarts. I'm making my way there as quickly as I dare, I've sent word to Lexington in the Aurors but I don't know how long it'll take to reach him or even if he'll take any notice. My instinct says he will but my instinct also said Valek wouldn't escape my trap. Your safe within the school as long as Dumbledore is there. Kosa are evil but they are smart, Valek wouldn't risk attacking while there is someone as powerful as Dumbledore there to protect you.Stay safe boys, and don't try and fight Valek on your own.Enoch.P.S. No, seriously, don't try and fight him.P.P.S. No really, don't."Well that sounds like it went well," said George, once Fred had finished reading the letter out loud."So we have to hide in the castle while this guy waits to kill us?" snorted Fred, derisively."Sounds like a good plan to me," said Lee. His two friends looked at him. "Well, at least we have cake here.""That is true," nodded Fred, appreciatively. "But just waiting around just seems a bit… unfair.""Look, the only thing we have that could hurt him are the unicorn horns right?" said Lee."Damn right," said George. "We have two of those things. That's twice the danger.""And the only way we'd get to use them on him is if we were within a couple of feet of him.""Yep, up close and personal. Just how I like my battles," said Fred, mimicking a stabbing motion with an imaginary unicorn horn."Which means, he'll be within a couple of feet of us," said Lee, explaining further."Yeah, stare him right in the whites of his eyes," said George."I thought he had red eyes. Well red bits where the white bits should be," said Fred."You know I wasn't really paying attention at the time.""You're not getting it are you?" sighed Lee, trying to prevent his friends' conversation to wander away from him. "If we're close enough to stab him with a unicorn horn, he'll be close enough to stab us with… well whatever he wants.""Oh yeah," agreed Fred. "Maybe we need to come up with a better plan.""Any plan would be a better plan," commented Lee."For the moment I think we should just work on trying to perfect a bunch of indirect spells so that if we do come across Valek we'll at least have something to hit him with," said Fred."So basically a lot of extra Charms homework?" sighed Lee. "Can't we defeat him using Astronomy? I'm better at that.""Don't call it extra Charms homework," said Fred, grimacing. "It sounds too much like something Percy would say.""What should we call it then?" asked Lee."How about battle preparation?""And how are we preparing for battle?""By doing extra Charms homework… oh.""Right, so extra Charms with unicorn horns for backup. That's pretty much it," said Lee. "Plus sprint training.""You're going to run away from him?" said George. "We tried that, he's pretty fast, not sure if you'd be able to outrun him.""It's not him I need to outrun. I only need to be faster than one of you," said Lee, smiling."That's reassuring.""Mr Lexington," said George, slapping his hand to his head."No, I'm Fred, that's Lee and you're George," said Fred, tapping the side on his brother's head."Gerroff," said George, batting his brother's finger away. "Remember when he attacked Miro when we went to Diagon Alley.""No, I wasn't there," said Lee."We told you about it, didn't we? Oh well he attacked Miro as a test," explained George. "And the way he beat Miro in the end wasn't with a spell but with...""A potion," said Fred, finishing the sentence."Exactly," said George, folding his arms and looking smug. "Potions are indirect, they should work on Valek.""So now we have extra Potion homework as well as Charms? Brilliant," muttered Lee. "So basically we're studying for exams, which is pretty much what I've been trying to do for the last few weeks but you guys keep interrupting me.""Actually, I'm not sure the Charms and Potions we've learnt in class would help us much against Valek," said George. "So we're going to have to learn more advanced stuff.""On top of trying to revise everything we learned in school this last year?" said Lee."Pretty much," agreed George."Look on the bright side," said Fred."You do know you're supposed to say something after that," said Lee, a couple of seconds later. "You can't just say 'look on the bright side' and then stop talking. What's the bright side?""Er… hang on, I'm thinking," said Fred.

"Oh Merlin's Beard, why don't I even remember covering this the first time around?" muttered Lee. He was hunched over a large book in the library and frowning as he failed to recognise anything on the page."Er… I think you were in the Infirmary that day," said Fred looking over his friend's shoulder. He took a book from one of the shelves and passed it to his brother."Yeah, definitely in the Infirmary. You burnt your hand in Potions and missed the lesson," said George. He placed the book carefully on top of a stack he had been building for the last half an hour. It nearly reached the top of the shelves and the boy had to climb up makeshift steps, also made from books, to reach the summit."I like how you can't remember to bring your schoolbooks to class but you can remember every time I've had to visit the Infirmary this year," said Lee."Actually it's not your visits to the Infirmary we remember but the detention we received from Snape for accidentally blowing up your cauldron," said Fred."Accidentally?" said Lee, sceptically."No, no, it was definitely accidentally," said George, wagging a finger at his friend."Yeah, we were aiming for Bickerstaff's cauldron," nodded Fred. "You need to put it more to the left, it's starting to look like it's leaning.""Really?" said George standing back to get a better look at his creation."Aren't you supposed to be studying or working on your Charms for Valek?" said Lee, rereading the same sentence he had been trying to commit to memory for the last five minutes without success."We are," said George."We're just taking a break," added Fred."To take a break from something don't you first need to be doing it?" said Lee."We're a team Lee, you're studying and we're taking a break. Teamwork," said George, placing another book on his tower."Well when Madam Pince sees you making that," said Lee, pointing a finger at the stack of books, "we are most definitely not in a team. You can take that punishment all by yourself.""Don't say that Lee," said George, trying to balance a rather large and heavy looking book on its edge."Yeah, Pince hardly ever comes down this way," said Fred. "That's pretty much the only reason we're here.""In fact, if you didn't need that book, we probably wouldn't be here at all," said George."Why are you here at all?" said Lee. "It's not like you're studying or anything.""I told you," said Fred, "we're on a break.""Besides," said George, still fidgeting with the heavy tomb, "who would build Saint George's Tower? I don't see anyone else lining up to do it.""Saint George's Tower?" said Fred."Sounds better than just George's Tower," conceded George, shrugging his shoulders. "Oh. Look out."The heavy book that George had been trying to balance toppled over and fell off the stack of books. He reached desperately for it but his fingers closed around nothing but empty air. The book spun through the air as it fell. Lee looked up and only had time to open his eyes wide in surprise before it hit him squarely on his forehead. He rocked back in his chair for a moment before collapsing face first into the open book in front of him."Oooo, sorry about that Lee," said George. "Er… Lee?""Yep," said Fred, examining his friend. "He's knocked out.""We should probably take him to the Infirmary," commented George."You get his arms, I'll get his legs," said Fred."Why should I get his arms?""It's your fault.""I guess," said George, grabbing his friend by the arms and pulling him from the chair. "I wonder if Pomfrey has his usual bed ready?""You know I think he's getting heavier," said Fred, as he picked up his unconscious friend's feet."It's the school food," nodded George, "he's always much easier to carry at the start of the year.""He does seem to get knock unconscious a lot.""He really should be more careful," agreed George."I'm not sure we're going to be able to carry him all the way to the Infirmary," admitted Fred as they made their way down the stacks of the library. They passed a couple of first years who gawked at the prone body between them."It's what happens when you study too hard," said George to the younger students."Your head gets too full," added Fred. The first years looked at each other, then at Lee, then decided that they were probably done studying for the day and began to pack up their bags."Can we put him down for a minute?" said George. "My arms are getting tired.""Hang on," said Fred. "I have a better idea."Madam Pomfrey sat at her desk in the Infirmary carefully completing the notes on her latest visitor. She frowned slightly as a strange squeaky sound interrupted her train of thought. She stood up and went to the double doors at the entrance to the Hospital Wing and pulled them open. She let out a sigh."Hello Madam Pomfrey," said Fred, smiling. "Thanks for getting the door.""Why is Mr Jordan in a wheelbarrow?" said Pomfrey, holding her hands on her hips. In all her years at Hogwarts no one had visited the Infirmary as much as the three boys currently in front of her."He's kinda heavy," explained George."Helloooo Padam Mompfrey, so glad you could make it to my party," said Lee, in a woozy dreamy voice, before his head collapsed back down."We told him it was his birthday and we were giving him a little ride around the castle," said Fred, in answer to Pomfrey's quizzically raised eyebrow."Bring him in," said Pomfrey, shaking her head and waving the boys inside. "Over to that bed there."Once they had lifted their friend onto the bed, the school nurse began her examination."So, are either of you going to tell me what happened? Or am I going to have to put up with another cockamamie story?" said Pomfrey, as she shined a light from her wand into each of Lee's eyes in turn."Cockamamie?" said George, frowning. "I don't think we've covered them in Magical Creatures yet.""It's not a creature, it means silly, made up, absurd. As in 'what absurd story are you going to tell me happened this time'?""To be fair, I'm pretty sure we've always told you the truth on how we injured ourselves," said Fred."Yeah, mainly because most times Filch has already caught us doing something wrong," agreed George."Actually you are right about that I suppose," conceded Pomfrey. She shook her head, "sorry, it's nothing to do with you. Just someone else who would rather lie about how they were injured rather than let me treat the wound properly. Honestly, doesn't think I've ever seen a dog bite in my life.""Er… what? It's not a dog bite," said George, pointing at his friend."We were in the library and a book landed on his head," said Fred."A book? Did this?" said Pomfrey, nodding at Lee who was now muttering 'la la la' to a tune only he could hear."It was a pretty big book," said George."And it fell off a pretty bit shelf," added Fred."I don't know why Irma insists on keeping heavy books so high up," said Pomfrey. "I suppose he was trying to get it down and it fell on him.""Something like that," said Fred."Well I'll have to keep him in overnight, just to keep an eye on him, but he'll be fine. Just a little concussion, nothing worse than a normal game of Quidditch," said Pomfrey, finishing up her examination. "You can stay for a few minutes if you want while I update his file.""I doubt he would even notice if we left," said George."I doubt he would notice if we suddenly started shooting sparks out of our…""Ron?""No, bums. Out of our bums," corrected Fred."No," said George, pointing across the room. "Ron."Fred turned around and sure enough their younger brother Ron was lying down in one of the beds."Alright Ronald," said George, sauntering over and sitting down on the end of the boy's bed."What you in for?" said Fred. "They finally going to do something about that thing on your neck?""What thing?" said Ron, sitting himself up in his bed. He reached his hand up to his neck and felt it."You know? That thing," said Fred, pointing. "Your head.""Very funny," said Ron, putting his hand down. He lifted up his other one which was heavily bandaged. "I'm in here for this.""What did you do? Slam it in a door?" asked George."I know, he did it on purpose to get out of all that studying Her…Herm… Hermany is making him and Harry do," said Fred, stumbling over the name uncertainly."Oh yeah, I looked over her shoulder the other day and saw she'd drawn out a study schedule for you three, she's worse that Oliver with Quidditch practice," agreed George."No, I got bitten," said Ron. "And her name is Hermione.""Wait? She bit your hand," said George."I know I haven't much experience with the ladies but it doesn't sound like you're doing it right.""Yeah, it's not very romantic," said Fred. "But hey, you aren't as blessed in the looks department as me and George so you're going to have to take it where you can.""What? Ew. No, you idiots. Hermione didn't bite me. Something else did.""Harry?" said George, uncertainly after a few seconds. "Cos, he can do better.""Ron or Harry?""Harry can do better, obviously.""It was…" Ron looked over towards Madam Pomfrey before leaning forward and lowering his voice, "a dragon." He lay back onto the pillow and waited for his brothers' amazed responses."Look, if you don't want to tell us that's fine," said George flatly."What? I did tell you," said Ron."Yeah right, a 'dragon' did it," said Fred, snorting derisively. "And I suppose it did it because you were fighting it.""I'm telling the truth.""If a dragon bit you then you wouldn't need a bandage because you wouldn't have an arm anymore," explained Fred."It's a baby dragon, just hatched. Hagrid has it in his hut.""His hut? That's made of wood? Yeah right," said George. "No one would be that silly.""Come on," said Fred, tapping his brother on the shoulder with the back of his hand. "Dinner will be starting.""Yeah we'll leave the dragon fighter to rest," said George. "See you later Ron.""Yeah, whatever," mumbled Ron."He can be so touchy," said Fred."I don't know why, we're nothing but nice to him," said George. He waved at their friend as they passed his bed. "See you Lee.""Yeah get well soon," added Fred."Night mum," said Lee before collapsing unconscious again."He'll be fine," said Pomfrey, reassuringly. "As I said I'll keep him overnight to be sure but he'll be right as rain tomorrow."The twins made their way out of the Infirmary, passing Harry and Hermione who were presumably on there to see Ron, and headed back towards the Great Hall. They could smell the wafts of delicious food before long which made their stomachs growl loudly at the prospects of being fed. The two boys found some seats opposite Angelina and Alicia and sat down before beginning to pile stacks of food onto their plates."Lee not hungry?" said Alicia, after a while."He's really studying loads," said Angelina, shaking her head. "He has to stop to eat at least, there's such a thing as too much studying.""That's why we don't study. Wouldn't want to risk doing too much," said George, tapping the side of his head with his finger."I doubt you would ever be at risk of that," countered Angelina."Nah, Lee's in the Infirmary," said Fred, waving a hand in the general direction of the Hospital Wing."Why? What did you do to him this time?" asked Alicia, putting her fork down."What? Nothing. It wasn't our fault this time," said George, defensively. Angelina gave him a look. "Mostly. It wasn't mostly our fault this time.""What happened?" sighed Angelina."He got hit on the head with a book in the Library," said George, pointing to the back of his skull."You three are the only people that could get injured in the Library," said Alicia."Hey, have you ever been in the Restricted Section?" said Fred. "Some of those books are pretty dangerous.""And were you in the Restricted Section?" asked Alicia."That's not the point," replied Fred. "The point is that… is… what's the point?""No idea," conceded George."Well I'm glad that's been cleared up then," said Angelina."What happened with your brother?" asked Alicia. "I saw him earlier and his hand looked like it was about three times the size it should be and green.""No idea," said George. "He wouldn't tell us.""Probably worried you'd end up telling the rest of the school," said Angelina."I'll have you know we are very good at keeping secrets," said Fred."Yeah," said George, "we've never told you about Lee's stuffed bear that he keeps under his pillow in case he has a bad dream.""Well I'm very good at keeping secrets," said Fred, quickly."Actually you already told us about that," said Alicia, looking at George before pointing at his brother, "and you were the one that told us.""Oh really?" said Fred, looking thoughtful. "I'm sure there is something we haven't told anyone.""Erm…" said George, stroking his chin. "Aha, what about that thing about that certain someone that ended up being whatcha-ma-called-it and it turned out to just be a thingy-me-bob?""What?" said Angelina, Alicia and Fred in unison."You know," said George, nodding pointedly at his brother. "That thing, about someone, that ended up being whatcha-ma-called-it, and it was just a thingy-me-bob.""Nope, could not understand you any less even if you were speaking Goblin," said Fred."The rash, on Percy's neck, he made dad rush him down to St. Mungo's, and it turned out to be strawberry jam from a sandwich you'd left in his bed," explained George slowly."Oh yeah, I remember that," said Fred. He turned to the girls. "Yeah, he was really embarrassed about that and told us to keep it a secret and we never told anyone about it.""Apart from right now," said Angelina."Oh…" said Fred, frowning. "Huh. Turns out we're pretty bad at keeping secrets. Who knew?""Pretty much everyone who's ever met you," said Alicia.

Lee only spent the night in the Infirmary as Madam Pomfrey had predicted, and the school nurse ushered him out of his bed the moment she deemed him well enough to move. This was rather inconvenient to Lee since he realised that being confined to a bed meant that he was able to get much more exam revision done that he would have normally. Mainly because there was less chance of him being distracted by either of the twins, which is what happened most times he tried to study, although it didn't stop him from trying in the following days."Just let me finish reading this," said Lee, holding his finger up. He had located a quiet spot in a corridor off of the Entrance Hall. The twins had just arrived on their way to their Charms lesson."Finish reading what?" said Fred, bending over his friend's book to look at the title of the chapter. "Why are you reading that? When would we need to know that?""For next lesson," said Lee. "Remember? Flitwick said he'd be giving us a quick test on this and whoever got over half of them right wouldn't get any homework.""Really? Did he tell everyone this?" said George."Yes, he said it in class, you and Fred were trying to see who could hold their breath the longest," said Lee."Oh yeah," said Fred, smiling. "Who won that again?""Both you idiots passed out.""Ah but who passed out last, cos he would have been the winner," said Fred."WHAT DID YOU DO?" bellowed a voice. The boys turned to see that it belonged to Angelina. She and Alicia were stomping towards them with angry looks etched onto their faces."I think she's talking to us," said Fred, looking over his shoulder to see if anyone was behind them that the girl could have been addressing. There wasn't."What did we do? I can't think of anything," said George, quickly."Actually we haven't done anything," said Fred, "well, nothing more than our usual stuff.""And there's no way she could be angry at us for that," said George. "Not this angry anyway. Hi Angelina, everything okay?""What. Did. You. Do?" stated Angelina, each word was said through gritted teeth."Before we answer that…" started Fred.He didn't get the chance to finish his sentence as Angelina had grabbed onto one of Fred and George's ear and began dragging them down the corridor."Ow, ow, ow, ow," said George and Fred in unison as they tried their best to keep up with the girl so as not to become detached from their ears. Lee and Alicia followed quickly behind. Lee had his hands pressed over his ears just in case Alicia decided to follow her friend's lead.Angelina pulled the boys into the Entrance Hall."What did you do?" said Angelina, letting go of their ears and holding her arms across her chest."What are you on about?" said Fred, massaging his ear with his hand."What did you do?" said Angelina one more time. She unfolded her hands and pointed up towards the four House point hourglasses that hung in the Entrance Hall. Each hourglass contained the total number of House points currently awarded to each House as denoted by a gem matching their House colours."We haven't touched those," said George. He looked up at the hourglasses and frowned. "Hang on, we're last, but we were in the lead yesterday.""Merlin's Beard guys," muttered Lee. "What did you do?""Why does everyone keep saying that?" asked Fred. He waved his hand towards the hourglasses. "This wasn't us.""Sure," said Alicia. "Someone else managed to lose us… what? A hundred or so House points? In one night? The only people that could manage that are you two.""Well I'm not saying it's something we couldn't do…" said George."I wasn't giving you a compliment," sighed Alicia."It's just we didn't do this," said George, waving his hand towards the hourglasses."He's right," said a passing second year Gryffindor with a glum look upon his face. "One of the others overheard McGonagall talking to Flitwick about it. Three first years lost fifty points each.""A hundred and fifty points in one go? Merlin's Beard," muttered Lee."Yeah," continued the second year, "the only good thing was that a Slytherin kid also lost fifty as well but there's no way we can get back in the lead. There's only four or five weeks until the end of school. Such a shame.""Did they hear which first years did it?" asked Angelina, as the second year headed off down one of the corridors."It was Harry Potter and two of his friends," said the second year, calling back over his shoulder."Harry did this?" said Alicia, looking crestfallen."Are you going to pulled off Harry's ear now?" said Fred, addressing Angelina as he rubbed his ear."Yeah, don't you have something to say?" asked George."Harry and his two friends…" mumbled Angelina before turning to the twins. "Doesn't your brother Ron hang around with Harry all the time?""You can't blame us for what Ron did," countered Fred. "Besides, I'm pretty sure he was still in the Infirmary last night."Oh I'm sure he learnt all his rule-breaking from Percy," said Angelina, sarcastically. "Come on, we'll be late to class.""Yeah, wouldn't want Snape to take house-points from us for being late. We wouldn't want to get further into last place," grumbled Alicia."One hundred and fifty points, all in one go," said Fred, still looking up at the hourglasses once the girls had left."Well, it was between three," said Lee."I know but still, that's got to be some kind of record," said Fred."We're not going to beat it," stated Lee firmly."Don't be like that Lee," said Fred, slapping his friend on the shoulder. "I'm sure if we work hard and believe in ourselves we could manage it.""I didn't mean we couldn't, I meant we shouldn't," explained Lee."But one hundred and fifty," said Fred, wistfully. "We aren't going to get an award for best exam results but this… this we could do..""Tell him George.""He's right," said George. "We'd be legends.""No, no, no," said Lee, quickly. "I meant talk him out of it.""We're already in last place, it's not like it matters," said George."Okay put it this way," said Lee. "If Angelina nearly twisted off your ears when you didn't lose one hundred and fifty points imagine what she'd do if you actually lost more.""That's actually a good point," conceded George.Although the mood in the school was generally down during exam time anyway, once the news of the lost points began to filter through to the students the atmosphere became extremely sullen. It was the worst amongst the Gryffindor students but members from both Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were also depressed since they were longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. The only House that was happy was obviously Slytherin who would clap and cheer when they saw Harry Potter walking through the corridors. Back at Gryffindor House hardly anyone would talk to the first year or the other two who had lost the points; Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom. Harry even tried to resign from the Quidditch team but Oliver wouldn't hear about it."You'd think somebody had died," whispered George in the Common Room. Usually there would be excited conversation bouncing back and forth or at least some music playing but since the night of the house-point loss everyone preferred to just sit in silence and talk in hushed tones. "I mean it's been two weeks. You'd think people would have got over it by now.""It could be worse," muttered Lee, keeping his voice low."Yeah, Percy could start trying to cheer everybody up by singing," agreed Fred."No, I mean at least we have the Quidditch Cup to look forward too," said Lee. "If we win that, everyone will be happy again.""But if we lose it, we'll be lucky if we survive until the end of term," countered George."Oh here they come," said a voice from the corner of the room. "Try not to lose us any more points while you're in detention."Everyone turned to look at the new arrivals. It was Harry, Hermione, Neville and Ron. Each of them looked sheepish with the exception of Ron who had a defiant look on his face. The four first years hadn't been seen much since the incident; Harry, Hermione and Ron spent most of their time studying in the Library while Neville preferred the solitude of his room."It's not like they did it on purpose," snapped Ron, in the general direction from where the voice had emanated."Just leave it, Ron," said Hermione. "Come on, the last thing we want to be late for Filch."Ron nodded goodbye to his three friends and made his way over to his brothers."Can you believe them?" said Ron, gesturing towards the corner of the room with his thumb. "Acting like they've never lost house-points.""Actually, I don't think he has," said George, straining his neck to look at the boy. "I think that was Tim Ichabod. He's in Percy's year, the two of them are the only ones in their year not to lose any house-points since they started at the school. They've having a competition about it.""Well he's a prat," said Ron, sitting down on the arm of George's chair."No argument here," said George. "What have Harry and the others got for detention?""No idea, but they have to meet Filch down at the Entrance Hall.""Ah well if Filch is involved then you know it's going to be no fun at all," said Fred."Yeah, they'll probably have to polish all the suits of armour or clean a bunch of portraits," nodded George. "He really likes his manual labour when it comes to detention.""I'm gonna wait up for them I think," said Ron, letting out a yawn."Well it could be a while," said Lee. "These two have never lost fifty points but some of their detentions have lasted hours. Although that could be because they were messing around when they were supposed to be doing work."Slowly over the next hour the Common Room began to empty until it was just the three Weasley boys and Lee. Eventually Lee said his goodnights and headed off to bed himself."How much longer are they going to be?" said Ron, looking up as the clock above the fireplace struck one in the morning."No idea," said George, shrugging his shoulders."It seems a bit stupid," said Fred, stretching his body. "They were caught out of Gryffindor House in the middle of the night so their punishment is to be out of Gryffindor House in the middle of the night. That would be like being caught stealing cakes and as a punishment they'd be made to eat a cake.""That's a punishment I could get behind," admitted George."No offense Ron," said Fred, looking up at the clock. "You can wait up for your friends but I don't think I can be bothered.""Yeah," agreed George, stifling a yawn. "You don't stay this good looking without plenty of beauty sleep.""I'm sure they'll be finished any minute now," said Ron."You said that an hour ago," said Fred "Besides, it's not like they did anything interesting, it's just detention. Anything they are doing we've probably already done.""Yeah, probably twice," added George. "Let us know how they got on in the morning."The next day the twins found out that Harry, Hermione and Neville had their detention in the Forbidden Forest, a fact that they found most grating since to Fred and George an entire night wandering the forest actually sounded like a much cooler adventure than their usual punishments. They didn't spend much time complaining however as the end of year exams were soon upon them. A whole year's worth of lessons and accumulated knowledge were tested in a few short days.It was sweltering hot, something which was made worse by the large stuffy classroom in which they had to do their written exams. The students were given the usual special quill which contained Anti-Cheating enchantments, this didn't stop the twins from trying to circumvent the precautions with a few of their own little inventions. This led to Fred and George having to turn out their pockets while Filch scanned them with a Secrecy Sensor before exams. With the last of the written and practical tests out of the way the boys relaxed with a short jaunt into Hogsmeade for a well-earned bottle of Butterbeer."Here's to the end of having to do exams," said Fred, holding up a bottle."To the end of the exams," said George, joining the toast."You do know we'll still have to do them next year right?" said Lee."Shut up and clink your bottle will you?" said Fred."Fine," said Lee smiling. "To the end of the exams.""Seriously? This is 'staying inside the castle' and 'keeping a low profile'?" said a voice from behind the boys."Enoch," chorused the three boys."You made it," said Fred, as he and his brother got up to hug their uncle."Nice to see you too," said Enoch, sitting down next to them. "But really, what are you doing here?""We've finished our exams, so we thought we deserved a treat," said George."I told you not to leave the school," said Enoch, reproachfully."It's the middle of the day, Hogsmeade is full, there's no way Valek would risk attacking us in broad daylight," explained George."What if he attacks you on the way back to the school? The route is pretty quiet with plenty of places he could hide in wait.""We used one of the secret tunnels," said Fred. "Popped up right in Honeydukes.""Smart thinking," nodded Enoch. He looked around the room for a moment. "I don't see any other students. Are you allowed into Hogsmeade when it's not the weekend?""Oh Merlin's Beard no," said Lee, shaking his head. "But we figured the teachers would be too busy finishing up the exams to come into the village.""Typical," said Enoch, smiling."So what's the plan? Now that you're here," said Fred."The plan is to keep an eye on things here until you two head home for the holidays," said Enoch. "Once you are safe at home, then I'll start hunting Valek down.""You're going after him?" said George, swallowing a mouthful of his Butterbeer."I have to," said Enoch, shrugging a shoulder. "He's not going to stop, so it's me or him.""He's after us too, let us help," said Fred."No chance," said Enoch, "You two are safe in the school as long as Dumbledore is there. Now that I'm here, hopefully Valek will turn his attentions towards me and when he reveals himself that's when I'll be able to take him down.""Let us help. Three against one gives you a better chance," said George."Four," said Lee."Sorry Lee, four against one," corrected George."Look, I appreciate the offer lads I really do. But the only way I'm going to defeat Valek is if I'm fully focused on the task at hand and I wouldn't be able to do that if I'm too busy worried about you three. Stay in the castle and stay safe. Now that I'm in Hogsmeade I'm going to let as many people as I can know that I am here. I still don't know if he has a Trace on me, so I'll Apparate about the place a bit as well. Hopefully this news will get back to Valek and he'll try and fight me here.""I still think you need back up," said Fred, sulkily."I've reached out to Lexington in the Auror department," said Enoch. "But I don't know if he'll be able to get up here. He's not officially allowed remember? Just get back to the school and don't do anything stupid.""Anything stupid? Have you met these two?" said Lee.Fred and George grumbled the whole way back to the castle as the three boys used the same secret tunnel to return. Once back they made their way down to the lake and spent some of the afternoon lazing next to the water while occasionally tickling the tentacles of the Giant Squid, which was basking in the warm shallows."Maybe it's for the best," said Lee as he stretched out on the grass embankment. "Enoch knows what he's doing and we'd probably only get in the way.""I know," conceded Fred, "but I just wanted to help. How often do you get to face this kind of life or death situation?""With you two? At least once a year," said Lee. "Look, no one is going to try and attack us in the school whilst Dumbledore is here, so unless you plan on wandering out into the Forbidden Forest to try and track down Valek there's no point in worrying about it.""Well…" said George, propping himself up onto his elbows."Lexington and Miro couldn't find any trace of him when they went looking, do you think you can do better?" said Lee."He's right," sighed Fred. "We don't know the first thing about tracking anyone let alone someone like Valek."The twins tried their best to relax over the course of the day and to a certain extent they managed it, but that was before Lee brought them some unsettling news regarding Dumbledore."What do you mean he's gone?" said Fred, keeping his voice low so that those sat closet to them at the dinner table couldn't hear their conversation."What do you think I mean? He's gone," said Lee. "I overheard McGonagall, he got some urgent owl from the Ministry and he's on his way to London. Probably won't be back until tomorrow at the earliest.""If Valek finds out, he'll attack tonight," said George. "And he'll come after us first.""That's what I thought," said Lee. "We have to get a message to Enoch. Where's he staying?""Er…" said George, looking over at his brother."I dunno. Probably at the Three Broomsticks," said Fred, shrugging."Right, I'll get down there and let him know," said Lee, quickly standing up to leave."Why you?" asked George."Valek isn't after me. He doesn't even know what I look like, so if he's skulking around Hogsmeade he's not going to spot me," explained Lee. "You two, go and get the unicorn horns and whatever you can think of to fight with just in case he decides to attack before I get back with Enoch.""And to think I was worried that the scariest thing I had to face today was my Transfiguration written exam," said Fred, solemnly."Er… our written exam today was Charms, not Transfiguration," said George. "I think that was what the fourth years were doing.""Oh… well that explains why I didn't know any of the questions," said Fred, scratching his chin. "Looks like I failed Charms this year then. Mum is going to kill me.""Well if you're lucky Valek will do that for her tonight," said George, slapping his brother on the shoulder. "That way you don't have to tell her you failed.""See, I can always count on you to look on the bright-side of things."

Fred and George waited in the Gryffindor Common Room for Lee to get back from Hogsmeade. He had used one of the secret passages that led out of the school to make his journey which had the unfortunate side effect of taking much longer than if he had used the route used during the sanctioned weekend visits to the village."Finally," said Fred as Lee entered the Common Room. "We were starting to get worried.""Sorry," said Lee, sitting down. He pulled the strap of a bag he was holding over his shoulder and placed it next to them on the ground. He looked around the room. It was rather busy but most people were too preoccupied with their own conversations to have noticed his arrival. "Took me ages to find Enoch, he was down at the Hog's Head.""Merlin's Beard, he must be hard-up if that's where he's staying, or did he get thrown out of the Three Broomsticks?" asked George."He's staying at the Hog's Head," explained Lee, "because he thought that was the best way to get noticed by anyone dodgy.""Sounds about right," said Fred, picturing the regular clientele of that particular establishment. "What did he say about Dumbledore leaving? Did he think Valek had anything to do with it?""He said that it's probably a coincidence but a good one.""A good one?" said Fred frowning. "How is it possibly a good one?""Because Enoch said he was going to let everyone in the pub know that Dumbledore had gone for the night," said Lee."Again… how is that possibly good?" asked Fred."Because then Valek will most likely try and attack you tonight," said Lee."Did you bump your head on the way back?" said George. "It sounds like you think Valek attacking us is a good thing.""No, Enoch explained it to me," said Lee, quickly. "The main probably we have is that we don't know when Valek is going to attack. We don't even know if he's around at the moment. But Enoch figures he at least has someone in Hogsmeade keeping an eye on things and passing him information. With Enoch back, and Dumbledore gone, tonight will be his best chance to attack all three of you at once.""See, you're saying it like that's good. But attacking us is bad. You do understand that right?" said George."Is this your way of getting back at us for the Astronomy Tower slide thing we did?" asked Fred. "Because we said sorry about that.""Actually you never said sorry for that," said Lee. "Anyway, the reason it's good is that if we know Valek is going to attack then we can get prepared.""Well we have the unicorn horns here," said Fred, patting one of his pockets."Brilliant, what else did you get?" said Lee, eagerly."There's our wands…" said George, a little uncertainly."And?""That's pretty much it," said George."I thought you were going to get a whole bunch of things ready. What about potions?" asked Lee."We hit a bit of a snag there," admitted Fred. "Snape has been really alert during his lessons so we weren't able to steal any ingredients that we could use.""That's okay," said Lee, picking up the bag he had brought back from Hogsmeade. He opened it up to show the twins. It contained a number of small bottles, each filled with a different coloured liquid. "Enoch gave these to me. All the potions we could need.""Nice one," said Fred, turning the nearest bottle so he could read the label. "Ooo Strength Potion, that's mine.""There's enough for everyone," said Lee, closing the bag. "We can go through them later when the room is empty.""Right, so we have the horns, our wands and the potions. I think we're all set," said Fred."That's not all we have," said George, looking rather pleased with himself. "I had an idea for weapons.""We're not doing that," said Fred, shaking his head."Not doing what?" asked Lee, looking between the twins."They're easy to make, easy to use, and we have all the parts we need," complained George."For what?" repeated Lee."He wants to fill our socks with a bunch of marbles so we have some kind of marble sock thing we can hit Valek over the head with," said Fred."Well that's…" Lee looked at George, "… certainly an idea.""See? Lee likes it," said George, smugly."He didn't like it. He thinks it's as dumb as I do," said Fred. "Do you have any idea how close you'll need to get to Valek to actually hit him with it?""It's still better than any weapon you came up with.""I didn't come up with a weapon.""Exactly.""No I mean I came up with the idea of using armour.""Armour?" said Lee, raising his eyebrows."We're in a castle. There's armour all around," said Fred, waving a hand in the air. "Stick on some armour and boom, he can't stab us with a knife.""No, but he could use his wand to make the armour shrink and crush us to death," said George. "Plus you know how heavy those things are, we wouldn't be able to move very fast.""Still," mumbled Fred, sulkily. "Better idea than marble-sock.""How about we just go with Enoch's plan?" said Lee."Oh he actually has a plan? You should have said something earlier," scolded George."Enoch's plan is to lure Valek away from the school down to the Quidditch pitch. He's heading down there now to start putting in traps and enchantments that'll help him during his fight.""What about us?" said George."We're to stay here.""That's a crap plan," scoffed Fred. He tapped the bag containing the potions with his foot. "Why did he give us all of these if he didn't want us to fight?""He said they were to be used if…" Lee trailed off uncertain how to finish the sentence."He loses," said George, shaking his head."What make him think he can even spot Valek in the first place? There's any number of ways he could get into the school," said Fred."He thinks that Valek will probably try and get to the school through the forest. Valek has probably never set foot in the castle before so Enoch doesn't think he would know about the secret tunnels. Once he sets his traps he's going to go to the East Bell Tower, that'll give him the best view of anyone coming out of the forest," explained Lee. "Once he spots him, he can intercept him and lead him to the Quidditch pitch.""That's it? What if he doesn't spot him, then what?" complained Fred. "We need to talk to Enoch.""Good luck with that," said Lee. "Mrs Norris is right outside the Fat Lady's portrait. There's no way you can sneak passed her at the moment.""Pfft," said Fred, dismissively waving his hand as he stood up. He made his way towards the exit. "If you think that mangy old fleabag could…""Where are you going?" said Alicia, looking up from her notes which she was skimming to check through the answers she had given on an earlier test."I was just…""No chance," said Angelina. "Two days. We have two days until our match against Ravenclaw. So for those two days neither you or your brother are going to do anything that could land you in detention.""Oh come on," complained Fred."She's right Fred," said Oliver, looking rather proud of Angelina. "You can't do anything that might jeopardise our chances of bringing home that trophy.""I was only…""Fred, put it this way," said Angelina, smirking evilly. "Either you move away from the door and sit back down, or we'll wrestle you to the ground and sit on you until it's time to go to bed."As if to emphasise her point, a number of the larger sixth and seventh year students stood up and crossed their arms while glaring at Fred."Alright, alright, keep your hair on," said Fred, holding his hands up. He sat back down next to his brother. "New plan, we wait for everyone else to go to sleep."Slowly, over the course of the evening, the room emptied out as people drifted off to bed. Soon the only occupants were Lee, the twins, their brother Ron and his friends Harry and Hermione. Fred and George excused themselves and took the bag of potions to their room so they could see just what they had while Lee remained in the Common Room to let them know once the others had left."Right we have two Strength potions, three Speed ones, an Endurance one…" whispered Fred, reading from the labels. "You'd think he'd use the proper names for the potions rather than just labelling them 'strength', 'speed' and 'endurance'. Look at this one 'makes things bigger – don't drink,' we know what an Engorgio potion is for Godric's sake. Oh we have two of these ones.""What's it say?" asked George"Make sure to take between potions," said Fred."Must be a Restoration potion to cancel the effects of the others.""Why cancel them? Surely being strong and fast is a good thing.""Potions react with each other. There's no telling what could happen if you took two at once. And no, now is not the time to try and find out. Hey Lee, is the coast clear?""No," said Lee, who had just entered the room. "Harry, Ron and Hermione are still up, and don't show any signs of getting tired. I say we just keep an eye on them with the Marauders' map and wait until they go to bed.""Good idea," said George, he nodded at the desk next to his bed, "it's in there.""What have we got?" said Lee, once he'd retrieved the map. "Anything useful?""No really," said Fred, waving a hand over the bottles. "I'd say Enoch is keeping the good stuff for himself.""Well he is the one planning on fighting Valek," said Lee. He looked down at the Marauders' Map. "Oh, Harry's on the move. Just the other two to go… oh three. Neville Longbottom is down in the Common Room as well. Didn't even notice him. Looks like Enoch has finished down at the Quidditch pitch, he's already up at the Bell Tower.""Right, as soon as the Common Room is clear we head down," said Fred."Merlin's Beard, now Harry's back," said Lee, shaking his head. "At this rate it'll never be empty. Hang on. It looks like… yep. Harry, Ron and Hermione have just left.""Right, Longbottom won't be far behind," said Fred, starting to put the potions back into the bag. "Took them long enough to get tired.""No, I don't mean they've gone to bed," said Lee. "I mean they've left the Tower. They've gone into the school.""Seriously?" said George, looking over at the map. "Well, well. Nice one Ron. Good to know he's not following in Percy's footsteps.""Wonder where they are going?""Probably just exploring the castle like we used to," said Fred. "Come on, we need to get to Enoch.""The corridor is clear but Neville is still in the Common Room," said Lee."He'll be fine, he just watched the other three leave so it's not like he'll mind us going," said Fred.The three boys made their way down to the Common Room where they found Neville lying prone on the floor."Er… are you okay?" said George, looking down at the boy. Neville didn't move."Looks like a full Body-Bind curse," said Lee, after a few seconds. He dug out his wand and performed the counter-cure to remove the effects from Neville's body."T-t-thanks," said Neville, as they helped him to his feet."What happened?" asked Fred."It's Harry, Hermione and Ron," explained Neville. "They went through the portrait. They're going to get Gryffindor into more trouble we have to stop them.""Sorry Neville, but we've got our own thing to do," said George, slapping a hand on the younger boy's shoulder."Wait, you were heading outside as well?" asked Neville. "You can't. We have to go and get the others and bring them back here. Then we all stay inside the Tower.""It's not that simple…" began Fred."Yes it is. It's easy not to break the rules. We just stay inside," said Neville, raising his voice."Well I suppose there is one easy solution," said George, looking over at Lee and nodding towards the first year."And what's that?" Neville asked. He looked at George, then to Fred, then began to turn to look at Lee."Petrificus Totalus!" said Lee, pointing his wand at Neville."Not again," managed Neville before his arms and legs went stiff as a board. He toppled forward and Fred and George caught his body before it hit the ground. They gently lowered him onto the floor before turning him over onto his back."Sorry about this," said George."Here, this'll help," said Fred, taking a cushion from one of the chairs and placing it under the boy's head. "Sorry.""Sorry," added Lee, before the three boys made their way out the Fat Lady's portrait.The trio made their way through the school using the secret corridors and pathways for the quickest route down to the East Bell Tower. With their wands out and illuminating the way, every shadow cast by a statue or ornament looked like a potential enemy ready to attack. They only relaxed once they reached the Tower."He's not here," said Lee, looking around."Must be on the battlements outside," said Fred. He pointed towards a door. "This way."The door led to a corridor that in turn led to a tightly spiralling stone staircase which led out onto the battlements that ran either side of the two Bell Tower. They stepped through the door into the outside air."Don't move, or I'll curse you," commanded a voice."It's just us," said Fred, holding his hands up. George and Lee poked their heads out to the side behind him."Merlin's Beard," said the voice, which turned out to belong to Enoch. "What are you three doing here?""We're your back-up," said George, waving his wand."I already have my back-up," said Enoch, nodding over his shoulder. Behind him on the battlements stood the Auror, Lexington, and Miro. Miro was busy looking through a telescope so only acknowledged them with an offhanded wave."Extinguish those wands," commanded Lexington. "Do you want everyone to spot us?""Sorry," said Fred as he turned off the light from his wand. George and Lee did the same."I told you to tell them to stay inside Gryffindor House," Enoch said to Lee."That's what I said, but you know what they are like," said Lee."We didn't know they would be here," said Fred, pointing at Lexington and Miro. "We didn't want you fighting on your own.""That's commendable," admitted Enoch. "Commendable, but foolish.""Sounds about right," said Lee, under his breath."You've got to get back to your House straight away before Valek arrives," said Enoch. "It'll be dangerous for anyone to be out tonight especially children.""There might be a problem with that," said Fred. "There's at least three other students in the school.""What? Who?" said Enoch, rubbing his forehead."Some first years, probably just exploring the castle now that the exams are over," said George."Right, well you need to find them and get them to safety…" started Enoch."I see something," said Miro, still looking through the telescope. He handed it to Lexington and pointed. "Over there, just coming out of the Forest now.""Can't tell from this distance but I'd bet my last Galleon that's him," said Lexington. He handed the telescope to Enoch, pulled himself up onto the battlements and stepped off the edge."What in Godric's name…?" baulked George. He craned his neck over the side fully expecting to see Lexington smashed on the stones below, instead he watched as the Auror floated the last few feet to the ground and landed safely on his feet."Feather-Fall Spell," explained Miro, taking out his wand. "It's rather tricky, I heard one wizard tried it but was only half successful. Ended up conjuring a bunch of feathers.""Which he landed in safely?" said Lee, sounding hopeful."Which were used to help mop up the blood," said Miro. He too climbed up and pitched himself over the side of the battlements."I've got to go," said Enoch. He handed Fred the telescope. "You can keep an eye on us with this. We'll lure him over to the Quidditch pitch. From here you should be able to spot us all the way until we get to the pitch. When we kill him we'll send up red sparks. If you see anyone coming towards the school from the pitch before you see red sparks… that means it's Valek and that probably means it's not good news for us. If that happens get those first years and get back into Gryffindor House, using the paintings to send a message to the teachers and stay inside. He can't get passed the Fat Lady without a password. But you'll need to be quick. He won't know the layout of the castle but he's met you and that means he knows what you smell like and that's enough for him to be able to track you down.""We should help…" said George but his uncle cut him off."This is helping, you'll be helping those first years," said Enoch. "Please do this. I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you. Best of luck.""You too," said Fred, as Enoch vaulted the battlements and disappeared into the night. Fred held the telescope up to his eye. "I can see them and Valek too. Damn, looks like he avoided going near the Whomping Willow, that would have made everyone's life easier if he'd walked into that.""Here," said George, taking out the Marauders' Map. "We can track them on this as well."He activated the map and stared at it for a few moment. "Yep, there's Enoch and the others. Valek's not showing but that's not surprising since the map must count as direct magic.""That's okay I've got my eyes on him," advised Fred."We have another problem," said Lee, examining the map with his friend."Just the one?" asked Fred, continuing to look through the telescope."Yes but this one has three heads. You remember that giant dog we found?""Yep, old three-head himself," said Fred."Well guess where Ron and his friends are?" said Lee, tapping the parchment with his finger."I'm guessing not back in their beds in Gryffindor Tower," sighed Fred."Not even close," said George, shaking his head. "It'll scare them off, hopefully.""Or they'll disappear," said Lee. The three footprints that had shown Ron, Harry and Hermione had just vanished from the page. "That can't be good can it?""You don't think it… ate them?" said George, looking extremely pale all of a sudden."No," said Lee, quickly. He pointed at the map. "Look, that's the dog…called Fluffy. Seriously, Fluffy? Anyway, before they disappeared there was a bunch of tiny zees above his head. That means he was asleep just before they went. They must have found something in that room that hasn't been mapped so they don't appear on it. Trust me, they're fine. Just missing and probably trapped there now that Fluffy is awake. But still safe.""While a crazy, immune to magic, assassin is on the school premises," clarified George."Yeah, when you say it like that it doesn't sound too good.""Looks like Enoch is about to reach Valek," said Fred, pointing his finger.George and Lee stood up and looked over in the direction Fred had indicated. Between the distance and the fact that it was night, they didn't hold up much hope of spotting anything without the use of the telescope, but even this far away they were still able to see the bright red and green flashes of magic as Enoch and Valek started fighting."How's he doing?" asked Lee as the lights continued."Can't really tell," admitted Fred. "They are too far away and moving too quickly to work out who is winning, but it looks like Enoch is retreating towards the Quidditch pitch like he planned. Miro and Lexington are already on their way over."Eventually Enoch made it all the way to the Quidditch pitch and disappeared from Fred's view. George and Lee went back to looking at the Marauders' Map to see if they could disseminate any clues on the progress of the fight, while Fred continued to keep an eye on the pitch itself even though he could only see the outside of the stadium."I think they have him surrounded," said Lee, pointing at the map. Only the names of Enoch, Lexington and Miro appeared but they seemed to be spread out in a triangle in the centre of the pitch."Come on," muttered George under his breath."What was that?" exclaimed Fred, lowering the telescope. A bright white flash has just emanated from the Quidditch pitch which was accompanied by an ear-splitting cracking sound."One of Enoch's traps?" said Lee."Probably," nodded George. "Who knows what he put there?""I think I see something," said Fred. He adjusted the telescope. "Yes, someone definitely coming towards the school from the Quidditch pitch.""It's him," said George, solemnly. He tapped his finger on the map. The names of Enoch, Lexington and Miro were clustered together in the centre of the pitch. "It's Valek. He's coming for us."





--------




"Right," said Lee, firmly. "We stick to the plan.""Exactly," agreed George. He fished his hand into the bag of potions before be pulled out the one he wanted. "Here, take a bit of this each.""Which one?" said Fred. His brother tilted the bottle to one side. 'Speed' was written on the label. "Good idea."George, then Fred, and finally Lee, each took a small sip of the liquid. It tasted a little bit spicy."Did it work?" said Lee, uncertainly."We don't really have time to wait," admitted George. "We have to get to Ron and make sure he's okay. Third floor corridor, right?""What about Valek?" asked Lee. "Should one of us keep an eye on him?""Good, idea. Stay here and keep an eye on him. When we find the others one of us will take them back to Gryffindor House while the other comes back for you," said George."Good luck," said Lee, nodding at his friends."Let's go," said Fred, taking off in a sprint.At first they couldn't tell if the effects of the potion had kicked in but after a few moments of running each of the boys realised they had started to run much quicker than they usually could. They were soon speeding down the corridors and passages and it took them next to no time to reach the forbidden third floor corridor."That was pretty amazing," said George, puffing to catch his breath. "I think I might need to keep some of that for when I'm late to class.""Should we try the door?" said Fred. His brother nodded in agreement. He grasped the handle and twisted. The door was already unlocked and opened with a scraping creak. Fred had barely looked inside before he slammed the door shut again. The was a loud thump on the other side that made the boys jump followed by a low growl. "The dog's awake.""Any sign of them?" asked George."No, but I think I saw a trapdoor or something. They probably went down there.""How can you be sure? That thing could have eaten them.""No chance," said Fred, shaking his head. "There's no blood anywhere. If that dog had got them the place would be covered. Trust me, they are down there and with that dog above them I'd say not even Valek would risk trying to get to them.""Well that's one less thing to worry about," said George. "Let's get back to Lee."The boys headed back the way they came, but this time there was something wrong. Instead of speeding along in a blink of an eye they just ran on at their usual pace."It's worn off already," said Fred, slowing to a stop."Probably wears off fast because it's a Speed potion," said George. He pulled the bag off his shoulder and opened it. "No, problem we'll just have some more… oh.""Oh?""Slight problem.""Which is?""All that running at high speed made all the bottles smash together and well… smash.""All of them?""Yeah," said George, looking into the bag to see if any of the vials had survived the trip. "All gone.""Careful," advised Fred as his brother went to reach a hand into the bag. "Some of those were dangerous. Might not want to get them on your skin.""Oh right," said George. He put the bag down."Just leave it here," said Fred, starting to move down the corridor. "We'll come back for them later."The twins headed back the way they came. Although it was at night and with only the lights from their wands to guide them the boys had committed to memory the various routes through the castle to such an extent that they could probably have closed their eyes and still managed to find their way. At one point however, George, who had taken the lead, stopped in his tracks and switched off the light from his wand. His brother followed suit."Shh," said George, pressing his finger to his lips, whilst leaning back against the wall."Guys?" whispered Lee, as he came around the corner."For Godric's sake," said George, letting out his held breath. "You shouldn't sneak up on us like that.""You're the ones hiding behind a corner," countered Lee."Aren't you supposed to be keeping an eye on Valek?" asked Fred."I was but he's in the school now. No point saying up there. So I decided to come and find you two," said Lee. He held up the Marauders' Map. "Where's your brother?""He's right…" began George pointing at Fred, "… oh you mean Ron. We think they are down a trapdoor in that room with the three headed dog. We thought it would be a pretty safe place to be considering who else is around.""Yeah, well we should probably get back to Gryffindor Tower," said Lee, folding the map and handing it to George. "Do you have any more of that potion? Mine stopped working.""We sort of broke the bottles," said George."Pfft, we?" snorted Fred."Let's get going then," said Lee, urgently. "We don't know where Valek is. We have to get back to Gryffindor Tower, then find a way to get a message out to the teachers. They'll be able to deal with him.""Two Aurors and Enoch couldn't deal with him," George reminded him."Maybe once he realises he can't get passed the Fat Lady he'll just leave," said Lee."Or I could just kill you right in this very corridor," said Valek as he stepped into view."Merlin's Beard, you weren't kidding about his looks," muttered Lee."Where's our uncle?" demanded George. The three boys were aiming their wands at the new arrival."Where do you think he is? He's dead," scoffed Valek. "But don't worry about missing him, since you'll be joining him in a few moments.""Over our dead bodies," stated Fred, trying to sound brave."Well… that's pretty much the point," said Valek, frowning."When we survive this, we're going to have to work a bit on your come-backs," advised Lee. The three boys had begun slowly moving backwards down the corridor."Don't worry, you won't survive," said Valek, his smile revealed a row of sharp and crooked teeth."More like, you won't survive," said George, dramatically. He pulled out the unicorn horn from his pocket and threw it with all his might. He gasped in triumph as it hit Valek squarely in the chest, but any joy was short-lived when he saw the horn drop to the ground while his target remained uninjured. "I don't understand. I thought that would kill you.""Oh, unicorn horn is dangerous for me. If it touches my skin it burns, if I'm stabbed with one it would probably kill or at least seriously injure me," he said, looking down at the horn. He put one foot onto it and stepped down. There was a snap as the horn split into three pieces. "But I'm wearing clothes you imbecile, of course it's not going to hurt me if it touches my clothes.""I could have told you that," whispered Lee. "Great, we're down to one horn now.""Tell you what," said Valek, slowly walking towards the boys. "If you give up now, I'll offer you a quick and painless death. If you drag this out longer than it needs to be… well then you are going to suffer.""You don't have your wand," said Fred, quickly."I lost it fighting your uncle but as I told you before, I don't need my wand," said Valek. He flexed his hands to emphasise the sharp pointed nails."Yeah but to use them you need to get close," advised Fred. He took his unicorn horn out of his pocket and held it in front of him. Valek stopped moving. "And if you do, I can get you with this.""You might get me," said Valek, starting his advance again. "But then again, I'm willing to bet that I'm fast enough to kill you before you can kill me. I did want this to be a straight forward assassination, quick and easy with all loose ends tied up. But you and your uncle proved to be a lot more trouble than I expected, so instead I've decided to go with painful and unpleasant.""Any ideas, guys?" said Fred, holding the unicorn horn in one hand while aiming his wand with the other."I'm working on something," said George, who had been muttering under his breath for the last few seconds while he carefully manoeuvred his wand. "Get ready to run.""So… er… I heard that Dumbledore will be back any second," said Lee."Really? That's your best attempt to delay me?" snarled Valek. "This has gone on enough. Prepare to die.""Accio horn," muttered George, using the same wand movement he had been trying surreptitiously. This time it work and the broken pieces of horn jumped up from the ground and flew towards him. Unfortunately for Valek, he was standing right in their path. He turned his head at the sound of movement behind him and the pieces slammed into the side of his face."Run," advised Fred. Valek let out a loud screech as he clasped his face with his hands. Wafts of smoke drifted up from between his fingers."This way," said George, pointing at a suit of armour. He pulled down on the armour's left shoulder and a doorway opened up behind.The three boys piled inside and ran down a hidden corridor. George led the way with his wand pointed out in front of him. At the end of the corridor they stepped out from behind an ornate tapestry into one of the rarely used classrooms. George ran through the room to the door, he opened it and peered outside."Did he follow us?" asked Lee, aiming his wand towards where they had just exited."I don't think so," said Fred. "It closed before he could come through, and I don't think he saw how you opened it.""Right, he doesn't know the castle like we do," said George, thinking quickly, as the three boys stepped out into the long corridor. "He's tracking us by smell, probably, so what route is he going to take to get to us.""He'll come down that way," said Fred, pointing."So we go the other way," said George."Or not," said Lee. As the boys turned to head in their chosen direction Valek appeared at the end of the corridor in front of them."New plan. This way," said George, turning and running.Lee and Fred didn't need telling twice since once Valek had spotted them he began racing towards them. George race to the end of the corridor and sped up a set of stairs to the next level with his brother and friend in close pursuit. Fred, at the rear of the trio, kept firing spells over his shoulder in an attempt to stop, or at least slow, Valek, but his attempts were having little to no effect."This way," barked George, diving into one of the class rooms. As Fred, sped inside. George slammed the door shut and the three of them threw their weight against the wood just as Valek barrelled into the other side. It pushed open a small amount before the boys could close it again."Find something to push against it," said George, pressing his back against the door and trying to wedge his feet into place."Here," said Fred. He rushed over to the teacher's desk and pulled it over. It took all of his strength to move it, even with Lee's help but they eventually managed to barricade the door."Now what?" said Lee, looking around the room. "There's no way out of here.""There's one way," said Fred, pointing at the windows."We're a floor up," said Lee. "We'll break our legs.""It's grass, we'll be fine. Just roll when you hit the ground. We do it all the time," advised George. There was a thump at the door again. "Unless you'd prefer to wait for him to get through.""I think I'd take the window if we were on the seventh floor," said Lee.They opened one of the windows and Fred climbed out. He lowered himself as much as he could before pushing himself away from the wall and dropping down onto the ground. He rolled on the floor as he landed and sprang up to show the others he was fine."See? Just like George said.""Fine," said Lee, climbing out. He followed Fred's example except he didn't have as much of a successful landing."You okay?" asked Fred."Just banged my arm," said Lee, massaging his shoulder. "Come on George."George jumped down and the three boys made their way around the side of the school until they found a door inside. The door led into a small room with a door on each wall. George opened the one that was on their left and it revealed a small staircase spiralling in both directions. The went upwards. The stairs went up at least two flights before it stopped at a small door about half their size. George opened it and peered out. It led into a large corridor. Crouching down on all fours each of the boys crawled through the doorway."I swear it started to shrink," complained Lee, who had to be pulled out the last little bit. Sure enough, when he turned around the door was now clearly too small for anyone to fit through. He shook his head. "This school.""Right," said George, looking to see where they were, "we're on the third floor… and I think this is the Charms corridor. Which means the corridor with the three-headed dog is at that end.""Okay, so we head the other way," said Fred pointing."The door's growing again," said Lee, shaking his head. The twins looked down and sure enough the door they had just come through was starting to stretch. "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to go to a muggle school.""Far too boring," said George."But much safer I'll bet," said Lee. The door had now grown to the same size it was when the boys had crawled through."Yeah," nodded Fred, "but where's the fun in…"Fred's sentence had been cut short by Lee's scream. The growing door had opened and a scaly hand had reached out and grabbed Lee's ankle."Got you!" snarled Valek, his sharp nails dug into the boy's skin and he began pulling Lee towards him."We've got you," said Fred, as he and George grabbed hold of Lee's arms and held onto him.Valek continued to tug on Lee's leg, while the twins pulled back with all their might. Suddenly Valek let go which sent the three boys sprawling backwards as they lost their footing. By the time they had stood up their assailant had pulled himself through the door way and was now blocking their path."Well, I've got to say, you two are proving rather difficult to kill," said Valek, brushing dust off of his knees. "I am going to take great pleasure in this.""Two? So… I can go?" ventured Lee."I haven't been paid to kill you, but I'll consider it an added bonus," said Valek."We're not dead yet," said Fred, taking the unicorn horn out of his pocket. George and Lee aimed their wands."Remember," said Lee, under his breath, "indirect spells only.""I just beat two Aurors and your uncle, do you think you three will pose a problem?" laughed Valek."Any ideas?" said Fred, not taking his eyes off of his target."We could head into one of the classrooms," said Lee, looking behind them. "But I don't think any of them have secret passageways, we'd have to climb out a window again but now we're on the third floor.""Okay we back up," said George. "I have an idea.""Make all the plans you want," said Valek, sneering. "It won't make any difference."The three boys continued moving all the way to the far end of the corridor until they only had about twenty or so feet behind them."You've run out of room," said Valek."Now what?" asked Lee."Remember at Halloween when the troll got into the dungeon? Do you remember the spell you used when Filch was chasing us?" said George, quickly."In the dungeons?" said Lee. He smiled when he recalled the spell. "Yeah I remember.""Get ready to do that.""What about us?" said Fred."We…"Valek chose that moment to attack. He leapt forward towards Fred and grabbed the boy's wrist that held the unicorn horn. He raised his other hand ready to claw at Fred but George had already sprang into action. While continuing to try to hold onto his wand George used both his hands to seize the creature's arm. Valek, still struggling to grip Fred's wrist, used his superior strength to push George to one side. George slammed into the wall and slid down onto his knees. Valek went to aim a kick at the boy's head but at the last minute Fred pulled on his arm to make him lose his balance. As Valek tried to regain his composure Lee raced towards him. The boy slid on the floor at the last minute so that he barrelled into one of Valek's leg.Valek stumbled to one side whilst still trying to maintain his grip on Fred's arm. George had already recovered and launched himself at the creature. He slammed into Valek's back causing him to stumble forward. Fred grimaced as the claws around his wrist dug into his skin. Valek tried desperately to reach over his shoulder and grab at George who had now leapt onto his back and began hitting him on the top of his head with the base of his wand. Valek managed to scratch George a few times before Lee latched onto his arm and held it with both his hands folded over his chest."I'm going to kill you all," snarled Valek, who now had Lee, Fred and George weighing him down."Quick," ordered George, dropping down onto the ground. "Push."He barged his shoulder into Valek's back and propelled the creature forward with all his might. Fred and Lee likewise used their strength to push as hard as they could. Just as they reached the door at the end of the corridor, George kicked one of the feet out from under Valek. The surprise of falling caused him to release his grip on Fred's wrist before Valek fell into the door pushing it open and rolling inside. Lee grabbed hold of the handle and went to pull the door shut but before he could slam it completely Valek was able to lodge a forearm into the gap."He's pulling it open," warned Lee as he strained to hold the door."I've got this," said Fred, racing forward and jamming the unicorn horn hard into the exposed flesh. Valek let out a scream and quickly pulled his arm back inside allowing the boys to shut the door. George and Lee held onto the doorknob and braced themselves, while Fred readied the unicorn horn in case he needed to use it again."Hang on," said George, looking around. "Isn't this the third floor?""Yeah," said Fred, not taking his eyes off the door. "So?""That would make this the third floor corridor," explained George, as he and Lee held onto the door. It jerked open a fraction before they were able to close it once again."Is this really the time for this?" asked Lee between deep breaths."Remember what's on the other side of this?" said George, raising his voice over the shouts of planned violence from behind the door."A lizard nut job?" said Lee."Other than him.""Oh," said Fred, once the Knut dropped. "You mean Fluffy.""Yep," said George.The boy's looked at each other, then at the door. Valek was no longer shouting. All they could hear was a low growl that reverberated around them. The doorknob twisted again and George and Lee held on as hard as they could. From the other side of the door Valek let out an ear-piercing scream which was quickly and suddenly silenced.

After a few seconds of stillness, George and Lee let go of the door."Do you think…" began Lee."Yep," nodded Fred solemnly."And there's no way he…" said Lee, as George pressed his ear against the door."Nope," said Fred, shaking his head."Can you hear anything?" asked Lee."I think I can hear chewing," said George, standing back and looking a bit nauseous."Should we check?""If you want," said George, pointing towards the door."Maybe not," said Lee."Weren't you supposed to make the floor icy? Like you did to Filch at Halloween," said George. "That way he would have slipped over and we could have run.""When he attacked I sort of forgot," said Lee sheepishly. "But I think it turned out for the best in the end.""Now what," said Fred, in an exasperated tone. They could hear footsteps quickly approaching from the stairs towards the other end of the corridor."Well, we did make a lot of noise," said George, as the three boys turned around to greet the new arrivals. The three new arrivals. The three, rather unexpected, new arrivals."Enoch!" exclaimed Fred breaking into a wide smile as their uncle, Miro and Lexington raced into the corridor. The three men were covered in dirt and blood."Where's the Kosa?" demanded Lexington, with his wand darting left and right. The man had a nasty looking gash above his right eye which was bleeding profusely."He's through there," said Lee, pointing at the door. "But you don't need to worry about him.""I'll be the judge of that," said Lexington, striding forward. He opened the door, stepped inside and closed it behind him. Two seconds later he opened the door and stepped back into the corridor, and closed the door once again. He leaned against the door and looked rather pale. "Yeah, we don't need to worry about him.""Why? Is he there?" said Miro. The Auror-in-training had a number of scratches and burn marks on his face, and was holding one arm gingerly across his chest."Mostly there," nodded Lexington. "A lot of him is… not there.""What are you going on about?" said Enoch. Like the other two he was covered in injuries."There's a giant three headed dog that lives behind that door," said Lee."Pfft," snorted Enoch. He opened the door and stuck his head inside. He closed it quite quickly. "Huh? A three headed dog. You don't get many of those these days.""First time I ever saw one," said Lexington in a wooden voice."Yeah…" said Enoch in a similar tone. "That's a lot of blood.""I didn't even notice the blood," said Lexington. "I was mainly fixated on the chewing.""Yep, it's going to take a lot to get that image out of my head," agreed Enoch."So that's it then?" asked Lee. "He's dead.""Well if he wasn't we'd be hearing a lot more screaming," said Enoch."I mean I worked a number of Death Eater cases back in the day but that…" said Lexington, still in shock, "… you just can't prepare for seeing something like that.""You're hurt," said Enoch, looking at Fred's wrist. It was bleeding from where Valek's claws had pierced the skin."You can talk," said Fred, nodding at his uncle's injuries. "We saw a bright flash from the Quidditch Pitch. We thought you were dead.""So did we," admitted Enoch. He slapped Miro on the shoulder. "Probably would have been if it weren't for young Miro here. He pulled a Coffin Dodger.""A what?" said George."That's not what it's called," scolded Lexington. "He performed a rather tricky solid matter transition on us and himself after he initiated an Explosion curse to use as cover.""That made even less sense than Enoch, and that's saying something," said Fred."He did an Explosion curse which caused the bright light," explained Enoch. "While Valek was temporarily blinded, Miro did a spell that dragged the three of us beneath the sand on the Quidditch pitch. Valek must have thought we died in the explosion. We had to dig our way back out once we had regained consciousness.""Sorry about that," said Miro, sheepishly. "If I hadn't dropped my wand when we were moving through the sand I would have been able to get us straight out.""Nonsense," said Lexington. "We were lucky that you thought of it. He'd already disarmed and knocked us two out. If you hadn't done what you'd done we'd probably all be dead.""Thanks," said Miro, smiling. He winced as he tried to move his arm."Come on," said Lexington. "We'll head out of the school grounds and Apparate to St Mungo's to get you all fixed up.""We have an Infirmary in the school," said Lee."No it's fine, must get back to London as soon as possible and start writing up my report. The Minister of Magic will want to read all about this," said Lexington."Probably best if you left me and the boys' names out of that report," advised Enoch. "I don't exactly have a good name up at the Ministry and they're less likely to dismiss it if I'm nowhere near it."As you wish. Are you coming?""I'll head back down the Quidditch pitch first and disarm the traps that didn't go off," said Enoch."Good thinking." The Auror turned to look at the boys. "Great work tonight lads. If you ever want to join the Aurors let me know, I'll put in a good word for you in a heartbeat. All the best.""See you," said Enoch, shaking the man's hand. Miro nodded goodbye as well. The two made their way back down the corridor and took the stairs down. Enoch turned to look at the boys. "Well, why am I not surprised you didn't go back to Gryffindor Tower?""We tried," said Fred, while his uncle took a closer look at his wounded wrist. "We accidentally dropped and broke the potions and Valek found us before we could get somewhere safe.""It all turned out fine in the end," said Enoch. He reached into his pocketed and pulled out a strip of gauze, which be began wrapping around the boy's arm. "This should help, it's been enchanted. If only we'd known one of Valek's weaknesses was a giant three headed dog, we could have sorted this out months ago.""That feels better already," said Fred. "Yeah, we should probably ask them to update the book in the library.""Why is there a three headed dog…" began Enoch."Fluffy. His name is Fluffy," said George."Seriously?" said Enoch, looking at Fred and Lee for confirmation. "Why is Fluffy being kept in the school?""I did think about that," said Lee, "and I came up with only one reasonable explanation.""Which was?""It's Hogwarts," said Lee, shrugging."That sounds about right," nodded Enoch. "Look, I'm going to head back down the pitch and clean it up a bit. You three head off to the Infirmary.""Probably not a good idea," said George. "Seeing as how we're not supposed to be out of bed.""Yeah, apart from this," said Fred, holding up his arm, "we're pretty much okay.""Fine," said Enoch as he walked away. "But go to bed at least. Come see me over in Hogsmeade tomorrow.""Will do," said George. He turned to his brother. "How's the wrist?""Much better," said Fred, holding his arm up and pointing to the bandage. "This is helping a lot.""Good, we have Ravenclaw on Saturday so I'd hate to think what Oliver would do if one of us was injured," said George."Yeah, he'd make Valek look like a stroll through the courtyard," said Fred. "How about you two?""Mainly just bruises and cuts," said Lee, checking himself over. "Nothing nearly as bad as what normally happens when I'm around you two.""What about Ron and his friends?" said George."Oh I don't think anything bad has ever happened to me when I've been around them," said Lee, shaking his head."No, I meant, should we try and get them some help. Assuming they went down that trapdoor, can they get out? Because we've seen what Fluffy will do if they try getting out back through the trapdoor.""There has to be another way out of there," said Fred hopefully. "Don't you think?""I dunno. If Fluffy was supposed to be guarding the trapdoor it wouldn't make sense that there is another way out," said Lee, scratching his chin."We're going to have to tell someone are we?" said George, letting out a sigh. "Who do you reckon will give us the smallest punishment?""Flitwick or probably Quirrell," said Lee."Nah, Quirrell would get one of the others. Most likely Snape," said Fred."What about Hagrid? He knows all about magical creatures and he's not a teacher so I'm not even sure if he can punish us," said George."What about Enoch?" said Lee. "He won't punish us. Plus he's Ron's uncle as well so he'll definitely want to help.""Good thinking," said George, breaking into a slight jog. "If we hurry, we can catch him before he gets too far."They found their uncle about half way down to the Quidditch pitch and quickly explained the situation to him. The foursome raced back up to the third floor corridor, which now contained two new additions just outside the forbidden door. Propped against the wall were two rather old looking brooms."Okay, those weren't there before," said Fred, pointing at the brooms."What are you doing here?" said a voice behind them."Headmaster!" exclaimed Lee. Dumbledore rushed towards them with a concerned look upon his face."We were just…" began Fred before his explanation faltered."And then we…" mumbled George."Have you been through this door?" said Dumbledore. His usual kind friendly demeanour had been replace by a far more serious tone."No, not us," said Fred, quickly. "But Ron did.""Along with Harry and what's her face," said George, clicking his fingers."Hermione," added Lee."Hermione, that's the one," said George. "They went through and I think they went down some kind of trapdoor.""I've already spoken to Ms Granger and Mr Weasley, they are both fine I assure you," said Dumbledore. He turned to look at the twin's uncle. "Enoch, I'm not going to even ask why you are here.""Probably for the best," nodded Enoch."Can you escort the boys back to Gryffindor Tower? I believe they have a tendency to wander off otherwise.""Of course," said Enoch."Er… sir?" said Lee, as Dumbledore went to open the door. "You should be careful, there's a…""Fluffy?" said Dumbledore smiling. "Thank you for your concern Mr Jordan but I'm sure I will be fine."The boy's watched as Dumbledore opened the door. The Headmaster took out his wand and waved it. A small golden violin appeared, floating in mid-air. It started to place a slow melodic tune and the boys watched in amazement as Fluffy's three heads began to yawn and its eyes started drooping. Within seconds the formidable creature was fast asleep with its heads resting over its paws."Probably best if you stayed on that side of the door," advised Dumbledore as he opened the trapdoor. "Just in case the music stops.""You don't have to tell us twice," replied Lee. They watched as the Headmaster dropped down into the open void."I thought you said there was a lot of blood," said Fred to his uncle as he looked around the room from the doorway. "All I see is drool.""I think it licked it all up," said Enoch, looking a bit sick. He pointed at one of Fluffy's heads. "Pretty sure that's a finger stuck between his teeth.""Did not need to see that," said George, letting the door close shut."Come on boys, back to the Tower," advised Enoch."We can make our own way back," said Fred. "If you want to get back down to the Quidditch pitch.""I promised Dumbledore, remember?" said Enoch. "Besides, we all know he is right. You lot would get distracted by something on the way back and probably end up fighting a dragon or something.""Hey, that's never happened," complained Fred, as they began to make their way back. "Not that it wouldn't be cool.""Have you ever fought a dragon?" asked George."No," admitted Enoch. "Although I did once come across a rather angry fire-breathing chicken, so that's almost basically the same thing."It didn't take them long to reach the Gryffindor Tower. They said goodnight to Enoch and made their way through the Fat Lady portrait. As they entered they could hear voices coming from the Common Room."I'm so sorry Neville," said a female voice."Yeah mate, we had no choice," said a male voice, which the twins instantly recognised as belonging to their younger brother and so presumed the female voice was Hermione's."Harry?" called Hermione as Lee and the twins entered the room."No not quite," said Fred."Merlin's Beard," exclaimed Ron. "What are you doing up?""Sorry Ron, didn't know you were in charge of our bedtimes," said George."You look like a mess," said Ron."You can talk," countered Fred nodding at his brother. Both Ron and Hermione were covered in mud, dust, bruises and cuts. "Looks like your night was as interesting as ours.""I bet ours was more interesting," said Ron."Come on then," said George, sitting down on one of the armchairs. "Let's hear it."The two groups of friends swapped stories about their night while they waited for Harry to arrive, but after an hour or so they began to worry that something bad had happened to their friend. Hermione reasoned that if Harry had been injured he would have been taken directly to the Hospital Wing. After a bit a pleading with one of the portraits in the Common Room its inhabitant agreed to visit another painting which hung on the Infirmary wall. Sure enough it reported that Harry had been found by Dumbledore and was now resting unconscious in bed. With that, everyone decided that it would be a good idea to head to bed themselves. The night's exertions were particularly exhausting for Lee and the twins and none of them even bothered to change their clothes before falling into a deep sleep on top of their covers.At breakfast the next day the whole school was buzzing with the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione's adventure in the catacombs beneath the forbidden third floor corridor, much to the annoyance of the twins who found that most people didn't believe their own story."I'm telling you it happened, right?" said George grumpily."Oh yeah sure," said Angelina laughing. "A deadly creature, that was supposedly extinct, is able to defeat two Aurors and an old Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher but somehow gets beaten by you.""Not just me.""Oh yeah, I forgot about Wingus and Dingus over there.""Wingus, Dingus, tell her," said George, addressing his brother and Lee."Am I Wingus or… you know what? Doesn't matter. It definitely happened," said Fred."Oh well, if it 'definitely' happened, that makes all the difference," said Alicia, rolling her eyes."Ah, but how do you explain this?" said Fred, lifting his arm up to show the bandage still wrapped around it."What? You mean the bandage that you could have just wrapped around your wrist yourself?" said Angelina, raising an eyebrow."Fine, I meant this." Fred untucked one end of the bandage and unwrapped it before triumphantly holding his arm out for examination. Unfortunately for him the skin had completely healed. "Oh… well it's a magical bandage.""What about all our cuts and bruises?" asked George."Exactly," nodded Fred."You're always covered in cuts and bruises. It's basically how people describe you. The red headed twins with cuts and bruises," countered Alicia."How come everyone believes Ron's story but not ours?" complained Lee."Because they had Hermione with them," stated Alicia. She pointed her fork in the direction of Hermione and Ron who were sitting together at the far end of one of the tables. "She wouldn't lie.""And we would?" asked George, looking astounded."You lied so you could have the last sausage," said Angelina."I have low sausage levels," said George indignantly. " I have a note from Madam Pomfrey.""Well let's see it then," said Alicia, holding her hand out expectantly."Oh, well I left it in my room," mumbled George."Right," said Alicia, shaking her head. "Anyway, it's not like they run out of sausages, you could have just walked down the table and picked up another platter of them.""Yeah but Madam Pomfrey said I shouldn't overdo things for the next few days either. She also gave me a note for that. I left that in my room as well.""Sure," said Angelina sarcastically.A sudden hush fell over the room. Snape had just walked entered. He slowly looked around the room. Everyone lowered their gaze as his eyes fell over them."I thought Hermione and Ron said they had been trying to stop Snape from getting the Philosopher's Stone," said Lee, leaning forward and keeping his voice low."She did. It mustn't have been him," said George."But who else," said Fred. He leaned up and looked over at the teacher's table. "They're all there except for… Hagrid and Quirrell.""I saw Hagrid earlier," said Angelina."So Quirrell then?" said Lee, looking uncertain. "That can't be right. The guy's afraid of his own shadow."The same thoughts must have run through the minds of every student in the room as a low murmuring of hushed gossip quickly spread throughout the Hall. It was all everyone could talk about. Well, almost everyone."Morning team," said Oliver, beaming from ear to ear. "I hope you all had a great night sleep. Just one more practice today before the final match tomorrow. I have a good feeling about it, a really good feeling.""Er… haven't you heard?" said Lee slowly."Heard what?""Harry's in the Infirmary," said Alicia. "He's been there since last night.""Why? Who's he visiting?" said Oliver, still smiling.

"You know, I don't think I've seen Oliver cry before," said Lee, holding his wand in front of him to light the way. Lee, George, and Fred were traversing one of the secret tunnels into Hogsmeade."I've certainly never heard him swear before," said George."'Fudgenuggets' isn't really a swear word though is it?" said Fred, from the back of the group."It probably is in Wood's house," said Lee. "Oh here we are."At the end of the tunnel there was a trapdoor in the ceiling which lead into Honeydukes' cellar. The three boy's quickly made their way up the wooden stairs and crept out into the shop making sure no one saw them. They made their way over to the Hog's Head where they expected to find their uncle but the grumpy barman told them that he had left earlier that day after an argument over the price of his room. They found him perched on a stool at the Three Broomsticks instead, along with Miro."I wondered when you three would turn up," said Enoch, beaming a wide smile at their approach. He dusted some dirt from George's shoulder. "Took the scenic route did you?""Alright guys," nodded Miro. He turned to the barmaid. "Three Butterbeers please.""Cheers," said Fred, as the drinks were poured and handed to the three boys."You deserve it," said Miro. "It's not every day you get to face a Kosa and live.""No Lexington?" said Lee, looking around the room."No, he's been in with the Minister of Magic since first thing this morning, I figured I might as well come and see if Enoch needed any help with the Quidditch Pitch. But it turned out he fixed it all last night.""Even Dumbledore himself would be hard pressed to notice anything had happened," said Enoch, smiling."Well, he has other things going on at the moment," advised Fred."Like what?"The boys brought Miro and Enoch up to speed with everything else that had happened in the school while they had been busy fighting Valek."Well that explains Fluffy then," said Enoch, shaking his head. "The Philosopher's Stone eh? What I wouldn't give to get my hands on that. Legally of course.""Of course," said Fred, grinning into his Butterbeer."Can anyone else hear that?" said George, frowning. "It sounds like tiny bell is ringing.""Oh that's me," said Miro. He started patting his pockets before he pulled out a small round mirror. The ringing sound got louder once it was out of his pocket. He tapped the surface of the mirror with his wand and the boys could just about see Lexington's face appear. "Oh hi Mr Lexington.""Miro, can you get somewhere private? There's much to discuss," said Lexington."Sure," said Miro, hopping up. "Excuse me.""What are those?" said Fred, stealing Miro's stool."Portable two-way mirror," said Enoch. "Standard issue when two Aurors are working in the field.""We could have done with one of those last night," said George."I think you did just fine without them," said Enoch."So what now for you?" asked Fred."I dunno," said Enoch, shrugging. "I might stick around for your match tomorrow, but after that who knows?""Might not be much of a match," advised Lee. "Harry's still out. I doubt he'll be allowed to play even if he woke up today.""I'm sure it'll be a good match either way," said Enoch.Enoch and the boys continued talking as they drunk their Butterbeers and had almost forgotten about Miro until he appeared back at their sides. He had a serious expression on his face when he returned."What's wrong?" asked Enoch."Lexington didn't have much time to talk," said Miro, quickly. "He had to cut me off when he was summoned back into the meeting.""Summoned? That doesn't sound good," said Enoch, frowning."Apparently Lexington submitted a full report on what happened last night. He left you four out of it of course. But once the Minister read it, he went ballistic. Started going on about 'raising unnecessary fears' and 'scaring the public' with 'unfounded rumours of Kosa'.""Unfounded? We all saw him," scoffed Lee."Yes, but it's not like there was any evidence left is there? They are trying to say that Lexington has finally lost his mind," said Miro. He looked furious."But that's a lie," snapped Fred. "They can't do that can they?""They're the Ministry, they can do what they like," sighed Enoch. "So what about you?""Lexington said that if I back him up it'll probably end my career as an Auror. At best they'll let me stay on but give me a desk job completing reports, at worst they'll sack me," said Miro, bitterly. "He wants me to lie and say he made up the whole thing.""What about us? We all saw Valek as well," stated George."Yes but Lexington already filed the report saying it was just us. If we suddenly say you four were there as well they'll just say you're lying as well. Plus they aren't going to stake much on the word of three Hogwarts' students and the Ministry isn't the best place for you uncle right now.""Why not?" asked Enoch."Something about some magical artefacts that were returned in less than pristine condition," said Miro."Ah… yes… probably a good place for me to avoid," said Enoch."So what are you going to do?" said Lee."I don't know. I have two choices; Lie, and say Lexington made it all up, or tell the truth and risk losing my job," sighed Miro. "The worst part is that Lexington wants me to lie.""Why would he do that?" said Fred, frowning."Because he is a good man," said Enoch. "Doesn't want a promising career ruined because of Ministry politics. Whatever happens Lexington is out but he doesn't want to take Miro down with him.""Well that sucks," muttered George."Guess I don't have much time to make my decision," said Miro, looking out of the window. The group turned to see that outside there were two serious looking men in tweed suits walking towards the entrance. "Must have just Apparated. Lucky that Lexington was able to call me when he did."The two men entered the Three Broomsticks and looked around the room. As soon as they saw Miro they approached. Enoch turned away on his stool and rested his forehead on his hand to cover his face."Miro Franca? Auror-in-training?" asked one of the men in a gruff voice."That's me.""Can you come with us back to the Ministry?" said the man in a way that indicated his question wasn't so much a query as it was an order."Sure," sighed Miro, putting his drink down. "I'll talk to you guys later.""Let us know how it goes," said George."Not if its classified he won't," snapped the second man.They watched as Miro was escorted from the pub, and the three men Apparated away. With Miro's departure the mood took a solemn turn and the boys didn't really feel much like celebrating over Butterbeers. They bid their uncle goodbye and made their way back to the school. The bad news didn't end there either.On the way they bumped into Oliver who had just come from the Infirmary. Harry was still unconscious and would definitely miss the final Quidditch match of the year. Despite their best efforts to find a suitable replacement to fill the role of Seeker the Gryffindor team were steamrollered by Ravenclaw and Slytherin won the Quidditch Cup again along with the overall House Cup as well. It took the rest of the team nearly two days, just in time for the end-of-year feast, to coax Oliver back out of his room.The Great Hall was decorated in the Slytherin colours of green and silver, with a huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covering the wall behind the High Table where the teachers sat. Fred, George and Lee were seated across from Angelina and Alicia with the rest of the Gryffindor third years. They were talking animatedly about their plans for the summer when a sudden hush fell over the room. Each of them craned their necks to try and see why everyone had gone quiet."It's Harry," said George, spotting the cause of the commotion. "Must have been let out of the Infirmary.""Do you think it really happened? The whole Quirrell You-Know-Who thing?" asked Angelina, as the room started talking once again."That's what Ron and Hermione said," replied Lee."Yeah but they were only repeating what they were told by Harry," explained Angelina. "He's been unconscious for three days, I heard about someone who got bumped on the head and when they woke up the next day they couldn't remember their own name.""Well Quirrell's certainly gone," said Fred, looking over at the teacher's table. "And everything else they told us about what happened turned out to be true. Plus I don't think Harry would like."It seemed that everyone else in the room was having pretty much the exact same conversation. Eyes followed Harry across the room until he found space next to Ron and Hermione. Not soon after Dumbledore arrived in the Great Hall and took his place at the top of the room behind the large ornate lectern. The babble died away."Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts... Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two."A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table."Gits," mumbled George, while Fred and Lee nodded in agreement."Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent events must be taken into account."The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little, and the rest of the school sat up straight."Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... First: to Mr. Ronald Weasley... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points."Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Fred and George whooped loudly and waved at their little brother who had gone a deep shade of purple, while Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!"At last there was silence again."Second: to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points."Once again Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves : they were a hundred points up. Fred, George and Lee, were banging their fists against the wooden table while Angelina let out a roar of triumph and hugged Alicia."I always liked that girl," said Fred."Third: to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet, "for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points."The din was deafening."We've won the cup!" shouted Fred, pumping his fists into the air."Champions!" bellowed George."No, you idiots," said Angelina above the noise. "We're on four hundred and seventy-two points. Exactly the same as Slytherin. We're tied for the cup. If only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point."Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent."There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Fred, George and Lee stood up to yell and cheer while elbowing their way towards Neville who had disappeared under a number of people hugging him. The three boys leapt on top of the group in celebration causing it to topple over pile onto the floor."Which means," Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we need a little change of decoration."He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place."Ha," laughed Fred, from the floor. "Look at Snape's face."Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.The rest of the feast was a cacophony of cheer, with laughter and celebration ringing around most of the hall. The Slytherin table was decidedly mute and most of them left as soon as they had finished eating, but everyone else stayed long into the evening and for those students in Gryffindor the party continued back at their Common Room. After Fred and George carried Neville on their shoulders from the Great Hall to the Fat Lady's portrait they doubled back down to the kitchens several times and brought back armfuls of cakes, pastries and desserts for everyone to enjoy. The partying went on to just after midnight when Professor McGonagall arrived and shooed everyone to bed, she even waited in the Common Room so that the students could not sneak back down after she had left to continue their merrymaking.Soon the wardrobes were emptied and their trunks packed and the students were heading down to Hogsmeade Station. Hagrid took the first years down to the boat house to catch the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake while the rest took the usual routes to the carriages. As they were waiting to board teachers were busy handing out letters to each of the students to warn them not to use magic over the holidays."I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said George sadly."I said the exact same thing to Ron and Harry," said Fred. "I've actually been given three already.""It's like they don't trust us," replied Lee, who was holding two copies of the letter. After careful consideration Professor Flitwick handed each of them an additional one.The three boys climbed into a carriage by themselves and watched as the school slowly disappeared behind them."Any plans for the summer?" asked Fred, stretching his legs and arms."Nah, I've sure my parents have thought of something but I'm pretty much just looking forward to not having to get up for lessons," yawned George."Not you, you idiot," said Fred, elbowing his brother."No idea," said Lee, shrugging his shoulders. "My parents were planning on going away for the summer, but my dad has to work now. At least I'm not stuck with aunt Beryl."You should come and stay with us for a bit," said Fred. "I'm sure my mum would love to have you over."They reached Hogsmeade Station and disembarked the carriages. The train was already waiting for them and as usual the first years had arrived before them and boarded."Fred, George, Lee!" barked a voice as they reached the platform. They turned to see it belonged to their uncle. He was standing off to one side away from the crowd along with Miro."What are you doing here?" asked Fred."Thought I'd stick around for a few days and see you guys off," said Enoch."What about you?" said George, addressing Miro. "How did it go at the Ministry? Are you still an Auror?""Nope," said Miro, who despite expectations looked rather pleased at divulging this information. "I couldn't turn on Lexington like that, and I wouldn't want to work for any place that would expect me too. So I quit.""What are you going to do now?" asked Lee."Easy," said Miro, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a small square card and handed it over."'Lexington Franca Wizarding Detective Agency, no job too big, small, or dangerous'" said Fred, reading the writing on the card over his friend's shoulder."A Wizarding Detective Agency?" said Lee, frowning."It was Lexington's idea. We talked about since first hearing about the Valek. We figured if the Ministry didn't want to look into certain things then there should be someone willing.""Surprised they didn't ask you," said George, turning to his uncle."Who said they didn't?" said Enoch, smiling."That's actually why I was here," nodded Miro."I'm not really one for a regular job though, but I might give them a hand if I find myself at a loose end.""Knockturn Alley?" said Lee, reading the address from the card. "Why would you set up there?""Lexington said we should get ourselves based right in the centre of where trouble is most likely. Plus it's all we can afford at the moment," said Miro. "It's a small office above a pie shop.""At least you won't have to travel far for lunch," said George."I never said what they put in the pies," said Miro. The boys couldn't tell if he was joking or not."Well once you've solved a few cases I'm sure you'll move somewhere a bit flasher, maybe even into Diagon Alley eventually," said Fred."That's the idea. Our first case is unpaid but we're hoping it'll help build our reputation enough that people start to seek us out.""What's the case? I bet some rich eccentric guy wants you to solve a murder," said Fred excitedly."Actually it involves you guys," said Miro."Hey, we haven't done anything," said George quickly. "Well you know what I mean, nothing bad… er… I mean nothing bad that would require investigating… hang on… nothing bad that…""Relax," said Miro holding his hand up. "I'm not investigating you, I'm investigating for you, and Enoch. You said that Valek mentioned someone sent him after you.""Yeah that's right," said George. "I'd completely forgotten about that.""Well that's what we're looking into. Look, I'll be in touch in a few days to interview you about it, see if you can remember anything else. Anyway, I'll see you guys around, okay?" said Miro, giving them a wave and backing away a few feet so Enoch could say his goodbyes."I guess this is it," said Enoch, shaking each of the boys' hands in turn. "You take care of yourselves you hear?""We always do," said Fred.The boys were the last to board the Hogwarts Express and leaned out of the window to wave to Enoch and Miro as the train pulled away from the station."I think it's a good thing," said Fred as the three boys walked through the train trying to find a compartment with spare seats."What?" asked Lee."That someone is investigating Valek. Sounds like the Ministry just brushed it under the carpet," said Fred."Yeah, and if they solve it we might become famous," agreed George."People would refer to it as 'The Case of the Kosa Assassin'," said Fred, waving his hand in an arch."That's a terrible name for… well… anything," said Lee, shaking his head."That's not that bad," countered Fred."It's pretty bad," said George."What would you call it then?""I dunno, how about 'The Weasley Twins and…""Hey, what about me?" interrupted Lee."'The Weasley Twins and Lee'?" said George, frowning. "It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue…"The trio continued to argue even after they settled into their seats and the Hogwarts Express pushed on through the countryside bringing everyone back home for the summer.
