## Research questions

With your collaborator, please tackle one of these research questions:

1. Which of the original seven novels mentions Harry the most (and least)? And which Hermione and Ron?

2. Which of the original seven novels mentions women or men characters most (and least)?

3. Pick a few fan fiction stories. Do they or J.K. Rowling mention Harry (or Ron or Hermione or others) more often?

4. Which words are mentioned in one novel and not in the other? Which words are mentioned by J. K. Rowling but not by the fan fiction author(s)? (Vice versa: which are mentioned by both?)

5. How are the spells of Harry Potter distributed across the novels? See: https://www.pojo.com/harry-potter-spell-list/

6. An interesting question of your own involving these texts and word counts.
